Short of having Tourette, I believe that challenging habits like "stop cursing all the time" will diminish naturally as we pursue fulfillment in life using strategies like FiVe that address our whole sense of person (and I've met folks with Tourette Syndrome when observed in their talents exhibit non of the behavioral symtoms). But what if you're still in the quagmire of your problems and these habits aren't fading? And what of a more direct approach for habits that are ready to "click" into place?<br><br>Could you use FV to track those habits that you were working on?<br><br>For the sake of clarity, let's break it down into three ways to phrase a habit:<br><br>1) Those habits which can readily become routinized - flossing after brushing teeth<br>2) Those habits measured conditionally upon completion, phrased in the affirmative. Such as "Whenever I find myself being drawn into an argument, I will first exercise X,Y,Z (take a deep breath, etc) skills." <br>3) Those habits measured conditionally, phrased in the negative. Such as "Didn't pick at my cuticles today"<br><br>You're welcome to think up better examples.<br>Cheers!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 April 2012 at 17:35 | James Levine</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I tried some things like this using AutoFocus, months ago, but now, thanks to Mark, I'm a Beeminder convert.<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.beeminder.com/">http://www.beeminder.com/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>28 April 2012 at 22:12 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I'll be following this. In my current chain is 3 Tiny Habits. I've had success with BJFogg's 3 Tiny Habits before. His recommendation is naming them as in your #1(among other things). I put it on my FV list a few days ago, it came up once and I decided what the 3 habits would be and that I'd start Monday. It's up today so I can phrase my items. <br><br>How will those fit into FV at that point? I think they won't. The nature of the way they're phrased, they'll have some outside trigger "After I do X, I'll do Y." Where X is something you do reliably and Y is the new habit you're trying to acquire. <br><br>I will probably put "Evaluate/Reflect on 3 Tiny Habits" onto my FV list after I do the phrasing. I may see fit to reflect throughout the week or I may leave it until the week has ended to do so. It'll be on the list, so we'll see. <br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://tinyhabits.com/">http://tinyhabits.com/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 April 2012 at 16:29 | Tortoise</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Just checking in. <br><br>Beeminder is interesting, and looks great for goals. But I'd be careful about putting a dozen trend-lines on there for fear of failing too often. Put it this way, it really encourages you to address habits and goals one at a time, and make sure that something clicks, which really is new habit forming rule #1. <br><br>Of course, I already tried breaking it, and I've had some successes with a couple things while juggling the dozen. I was using an App called Epic Win for the iPhone to track all sorts of things that wouldn't be described as a task. The beauty of this method is with Daily repeats you get rewards for what you do right, while the items that are not relevant that day or are simply not accomplished just show up the next day, rather than stack up, nag, or guilt you. But, I'm ready for something even more functional.<br><br>Another method might be to find a service that allows you to use a shared ready list. Something like wunderlist or trello, which I'm using, means that others bare witness, can lend a hand, root you on. Frankly, even a little trash talking will force you to put your money where your mouth is.<br><br>I just signed up for a tinyhabits.com seminar, and I'm amazed enough that such a resource could be available for free. I'm left wondering "what's the catch?" I missed the zenhabits workshop this winter due to scheduling and funds.<br><br>I should mention that none of the above resources come with a handbook on how to incorporate habit tracking within the FV system. In your case, Tortoise, I would see no harm in listing the established routine in your FV that will serve to recruit the new habit, as it fits my first example. <br><br>Another quality to this process is checking in, so an agreed amount of time would need to pass in order to check your accomplishments. Some might not come in at all if the new impulse was not needed that day. For example "Get business cards into my phone on the spot" would fail if no networking opportunities presented themselves that day. That's where I suspect you'd be doling money to beeminder.<br><br>You could put an item in FV that simply reads "Record habit tracking results" then go to your chosen platform and enter things in. <br><br>Which leads me to another quality of this work: baby steps nonetheless can't be seen as lines crossed off on a list. If your accomplishments go into a void after they're done, then you're really not tracking your progress. Some retrospective would be helpful. This is challenging because the value of the work will be hard to quantify unlike the FV results from boosts to your productivity. A reward or goal would be good, but the best reward I think in this case would be to actualize Dr. Fogg's 2nd Option, namely to change your context. That is, with a given amount of success, you help construct the environment that is conducive towards your recovery.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 May 2012 at 0:19 | James Levine</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Tasks are not like achievements.  <br><br>FV is a fine tool for setting out things to do, but it is not a tool to show things done.  If you want a record of what you have done, set up something for that.  It could be Beeminder, a time sheet, a log book, or just putting your finished work on display.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 May 2012 at 14:39 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I can't find the post now, but a couple of days ago, someone on this forum posted a link to timedoctor.com.<br><br>I am blown away by this free app, which I have used for two days now. I am using the free version for individuals, along with FV. It tracks my time in a very clever, elegant way. It even takes screenshots of my monitor every 3 minutes, so I can look back and see what was on my screen when I said that I was working on task X.<br><br>It has pop-ups which could be annoying, but, in fact, are quite helpful to ensure that I am doing what I told it I was doing.<br><br>If you go to their website, they are really aggressive in that they give you no information but want you to sign up right away for a free trial of the pay version. I ignored that and downloaded the free plan "with limited features."<br><br>This free plan gives all kinds of detailed reports on what tasks I was working on, for how long, what projects they were part of, what applications I used, what websites I visited, and when I took breaks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>2 May 2012 at 22:05 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>One thing I'm slowly noticing is that routines and "Check Ins" get sent down the list, which then encourages new, 1-off tasks to percolate to the top. Maybe an "Easter Egg" or reward task, upon arriving at the top, could then mark when accomplishments were due some recognition.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>3 May 2012 at 21:09 | James Levine</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I've been following beeminder (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.beeminder.com/">http://www.beeminder.com/</a> ) for years and I'm using it for 4 habits right now, highly recommend it.<br><br>I also urge everybody interested in habits to really try Tiny Habits (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://tinyhabits.com/">http://tinyhabits.com/</a> ) by BJ Fogg.
