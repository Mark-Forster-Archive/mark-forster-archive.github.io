Otherwise I would let myself be distracted from work items during designated working hours by doing less stressful home items.  It gives me the same structure that I would have if I worked away from home, and I need that structure to stay focused on getting business tasks done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 16:46 | Kim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I recently adopted and slightly adjusted a suggestion from somebody who's name I forgot. I've been using AF1 for the past months and almost two weeks ago, I started using separate pages (columns actually) for work and home tasks, but intermingled in the same book. Furthermore I'm writing work tasks in red and home tasks in blue. So I could have 5 'home' pages, a work page, two more home pages and then 2 work pages. When I'm at work, I only process the red pages (or columns) and rarely glance at the blue pages for something that might be urgent. And when I'm at home, I generally leave the red columns alone and only process the blue columns.<br><br>The advantage of having the work and home pages intermingled is that you're always aware of both your home and your work tasks, and you have only one book to enter stuff into.<br><br>See a picture of my book: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/426952/af1-workhome.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/426952/af1-workhome.jpg</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 20:15 | Tijl</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Also... I intend to use the same strategy when I switch to FV tomorrow.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 20:16 | Tijl</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Tijl:<br><br>I see in your photo what looks like dates to the left of some items. Just curious if you do the same as I do...add tickler dates for future items. These are ignored until the date comes. At that point, I re-enter at end of list. I do something similar for someday/maybe's. It keeps EVERYTHING on one list without interfering with the AF/SF/FV mechanics. <br><br>I draw a column on the left of each page. It's easy to see when any item has been completed, tickled or dotted. Future items are easily ignored while current items stand out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 12:59 | Scotthutchins</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Scott: good guess, but actually no.<br><br>The dates are written next to the starting point of that day. So for example to the left of the red pen is written '7-3' which for me (as a European) means the 7th of March. About ten tasks below that is written '8-3', i.e. the 8th of March. All tasks written between these two dates were entered on the 7th of March.<br><br>The reason I do this is twofold:<br>1) I have a clear idea how old certain tasks are, which may help in deciding whether the task should be actioned yet. So for example if I notice that there is an unactioned task called 'Vacuum' which is written on a date more than a month ago, I know it is time to vacuum my room :P.<br>2) It makes it very easy to see how well I'm progressing with my todos. When I start a new column every day or every two days, I know I'm doing well. If it took me two weeks to fill up the four columns on a double page, I know I'm not doing well and I have to pick up the slack.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 13:41 | TijlK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>For some reason it seems natural to combine the lists into one list.   So that's what I did.  About 300 items for work, and 300 items for personal.  I guess I'll see how it works out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 5:54 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Having returned to the fold, I am finding FV very good, been using it in paper/pen mode this week.<br><br>Like others, I am a bit torn about separate lists.

I work from home and don't particularly wish to distinguish between the two so I have only used one list for ages. But I think if I worked in an office and sharply distinguished between them, I would have two lists. So the answer really boils down to "Whichever works best for you."<br><br>What I can't imagine myself using under any circumstances is colour codes, extra columns, page divisions or any other methods of distinguishing tasks on the same page. That for me would make the cure worse than the problem. But I won't be sending the FV Police to stop people who are into that sort of thing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 7:31 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>As I wrote in another thread: at the transition from AF to FV I also switched to combining everything into one list. Previously I was easily distracted by seeing home-items on the list while at work and vice versa, which is why I kept separate lists (after some trial and error). Being distracted in one list is still somewhat the case with FV when making the preselection, but once the preselection is made I'm not bothered at all by anything between the preselected tasks, so it's much easier to stay in a flow. Plus, once the first task is preselected any following preselection-decisions are made with relevance to that first task, so the focus 'work' easily remains 'work' while preselecting. And all that while still remaining sensitive enough to urgent home-related tasks, such as making a call that has to be made during office hours.<br><br>So far, this works very nicely for me, but I'm only on the second day of FV now, so we'll see how it works out after a week or so...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 9:28 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I carry two lists but don't distinguish between personal and work.  For me the distinction is stuff that needs to be done during business hours and things that can be done after hours.  So I have many personal items on my "work" list - usually calls I need to make.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 11:24 | Simon C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Like Nicole I've switched to one list with FV and it's working well so far.  One list never worked for me in any of the AF/SF variations, so this is a big plus for FV.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 14:00 | Zane</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Thanks, everyone, for your very helpful input. Although I am in an office part of the week, I do quite a lot of work from home. However, one reason for trying to keep separate home and work lists was to prevent work tasks from taking over my life at home. I have experimented with separate notebooks, colour-coding, divided but on same page etc. etc. as well as electronic lists, filtering and so on. All this tinkering just made it all more complicated, and the simplicity of a single list appealed to me even though I struggled to make it work. <br><br>I think the point made by Nicole, who has moved to a single list with FV:<br><br>&lt;once the preselection is made I'm not bothered at all by anything between the preselected tasks, so it's much easier to stay in a flow.

If manual, I would go for the Post- It note attached to a shelf or my computer screen.<br><br>With preselection, one has to take into account context (work, personal, errands, chores) along with locations (home, work office,client office, travel, anywhere) because one cannot to home chores while travelling, for example, but 'Pay supplier's invoice £12,45' can be done anywhere one has online access.<br><br>Again, electronic applications score.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 March 2012 at 11:14 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Roger J.  I use pen and paper and working from a single list is very quick and easy. (Easier for me than an electronic app.)  There's no 'searching for the dots', I just look up the list until I get to a dot.  And one of the beauties of FV is that preselection is only done each time a ladder is completed, so if it does take me a few extra seconds to scan my list because it has mixed contexts and locations, that only happens a few times a day.  But mixed contexts don't seem to slow me down.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 March 2012 at 21:44 | Zane</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Roger J:<br><br>I use a single written list as I said above, and I can't imagine why I would want to write the preselected list on another page or card. As Zane has said, you don't have to search for the dots - you just move to the next one. The process of constructing the preselected list and working back through it gives you a real feel for your list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 March 2012 at 23:16 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
