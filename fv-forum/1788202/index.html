One of the things that suprised me was how many requests we've had for things that I might not think as being pure FV. Whilst a web app isn't ever really going to work the same as paper, an approach that makes the best of the advantages of a computerised system can be beneficial. Sometimes however, it can get in the way of the simplicity a pen and paper gives.<br><br>For example, Stats on performance are difficult on paper, but easy electronically. This raised the question which things should be implemented, possibly to enforce or guide the use of the system, and which things shouldn't be.<br><br>Tags is a good example we've pondered on. Tags in themselves are bad (I can see that from comments Mark has made), but with paper, people are keeping a work/home FV list in separate notebooks. Isn't that almost tags?<br><br>I'd love to hear some thoughts, as now we've just finished what we think is the core requirement for an electronic FV (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.blanclist.com/)">http://www.blanclist.com/)</a> we've got a long list of suggestions we need to work through.<br><br>Help! :D<br><br>~Steve</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 April 2012 at 1:16 | Steve from Blanc</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Hi Steve,<br><br>I'm quite satisfied with my digital FV combo of EN Windows and EN Android. However, I'm still interested in minimalist guided FV web apps, such as your <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.blanclist.com">http://www.blanclist.com</a> and Yunkyung Lee's <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://keepfocustodo.com">http://keepfocustodo.com</a> . I particularly like them for introduction to new FV users.<br><br>I and avrum gave our must have FV web apps features in KFT thread <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1759721">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1759721</a> , basically ...<br><br>(1) Offline mode/option (local cache ala EN Android or HTML5 local storage with full sync)<br>(2) Long notes per task (such as EN notes body)<br>(3) Exporting of notes (such as text, CSV, jason or xml; and importing too)<br><br>Looking at both BL and KFT screens side by side, I see ...<br><br>(a) BL more paper like oldest on top list, whereas KFT (like EN Android) have newest on top list. I think this is just a nice to have feature, not must have.<br>(b) BL provide focused preselected task one by one, but KFT works on full preselected list unguided.<br>(c) BL provide "manage" button to abort/modifiy preselected list, KFT have to complete/reenter all preselected tasks.<br>(d) BL allow "edit" rephrase tasks while in list and work mode, but KFT don't allow rephrasing even when reentering.<br>(e) BL only shows "done" task in separate screen, KFT shows them in one screen just like paper (I like this better).<br>(f) BL hide "done" and "save" buttons in list mode until you click the task, KFT have the done (X) button clearly on all active tasks in the list (I like this better).<br>(g) BL don't have tagging, KFT don't but have tagging but have "context" that works as independent  list, EN Android have full tagging features.<br>(h) BL don't have #2 long notes, but KFT &amp; EN Android have.<br>(i) BL &amp; KFT don't have #1 offline &amp; #3 export, but EN Android have.<br>(j) What EN have that are fully used by FV users should be the benchmark digital FV features, not just what is possible on paper.

I started out with a spiral notebook which I've been using since discovering Mark's work. It is the easiest way but can become cumbersome when transferring items to the page I'm currently working on. And it takes up space on my desk.<br><br>I also tried FV on Microsoft word for awhile and liked this way very much due to the ease of moving items up or down and crossing them off. <br><br>"Reminders," which comes with the iPhone is good but isn't FV ready because items cannot be moved within a task list. However, After learning about TaskPaper from Mark's blog, I found it the most enjoyable of all methods  to use for several reasons: TP is portable.  Tasks are easily crossed off and moved up and down within the list. And I can play with it, work with it, and fuss with my list at any odd moment. I like to finalize my list for the next day whilst lying in bed before sleep.<br><br> Finally, I'm most grateful for comments read on Mark's site because I'm learning more exquisite ways to put his marvelous teachings into practice.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 April 2012 at 17:30 | Randy Place</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Things I'd love (a first-draft brainstorm, so some of the ideas need work and others may not survive rational thought.)<br><br>- Search feature so I can easily find entries in a long list. This is useful if I want to work on something that isn't dotted, and if I want to check whether I've already added it. (One task got added four times. It was important and obviously sucking up brain power, but I couldn't actually do it for several days.)<br><br>- Repeat tasks at intervals. When I mop the floor, set it to go back on the list in a week. Also repeat by calendar day or day of month.<br><br>- Record when each task is done. If I know I've been good and rehearsed more days than not lately, I might want to do something else more. (Or, more likely, if I know I've skipped rehearsing more often than not...)<br><br>- Edit date done and tickler date. Most of the time I update the list every few hours, so that should be easy, but often enough it sits a few days.<br><br>- Print out. Nothing fancy, just a text file. All tasks, or just dotted tasks. Let us decide which fields to include. If tags aren't a formal part of the program, use the search function. "Print all tasks with the word 'errand' ".<br><br>- Long notes.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 April 2012 at 1:37 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>For me, the most important thing is that it must be -easy- frictionless to enter a new task.<br><br>Next is that it must be easy to see the current task chain at any time.<br><br>Third is clean presentation of the open task list for review.<br><br>Whatever else you can do must not compromise those three essentials.<br><br>Useful features would include:<br><br>- access from a portable device<br>- a clean list formatted for A4 folded twice across and once down (finally A7, with the first unfold giving you a long list the width of a portrait A7 page) (others may have different preferred formats), showing the current chain on the "front" A7 page)<br>- creation of new tasks by right clicking text or documents, keeping the text or documents as supporting detail<br>- reports and statistics<br><br>It will take a lot to move me off Outlook tasks (in particular, the integration with my email workflow...).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 April 2012 at 15:53 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Cricket,<br>&lt;&lt;Search feature so I can easily find entries in a long list.

It was important and obviously sucking up brain power, but I couldn't actually do it for several days.)&gt;&gt;<br><br>A colleague of mine had this strategy for keeping our lab stocked with tools and supplies: if I cannot get hold of a tool (screwdriver) when I need it, buy another one. Eventually we will have enough on hand that there will always be one available / in view / within reach. That worked better than proselytizing to those who didn't naturally put things in predictable places! And it was easier than conducting an analysis of how many tools were actually needed and where they should optimally be placed. (Does *every* bench need an oscilloscope?)<br><br>The application to FV (or AF/SF): if you think of something to do and are not sure it's on the list, write it again. Eventually you will see it sufficiently often to know it is taken care of, without having to whip yourself into achieving a given rate of page turns or ladder constructions.<br><br>That being said, if I used an electronic version, the main reasons would be to gain a search function and the ability to annotate without breaking the flow of scanning my list. Search would be not so much for avoiding duplicate entries as for general maintenance or looking up reference info. Especially once I've entered annotations, I'd want to search them for a phone number or invoice date or who volunteered to do task X at the meeting.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 April 2012 at 17:16 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Bernie, if my father bought a new tape measure every time he lost his when building the cottage, he'd have an entire room of them! Mom's is oversize and bright pink, so she can find it even after Dad borrows it. There's a middle ground. I keep a pen and pad everywhere I might want to take notes -- by the calendar, fridge, desk, bedside table and purse, but balk at buying a new batch of pens every month because the kids lose them. <br><br>As for oscilloscopes, those are expensive and heavy. They break if dropped while moving. The users are expensive -- the time spent waiting for one to be free, or moving it, or re-adjusting it, or finding the high-voltage probe that didn't get moved with it can rapidly add up. So, yes, one per tech or bench or project might be appropriate.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 April 2012 at 20:17 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I love your BlancList implementation of FV, Steve. My only complaint at this point is that it's tied to a web browser. A native app is the only way I'd ever consider leaving my current setup using Clear.<br><br>Also, I have many "workflows" that I make use of once per week. I have an items in the FV list referencing these workflows (e.g. "Sunday morning workflow," "Podcast workflow," etc.). When that task comes to the front I leave the FV list and go to the workflow list to begin knocking it out. This keeps clutter down in the FV list so I'm not seeing the individual tasks contained within the workflows which don't really make sense to "dot."<br><br>I suppose such a thing can be achieve in the notes section of any given task sufficiently, however.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 April 2012 at 5:19 | Zack Allen</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Wow, great feedback, I'm gonna process all of that, and get back with a response. In a lot of cases it's going to be, "we're working on that" or "that's added to my list".<br><br>I guess the main thrust I was after, was should the app 'police' the user into following the system, or just provide the features that support it. For example @sabre23t's point (b) about the other system being unguided. Is that good with FV, or would something that only let you work the system as prescribed be a better solution (as much as we may not 'like' it) ?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 April 2012 at 10:09 | Steve from Blanc</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Zack - Just as a question, if the webapp worked offline once cached, and auto-synced with the server once you reconnected, would that make you switch from Clear?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 April 2012 at 20:02 | Steve from Blanc</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>It's a good solution, but not good enough for me (I pay for software I like, btw). Using a webapp means losing precious screen real estate to the browser UI, not to mention the necessary header space for login, etc.<br><br>Clear makes full use of the available screen by hiding menus and making input quick and intuitive without needing an "add" button.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 April 2012 at 20:11 | Zack Allen</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Zack, coolio, I was just curious, as it's something we have in the pipeline. Clear is great I think it's really innovative. I was just interested in where you're at. You can save the web app to the home-screen to save a fair bit of real estate, but not as much as clear.<br><br>We may not need to go the pay-for route, purely because the web-app/hosting is being provided by work. All Blanc employees are using Final Version, so we've build it for ourselves and support it too for that purpose, but once you've built an app for 3 people, hundreds is fairly easy. :) If we ever get to thousands, we'd maybe do something, but so far we're not really noticing any costs.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 April 2012 at 20:16 | Steve from Blanc</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Holy poop, dude! I just saved it to the home screen and.... I had no idea you could do this. I knew you could save bookmarks to the home screen, but I didn't realize it would do away with Safari's UI for webapps. Too cool!<br><br>It does take a bit to load every time I pop the list open, however.
