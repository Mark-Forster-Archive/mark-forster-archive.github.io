At the time, all of us in the group were "excited" about the idea of doing it and we all signed up for it. <br><br>As the weeks went by and the date of the jump drew closer, we all started to become more and more anxious about doing it. That's because we started to think about all the things that could go wrong and some of us (not me) dropped out of doing it, but I could still feel the anxiety building day by day up to the moment of the actual jump. But nothing had changed regarding the jump other than the way we were now thinking about it.<br><br>The initial surge of enthusiasm was the excitement but the anxiety came as we imposed our personal "judgements" upon it about what we were doing.<br><br>I believe the author is saying that if you are able to ignore/discount the (negative) judgement aspect that you've introduced to a task, you can then access what the initial true excitement level of the task originally was. <br><br>But you still wouldn't do that task at that moment because it wouldn't feel like the most exciting one to do. Instead, that task has the potential to become the most exciting one if you happen to catch yourself at a time when that judgement has been neutralized, albeit temporarily.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 June 2015 at 8:19 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Frank:<br><br>"I believe the author is saying that if you are able to ignore/discount the (negative) judgement aspect that you've introduced to a task, you can then access what the initial true excitement level of the task originally was."<br><br>Ah, if you put it that way that makes sense, thank you, and I actually believe in that too.  All the talk about vibrations and higher self just made everything hard to read for me.<br><br>The question then is how to remove that "negativity" from a task, which is actually simple in traditional Christianity.  Traditional Christianity's view on controlling one's emotions is that of making "wildlife reserves" in the heart: you let your emotions run wild in certain aspects of your life.  That way, your emotions remain healthy and strong, undiluted as it were, ready to be used on a moment's notice, while keeping them controlled and outside of aspects of your life where they are not needed.  <br><br>That is why the Bible said in multiple places: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." If you keep your fear roaring and wild when it comes to losing the Lord, it keeps itself outside of or at least manageable in other parts of your life.  If you keep at it, wisdom comes out, because fear ceases to cloud your judgment in other parts of your life.<br><br>This is the same reason why traditional Eastern Christianity says, "Anger is for the spirits", which is the same as Western Christianity's "Hate the sin, not the sinner."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 June 2015 at 9:57 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Nico:<br><br>&lt;&lt;  I just cannot see how "exciting" can work for me.

There were no roads and a complete lack of modern conveniences. The inhabitants of the mountain villages were still living the way they'd lived for centuries.

Ask it "Why can I never get ahead?" and it will search its database to find an answer with supporting examples. Never mind that the question is ill-considered and detrimental; I asked it a question, it will provide an answer and not spare my feelings in the process.<br><br>Instead, asking "what's more exciting than x" puts the mind back on my side, I think. It's a more fun question to ask, really. My mind seems to find (maybe even create?) some frisson of excitement/energy/possibility lurking in even mundanely phrased tasks. The excitement may only be "how quickly can I get this done?" but any motivational energy is welcome.<br><br>"What do I want to do more than x" also works for selection but the energy that question evokes is subtler. (Subtler even than the "what stands out" AF question.) But the "what's more exciting" question assumes that first task is *already* exciting, and if my mind accepts that as a starting premise for the question, then it will search out excitement from the rest of my list. It's a great little mood-shifter, I think.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>3 June 2015 at 20:42 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I've been experimenting again!<br><br>This time I've been using FVP with no question at all. <br><br>This is how it works:<br><br>1) Dot the first task on the list, then scan through to the end of the list dotting any tasks that "stand out" on the way.<br><br>2) Work on the last dotted task.

FVP is a bubble sorting algorithm which means the work involved increases as the square of the items.  Running FVP on a 180-item list (I think someone had) will be grossly inefficient compared to running it on a short list due to the sheer number of times an item is compared and has nothing happen to it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>4 June 2015 at 0:03 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>"1) Dot the first task on the list, then scan through to the end of the list dotting any tasks that "stand out" on the way."<br><br>I have worked the list in a similar way, but one problem is the list becomes very messing, and I am not sure of what to do each morning?

I even changed the question with the "exciting" wording. But, after reading Mark's modification, I realized that I I often due this if I don't remember to ask the "question." This may be a system which works if I can figure out the logistics of dotting.

Much easier to have bypassed both of them because neither stand out yet.<br><br>Chris: fine insight about Bubblesorting (though mechanically this is more efficient).

However the bubble sort dynamic, and the n^2 dominance, remains.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>4 June 2015 at 6:08 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>My list seems to have stabilized at about 55 items, which is lower than with other systems - where I have in the past got up to about 120.<br><br>I don't find I have any problem scanning with this. It's fast and effective, especially with the "no question" method. <br><br>I am as always using paper and pen. I can see though that with Andreas' web implementation a major effort is required in order to scan. I didn't pick that up initially because I tested his first version with a short artificial list of about 20 items.

It's not through any conscious attempt to limit it, so the reason must lie within the system itself. <br><br><br>In the meantime a few suggestions/observations:<br><br>1) Have "Weed List" as a task.<br><br>2) I'm still inclining to my second thought that it's best not to re-prioritize the list, but instead to cross out and re-enter individual tasks that have significantly changed priority. I'm finding that works better, and if nothing else it saves making a mess of the dots!<br><br>3) I'm not sure that Chris's assertion that "FVP is a bubble sorting algorithm which means the work involved increases as the square of the items" is correct. It would be correct if the sort were on a closed list, but the list is not closed. The fact is that with an open list a long sort is a relatively rare event. Most of one's time is spent towards the end of the list and that being the case the length of the list is irrelevant most of the time.

Effectively you would be pretending that "there is nothing else on the list I would want to do more than this."  After you complete "this" you of course continue scanning forward as the rules indicate you should. <br><br>Having said that, I agree with Mark's 1,2,3 and don't find any need to try such a tweak.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>4 June 2015 at 13:29 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mathematically it is not the same as a closed list, such as n integers which will always contain quantity n and always be sorted in order through a number of operations until complete.  The FVP list size will change and the value of each item will change with each iteration according to The Question.<br><br>Spending more time near the end of the list does not lessen the exponential effect since any gains made by doing mini sorts near the end are simply postponing the inevitable sorts of the lower ranking tasks.  Either they get done or they get continually sorted down the stack as more amenable tasks are added and sorted up the stack.  In that manner it's marginally worse than a closed list of n integers in terms of work needed, a linear increase on an already exponential burden, not including the logging needed to produce and maintain the list.<br><br>It would be interesting to take a leaf from this well-worn path in computing and apply the FVP philosophy to more efficient non-exponential sorting algorithms and see if a killer system emerges.  Exactly like FVP does now it would still sort tasks according to The Question, since that's its entire purpose, but with reduced algorithmic overhead.<br><br>Some food for thought - <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>4 June 2015 at 21:27 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Chris:<br><br>I'm sure you're right, but since I'm not having any problem with the sort as it is I don't see much point for myself in investing the time necessary to develop a more efficient algorithm. But it would be advantageous for those who are using an app like Andreas's.<br><br>Perhaps you'd like to have a go?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>4 June 2015 at 22:30 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Chris, I thought about this.  The FVP system is a time-optimized selection sort (each loop select the best task; optimized because we don't rescan the entire list every time).  Best-case it's linear time (mark everything in order, do everything reverse order).  Worst case, you scan the whole list but do the first task, scan again, do the second, etc., is quadratic (not exponential) time.<br><br>Most sorting systems are not at all suitable for task selection. The biggest trouble is that they demand going through the whole list over and over putting things in order without actually DOING anything because the goal is an ordered list.  By contrast, the goal here is familiarity with the list and action.  A pre-sorted may not prove as effective as a mixed-up list.<br><br>The common way to make list-sorting more efficient is to divide a list into small chunks and process each separately.  So for example, sort each page separately, then merge those ordered lists.  It's a more efficient way to get everything in order, but a very slow way to start working on something.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>5 June 2015 at 0:57 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I was thinking about this when FVP first came out -- it actually prompted me to read that same Wikipedia article about three times.  I can't say I understood it all -- it's been a decade or two since I've coded sorting algorithms!   LOL<br><br>Alan points out some reasons why exponential time isn't required.  But I think the main reason it's not a full exponential sort is that it's not fully recursive:  you stop once you've identified the top priority item, and don't continue on to get a fully prioritized list.  <br><br>Still, I think it's an open question whether there is a more efficient queuing algorithm for finding the top priority item.  The trick is making it easy and intuitive to maintain on a pad of paper with a list.   That's where Mark's brilliance comes in.   :-)<br><br>Even more interesting, to me at least, is finding an efficient queuing algorithm that doesn't do an exhaustive search for the top-priority item at all, but stops when it identifies something "good enough for action".  In other words, maybe the selected task isn't number 1 on the whole list, but it's got a good probability of being high enough value that it's a better overall value proposition to stop the selection algorithm now and just take action.   That's essentially what Colley's Rule is all about.   I'm wondering if this could give you a higher-value end result, say over the course of a day, with less overhead.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>5 June 2015 at 1:48 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I'm still trying to understand Chris's mathematics because they seem to contradict my own experience of working the list. <br><br>As I understand it he is claiming that in the FVP sort the number of comparisons is the square of the items. This seems to me to be greatly overstating the effort required. <br><br>For instance if we had a list of 10 items this would require 10 squared, i.e. 100 comparisons. But I can't imagine any circumstances in which this would be the case.<br><br>In the best case the list would be already in the correct order. In this case, it would take 9 comparisons using the FVP algorithm to confirm this. All one would do is go down the list dotting every item.<br><br>In the worst case the list would be in reverse order. I reckon this would take 45 comparisons to order correctly. The reason for this is that as each task is identified it is done, thus reducing the number of further comparisons.<br><br>The conclusion is that the nearer the list is to the correct order, the less the number of comparisons required. Now consider the composition of the list. The new, exciting items and the projects which are already under way will tend to congregate towards the end of the list. At the beginning of the list will be the less exciting items and projects which haven't yet got going. In other words the list is already half-way towards being in the correct order.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>5 June 2015 at 2:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I think part of the confusion is that FVP works on a *selection*, not a *sort*.
