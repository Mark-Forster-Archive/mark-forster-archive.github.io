Things are different now:<br><br>1. I am home a LOT more.  This means I will have more time to execute a complete set of tasks.<br>2. These days I am much more confident about what I shall do and what I shan't.  Things will not be on the list that I will struggle mightily to ignore.<br>3. Working from home hours follow the 50/10 pattern.  (great idea, Mark!)  Those 10 minute breaks are great to look at the list and do whatever has been checked last.<br><br>Going with the "stand out" principle for the selection method.<br><br>Thoughts I have that make perfect sense to me, but don't appear in the rules:<br><br>1. Having just selected a bunch of tasks, I have some of them top of mind already.  It's easy enough to just do more than one without returning to the list.<br>2. At the start of the day, it makes sense so you get a full overview of your potential day; but after you have gone through the whole list selecting, and done the last item:<br>- sometimes it will make sense to scan again down according to the rules, and <br>- sometimes it's just easier to do the last task currently selected.  <br>- if you select an item and it's ready to do at this moment, and easy, it doesn't make sense to always scan down for more.<br>- Scan down again when you get to a task that isn't in Yes, Now! mode.<br><br>(These tweaks are personal.  One of my difficulties with all task-execution systems is getting my nose stuck in the system.  I can't comfortably do it for too long at a stretch.)<br><br>Implementation medium:<br>- DynaList, mainly on phone.  <br>- I use "Turn on Checkbox" as my Dot.  <br>- Click the checkbox as my Done. (It autohides).  <br>- Or "Turn off checkbox" and "Move to this list"  (the end of it) to mark as actioned but not done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>5 August 2020 at 14:23 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Awesome Dynalist hint (about the checkbox for "dotting") .  I use Dynalist too.   I tend to use and asterisk * as indicator of a To-Do item because it is more searchable and I often embed to-do's under project notes.   I  can use the "Flat Search" Feature to see the list of only ToDo's but I was struggling to think of how I could dot something beyond doing and asterisk or multiple asterisks.  I think I'll experiment with both the asterisk and the check box together somehow.  I'll have to play with that.<br><br>Brent</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>5 August 2020 at 21:19 | Brent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I suppose another way to 'dot' would be to tag the items with '@fvp' and then click on the tag to show a list of only those tagged items. As you do each one, cross it out or delete it or remove the tag.<br><br>There was a youtube I saw using the Workflowy outliner with FV and that was one of the tricks I picked up.<br><br>It does mean a bit more typing, so, you know.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>6 August 2020 at 14:56 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Recently I moved back to OmniFocus, set it up way too complicated. Now I have a project FVP, I put things in it, then flag them. Easy.<br><br>Most interesting things about using FVP is that usually I am working on Other People's Projects and little things that I would like to get done get lost. Thanks every one for bringing this system back on board.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>6 August 2020 at 19:20 | Erin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mike Brown, I just realized what you mean.  That is extremely useful to be able to tap and only see the selected items!  Then you can have the commited work context and proceed to select more or act.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 August 2020 at 16:23 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>One more dynalist hack: You can save a search in Bookmarks.  So I created a bookmark that is "In FVP, has:checkbox".  So no more need to type or erase tags.  Just mark the items with a checkbox.  Then to see only what's checked click the bookmark!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>17 August 2020 at 18:09 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I'm loving the Dynalist ideas.  <br><br>I'm currently using the color function to "dot the line"   The shortcut is ctrl+shift+L.   The color is a little easier to see than the checkbox.  It is a little too easy for me to gloss over checkboxes in a very long list...<br><br> The search function for colored lines is  "has:color " but I'm not sure how often I'll use that because I want the intuitive portion of this by seeing the whole list. <br><br>I'm really trying to stick with the algorithm to see if I can whittle down my currently enormous list.   I have 130 lines that are a mixture of projects and quick tasks and routine items.  I've never tried one of  the systems on such a large comprehensive list.<br><br>I think once I work on a project sufficiently, I should "un-dot/color it and move it (and it's nested items) to the bottom of the list so that it gets picked up in the algorithm in a fresh way.  <br><br>A short cut for moving a line to the bottom of a list  the move command ctrl+shif+M and select  the same list it is already in (FVP for me) and it moves it to the bottom of the list.<br><br>Brent</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 August 2020 at 22:22 | Brent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Yes that can work too!  BTW there's also a shortcut setting for "Uncolor".<br><br>130 sounds like a lot to start with.  I hope that works out for you!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 August 2020 at 0:19 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Alan:<br><br>"- if you select an item and it's ready to do at this moment, and easy, it doesn't make sense to always scan down for more."<br><br>I encounter this regularly as well when working with FVP. And I sometimes just then do that task, funnily enough, writing this post is one such case.<br><br>But I also feel this might be an error. The scanning makes sense in that it loads one's intuition with fresh information. I find, when scanning the list, my mind gets prompted to "pre-think" on tasks, even if I don't select them for the moment.<br><br>The constant scanning of tasks is like drilling rocks, sometimes you get stuck, but when you continue, finally the breakthrough happens.<br><br>One type of such a breakthrough is that I get psychologically finish to let go of a whole bunch of my "terrific" ideas in one batch.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>5 September 2020 at 3:57 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>By "let go" you mean your ideas weren't all that terrific and you cross them all off the list unactioned?

I do have fewer items then when I started but still over 100<br><br>"drilling rocks"   <br><br>yup, feels like it....<br><br>I think I need to reduce my scope some how.   Not sure how to do that frankly.   It all seems important in its own way. It really depends on the context I'm in.   (but I've never liked David Allen's definition of context as largely location based)   I think at best, it is role based... some roles are being neglected so I'm toying with the idea of having sub lists by role/context.  I think I read somewhere that is a no-no but I'm reconsidering.  I'm not talking about personal vs work here, I'm talking about things like  personnel vs new projects vs operational support.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 September 2020 at 18:30 | Brent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Alan Baljeu<br><br>The method you seem to be using is one I also use and there is a brief discussion of it with Mark in the comments on his "Which is the Best System" blog post.  Mark calls this "Fast FVP" but thinks there might be a better name as it is as much FV as FVP.  As I say in my post there, in general I prefer to proceed using FV which stops me interupting the "doing" but if I'm not ready, for whatever reason, to do the next task I scan down from the one I just completed as in FVP and then continue using FV until the same thing happens again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 October 2020 at 11:37 | Adam T</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
