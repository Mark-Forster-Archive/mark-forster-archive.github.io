SISIN at least lets me "taste" tasks by urgency before committing myself fully.  FV however presents me with too much choice without letting me know whether I DO want to do things in the first place: I am most of the time just guessing what I want to do.<br><br>LOL, it seems, ironically, that FV does not let me want tasks, and SISIN, by removing "want" from the algorithm altogether, does.<br><br>SISIN also gives me less stress.  How? SISIN makes me momentarily forget the tasks I already preselected by combining preselection and doing the preselected in one go.  FV on the other hand has two distinct phases, the preselection and the doing of the chain.  The preselection is no problem, but the doing of the preselected almost gives me headaches because I KNOW what my doing of tasks is leading to is (usually) the most difficult task yet.<br><br>And lastly, SISIN gives me peace of mind.  SISIN has a definite end each day, i.e. it tells me when I have done what I could for today.  FV, however, does not.<br><br>SO goodbye to FV for now.  I don't know if I'm going to pick up FV again, probably when I'm having problems with SISIN (which I doubt), but for now it's back to SISIN for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 March 2012 at 17:28 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>If SISIN works, pursue it with all you've got!

My answer generally came back as one of the following levels of Urgency:  Already, Today, Tomorrow, In a few days, Soon, Later, Doesn't matter, and Never.  Note that these designations were not meant as a hard timeline I intended to follow, but rather a scale to measure how urgent a task felt to me.  As such a "Tomorrow" task could likely stay at that level of urgency for me for weeks before I began to lose interest and it dropped to "Soon," or even "Never."<br><br>I would delete "Never's" and dismiss "Doesn't Matter's," and "Later's" (to be reviewed at a later time).  "Already's" I would work right away until its Urgency dropped to a different level, and the other levels of Urgency I would just select via Colley's Rule (ie: I'd look for the next one with a higher Urgency and do that one). <br><br>SISN seems similar to my "Already" and "Today," but doesn't give you the opportunity to pre-emptively attack something that you'd like to start in the near future.  Also, the question I asked had "Want" in there rather than "Should" but I considering that I generally want to do those things that I should do (because I should do them) I often ended up rating things that I should do as having higher Urgency.<br><br>It worked out rather well for me, though when FV came out I've converted.  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>2 April 2012 at 15:54 | Miracle</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I agree.
