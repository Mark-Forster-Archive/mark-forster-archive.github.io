I think there are a couple of reasons for that:<br><br>(1) Most fundamentally, FVP helps you find the optimum ordering for any list of tasks, as has already been thoroughly discussed.<br><br>(2) You are always completely free to add a task to the end of the list at any time, and thus work on it immediately, all within the ordinary rules of the system.  AF1 and FV especially suffered from the inability to do this without invoking some kind of override (such as "if it needs to be done now, just do it now")<br><br>(3) The system doesn't inflict any mechanical consequences (such as AF1's dismissal, or DIT's "audit of commitments", or DWM's "waterfall deletion").<br><br><br>As such, it's about as close to the "dashboard" concept (as opposed to a "command/control" concept) that Bernie and I (and perhaps others) always wanted to see in a system.

I just add project tasks now in the list (designated as such with prefixes), confident they will be acted upon at the right context and the right order when the time is right.<br><br>&lt;&lt;(2) You are always completely free to add a task to the end of the list at any time, and thus work on it immediately, all within the ordinary rules of the system.

I recall your tastes being fairly different, yet here you are both singing the praises of this amazing panacea.<br><br>Like nuntym, I too quickly ran into resistance in earlier trials of FVP. I will have to try it some more. There are certainly plenty of tips &amp; tricks available now--I could get several weeks of procrastination out of reading them!<br><br>I don't know about that "dashboard." I remember wanting a place to move tasks that were waiting for future attention, and tasks that represented a bigger concept, to get them out of the FVP notebook chaos.<br><br>But there are Seraphim and nuntym's ringing endorsements in black and white, if black and white can ring.

Actually, I can't remember the last time I did a deliberate "weeding".  That just seems to take care of itself when the system takes me back to earlier pages I might not have seen for a few days.   There are usually a bunch of tasks that "stand out" as irrelevant or already completed, so they get deleted immediately.   <br><br><br>&lt;&lt; when I come back the marked items are still relevant &gt;&gt;<br><br>That's usually the case for me, as well, and if they just don't feel like the right thing to do right now, I haven't seen any harm yet in crossing them out and re-entering them at the end of the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>17 August 2015 at 3:11 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Bernie wrote:<br><br>&lt;&lt; panacea &gt;&gt;<br><br><br>I wouldn't call it a panacea.
