It becomes meaningless, and instead I find myself asking "What else do I want to do on this chain?"<br><br>So I've started to switch it up a bit when I find myself going numb like that.<br><br>I try wording the canonical question differently, while retaining the same basic meaning (following Mark's advice, picked up from various forum threads):<br>- What is a higher priority than X?<br>- What is more urgent than X?<br>- What must I do before X?<br>- What else to do before X?<br>- What do I think should be done before x?<br>- What needs to be done first?<br>- What needs to be done more than this, in the near future?<br><br>Sometimes if I feel tired or burdened or the list is just bothering me, I might try an Alt-FV approach, by asking a different question altogether.  Basically, this means thinking about other psychological indicators that might give me a clue about what really needs to be done "before X", and why I am not able to see it clearly:<br>- What am I resisting even more?  (essentially the same as Mark's Alt-FV)<br>- What would I love to do first?<br>- What would I hate to do first?<br>- What would Spouse want me to do first?<br>- What would Boss want me to do first?<br>- What would Mom want me to do first?<br><br>I find I must retain the same question for the whole chain, otherwise it just gets too confusing and generates brain fog.   So I don't recommend jumping between questions.  If you need a new question, just grab the first one that appeals to you or makes sense, and stick with it for at least the duration of one chain, and switch back to the canonical form before trying anything else.<br><br>This usually helps bring the list back to life.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 May 2012 at 1:30 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seprahim, very good...I will try the mom question :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 May 2012 at 7:40 | Nico McDonald</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim, that's refreshing!

One way to do that is to mark out 2 areas or spaces on the floor and get a strong felt and imagined sense of future you energy inhabiting that space and then physically stepping into it and back to current-you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 May 2012 at 22:26 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Watch out, Michael, if you do that too often, you and Future You can switch places and you'll be stuck in an infinite time loop.

Sometimes its driven by time of day or upcoming scheduled events.  Other times I find it's driven by wanting to do things that specifically lead up to the root task.  Most of it isn't well defined, but there often seems to be a theme to a chain.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 May 2012 at 3:54 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>The Ron Paul post was tongue-in-cheek but for me it really does lead to a useful approach.   Think about ANY mentor, your Round Table of personal heroes.  What kind of advice would they give you?

It really is as simple as following the rules as Mark laid them out.  No setting up needed.  Just write down tasks.  You actually can start with just 2.  You probably wouldn't be reading this if you only had two, but in theory you could.<br><br>Make a list of your too many things.  Even better if you already have a list.  Then just mark and do per the rules.  Ignore the rest of what you read here unless you've actually followed the rules for a week or so.  If you have problems, aren't happy with your progress, or have questions, then come back to the forum and look for more info or insight.  Otherwise, just keep doing stuff.<br><br>Ask the right question and don't think too hard when doing it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>24 May 2012 at 4:48 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>dmic - I try to keep it simple and stick with the original question.  If I find myself going "numb" to that question -- I can't answer it -- I can't decide if anything needs to be done before X -- I don't have a good feel for it -- it isn't working -- I feel unfocused and can't break out of it -- then I change the question.   The ones I find most effective personally, are "What would my boss want me to do before X?" (when I am at work)  and  "What would my wife want me to do before X?" (when I am at home).    <br><br>Those questions really bring things into focus and help me prioritize and get moving again:  in other words, they increase my "psychological readiness" and focus it and sharpen it.   <br><br>Once I am moving again, I switch back to the canonical question.   That helps prevent this tweak from becoming complicated, or from becoming a neverending search for the perfect question.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>24 May 2012 at 6:51 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>"What would my Future Self want to do before X?"<br><br>michael essentially said this above, but that is my more concrete version.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>25 May 2012 at 4:16 | Bernie</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
