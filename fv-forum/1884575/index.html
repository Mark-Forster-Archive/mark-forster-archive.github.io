I began doing this when I realized that my list was becoming too cluttered with less than relevant stuff because I generally don't look at my list in terms of relevancy.  Crossing off irrelevant tasks as soon as you come across it is good and all, except I tend to breeze over irrelevant tasks rather than stop, think about them, and judge them as irrelevant.  Therefore, my list became longer and longer, with a huge "dead zone" between the root task and the next task I dotted.  So when relying on the root task to clean up or "dismiss" the older, less relevant tasks doesn't work fast enough for me, I work off a few task chains with this question to pare my list back down to the stuff I actually want to work on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 July 2012 at 15:00 | Miracle</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>It seems that all of these variations can be subsumed into answers to the original question, by adding the clause "because …" to the answers. This works even for Mark's more-resistant variation.<br><br>For example:<br><br>1. I want to do Y before I do X, because I feel more resistance to Y (and feel like challenging myself at the moment).<br><br>2. I want to do Z before I do Y, because I need to get Z done this morning and it's relatively easy and quick to just do it now (and a good start-work warmup before the Y challenge).<br><br>As you can see from these two examples, different reasons may apply on the same chain.  And remember that Mark wrote in the instructions: "There may be a whole variety of reasons why you might want to do one thing before another thing and all of them are valid." So no matter how you rationalize your chain, the act of building it and doing it in order implies that you really want to do Z before Y, and Y before X.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 July 2012 at 18:28 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I previously wrote the question, "What do I want to have begun earlier than x?" as a question that emphasized Urgency, Mark Forster Style.<br><br>I have since experimented a bit with "What am I less comfortable with putting off than x?" and I find that it achieves the same end as the previous question, but it is easier to intuitively "answer" while breezing down the FV list.  <br><br>(ie: you can generally judge the answer to the second question by an already existant "feeling" about each task, compared to the first question where you will occasinoally find yourself "thinking" about the task in question before "deciding" the answer.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 July 2012 at 17:54 | Miracle</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1.What is more rewarding than x?<br><br>2.

Any alternate...is not likely to have the same quality."<br><br>... That's the point — to develop a list of questions that will purposely throw off that balance. "What do I want to do before I do X?" creates balanced preselections. This alternate list of questions is intended to create narrowly-focused preselections balanced sharply in a chosen direction. An alternative to the standard question, not a replacement.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>10 August 2012 at 5:00 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Also, the original question's "want" is very broad. "Want" takes many things into account. Energy level, long-term commitments, the benefit of little-and-often, the need to build habits, the occassional push to finish something faster. It's very easy to forget some of the reasons we might _want_ to do something first. Also, it's easy for something important to slip because we don't ask the question that encourages us to do it.<br><br>Ideally, we remember all the things we need to consider when creating a chain. We want to do things in an order that produces the greatest progress on the most important things. In reality? It's useful to try a new lens every now and then. If the results are the same, great! If not, it means we were forgetting an aspect of the original question.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>10 August 2012 at 18:40 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I think that the ability of the original question (What do I want to do before I do x?) to allow different meanings of the word "want" is really what make it work for me.  When creating the chain, the question can morph into many of the questions that are posed above.  But it really happens subconsciously for me.  Consciously I'm still asking the original question.  Only the specific context of the moment really has changed.<br><br>If I think too hard about it the process gets bogged down.  I don't even think of it as making a chain  I keep in mind what 'x' is and scan my list seeking an answer to the question.  I don't ask it about each and every item.  I'm just searching for the answer.  When I find it, I have a new 'x' which gets marked with a dot and go forward from there seeking the answer to the question.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>11 August 2012 at 3:54 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>MartyH:<br><br>I really like your description. Probably the best one I've read describing what's happening when one asks the standard question. And I like the "I'm just searching for the answer." part. It shows the system can be worked in a relaxing, intuitive way, and is probably how Mark intended it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>11 August 2012 at 4:49 | Michael B.</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
