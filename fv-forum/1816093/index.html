How do the little things take care of themselves?<br><br>I understand the benefit of doing high-resistance stuff first. But, as Mark has always pointed out, the little commitments become big commitments if we don't take care of them.<br><br>So, in normal FV, in one of my chains I will want to check my email and check my inbox. These are not high-resistance tasks, but I want to do them because I need to do them in order to stay on track. If I wait till they bubble up to the root task of my list, it could be a few days. I don't want to go a few days between checking inbox, email, and calendar.<br><br>Maybe I have this all wrong. Maybe if I do the high-resistance tasks first, I will cycle through my entire list a few times a day. Then I don't have to worry about not getting to my email, inbox, or calendar. This seems very unlike to me, however.<br><br>I am clearly missing something here. What is it?<br><br>---------------------<br><br>Revision:<br><br>OK, maybe this is it: after I force myself to tackle the resistant tasks a number of times, they stop being resistant. This is, in fact, my experience with little and often. At some point the letter I need to write to the dishonest vendor loses its resistant quality. Now it becomes a simple matter of printing it, signing it, copying it, addressing the envelope, etc. The resistance has vanished. <br><br>So, the email, inbox, and calendar are no longer low-resistance tasks COMPARED TO the other tasks on my list which have themselves lost almost all their resistance. I no longer need to wait for the routine recurrent tasks to bubble up to the root position, because they have become high-resistance relative to everything else.<br><br>I like this idea. It is now a commonplace in psychology that avoidance increases negative emotions. The best activity is almost always to confront that which I want to avoid.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>5 May 2012 at 23:01 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I read it the same way you did and couldn't figure it out.  Your revision helps it make a little more sense and I can now see the possibility that it could work.  As you indicate, the important part might be the "Compared To" part of the question.<br><br>The way I think it might also work is as an alternative to the normal way of processing the list with FV.  I think that's something Mark envisions when he says that its "for all of us when we have some particularly heavy tasks to get through".<br><br>I doubt we will really know until we try it.  Like so many of Mark's systems, they sometimes sound like they can't possibly work, yet they do.

If you can do that, maybe you don't need help with procrastination!  The "cycling downhill" thing is great, if you can get to the top of the hill, but that may be easier said than done.<br><br>I'm wondering how Alternative FV compares with using Prioritized FV when prioritizing by resistance?

Then you could start with the task you most want to do and benefit from the laddering effect of standard FV, while still applying more focus to resisted tasks...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>17 May 2012 at 20:52 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Hi Deven, <br><br>I would encourage you to try AV FV (or whatever it's called!). It feels both liberating and satisfying to hit the high resistance tasks head on! Or maybe it's just me...<br><br>Remember only *some work* needs to be done on those high resistance tasks and obviously this tends to have the effect of disarming the inherent high level of resistance within. And then one can be rewarding with the first task in the pre-selected chain when it is an easy one. <br><br>I also think Mark is correct when he states that the smaller tasks take care of themselves - at least that's my experience so far.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>17 May 2012 at 21:19 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Alternate FV starts with the hard task, then rewards you with something easy (and guilt-free, since it's still something on the list, unless you write "eat ice cream").<br><br>I tried a few chains of Alt-FV with priorities. It worked very, very well the few times I did it.<br><br>Prioritize the list by priorities, _not_ by resistance. If things are going well, the resistance on the high priority tasks will drop.<br><br>I can see problems doing it for too long, though. Once the resistance is broken on the early (high-priority) jobs, lower-priority jobs with high resistance will have to be dotted -- taking time away from the high-priority ones.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>18 May 2012 at 1:16 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Some responses generally seem to be hypothetical really i.e. not tested out for any length of time.

A question like "what do I want to do before x *or* what am I resisting more than x?" seems like an awful lot of items will get dotted.  I also don't think a 'formal' selection rule about when to use the 'want to do before' vs the 'what am I resisting' question is necessary. <br><br>It seems like it's more of a 'gut reaction' of which question makes the most sense at the time. If that means that 10 chains are the "do before" question before hitting a root task where everything, or anything, can be done before because you really really really don't want to do the root task...that's when to switch to the "resisting more than" question.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 May 2012 at 17:53 | Lillian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I don't think combining them would work, at least not for me.<br><br>"Want to do before" already has many factors. Urgency, pleasure, ease, current energy style, commitments, deadlines, size of project.<br><br>It's nice to break out the factors and concentrate on one at a time sometimes. Assuming you pre-select often enough, I'd even suggest focusing on one or two factors for each chain. Urgency (the one with a long-term view) would need more turns than, say, pleasure or joy at finishing. A cycle that focused on joy at finishing would be a great source of energy.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 May 2012 at 15:45 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mixing the questions doesn't work for me.
