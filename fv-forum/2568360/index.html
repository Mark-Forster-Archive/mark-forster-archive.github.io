I haven't got very far in trying them out yet, so they are totally unproven - but I'm mentioning them in case anyone else wants to try them out at the same time as I do.<br><br>Both improvements are aiming to keep the list both short and relevant:<br><br>1) When a new task is added to the list it is immediately dotted. This means that it is going to be the next task that is worked on. Only one new task can be added at a time.<br><br>2) Tasks can only remain on the list if they are worked on every day. If they are not worked on during a day they are removed from the list and can only get back on the list by being re-entered as a new task as above. This is effected by deleting all tasks at the end of the day still remaining on the list from the previous day. If you prefer to delete the tasks at the beginning of the day, then it's the tasks from two days ago that are deleted. Example: Starting work on Thursday, delete tasks remaining from Tuesday.<br><br>You will of course have to date the start of each day on your list.<br><br>N.B. The removing of tasks which have not been worked on is not intended to be a form of "dismissal". It is simply to ensure that the tasks on the list are live. A task can be reinstated at any time just by working on it again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 January 2016 at 13:22 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Interesting. I think I'll try the second, as I've let things slide and am ashamed to look at my list, which isn't a productive mindset at all.<br><br>The first is also interesting, but one change at a time !<br><br>Rats: It's worse than I thought.

Only if an incomplete task is allowed to lapse does it need to be re-entered as a new task.<br><br>&lt;&lt; By "only one new task can be entered at a time", do you mean that when you've entered a new task and gone back to work on your current task, you then cannot add any more new tasks until you have done work on the new task? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes. When you add a new task it is the next task you work on. You can't either add another new task or work on any other task (except the one you are currently working on) until you have done some work on it. In fact I usually don't add a new task until I am in-between tasks, so I just add the new task, dot it and start working on it straight away.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 January 2016 at 15:39 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Will:<br><br>&lt;&lt; The first is also interesting, but one change at a time ! &gt;&gt;<br><br>They are designed to work together, so only doing one may not have the desired effect.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 January 2016 at 15:46 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark<br><br>So you wouldn't use the FVP list for universal capture? Very often I'm working on a task and something either occurs to me that needs action or somebody interrupts me. I normally note the resulting task or action at the end of the list and continue with what I was doing. Would you rely on memory to add the task or jot a quick note somewhere else?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 January 2016 at 16:40 | Caibre65</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Caibre65:<br><br>&lt;&lt; So you wouldn't use the FVP list for universal capture? &gt;&gt;<br><br>No, the whole ideas of these modifications is to make the list represent what you are actually working on in the present - rather than be a compendium of everything you might or might not do in the future.<br><br>&lt;&lt; Would you rely on memory to add the task or jot a quick note somewhere else? &gt;&gt;<br><br>I'd probably make a note of it with the date I want to add it to the list.

Basically there are two ways:<br><br>1) Use your existing list. At the end of Day 1, everything you haven't taken some action on that day will be deleted - though if you started late on Day 1 I'd leave the mass deletion until the end of Day 2.<br><br>OR<br><br>2) Build up the list from scratch, which is what I have done. Every task I have on my list has been worked on today by definition. At the end of tomorrow I will delete any of them which I haven't worked on tomorrow as well.<br><br>The end result of both is the same, so pick whichever one suits you best.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 January 2016 at 17:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>At the end of my first day trying this out, I feel that I had a very focused day in which I got a lot done. <br><br>My list as it will be carried forward to tomorrow is 30 tasks long, all of which by definition have been worked on at least once during the day. I also did another 7 tasks which I have finished completely - so they don't feature on the list any more. All in all I have used 97 lines in my task book today.<br><br>The big test of course comes tomorrow when I see how many of these tasks will survive another day and how many new tasks will join the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 January 2016 at 23:10 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark:<br><br>How would you approach this scenario:<br><br>Frequently, in the middle of completing a task you think of many new tasks that are best started today. You write each one down at the end of your list, add a dot in front of each, and proceed working on the current task. When finished, you scan down the list and dot a few tasks that need doing next, but find there are 7 new tasks dotted ahead of them all the way to the end of the list. <br><br>What are some good ways to approach this?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 January 2016 at 1:14 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark:<br><br>Ha. I missed this bit, "Only one new task can be added at a time."

In fact it's exactly how I built my list of 37 tasks from scratch yesterday.<br><br>Just add them one at a time throughout the day. Jot them down on a separate bit of paper if you must, but it's best to rely on your mind's answer to the question "What do I want to do now more than x" (or whatever question you are using).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 January 2016 at 8:33 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Michael,<br><br>I suspect that a lifetime of being Mick Cool has left Mark with a slightly skewed view of just how easily we Joe Slobs can lose track of what we should be doing. But writing ideas down on a separate sheet (or in the task breakdown lists) seems fine.<br><br>Or you could: <br>1. accept that your focus has wavered for long enough to have the idea, <br>2. strike through and re-enter the current task, <br>3. add the idea on your list (dotted, of course) <br>4. define what you are actually going to do with the idea<br>5. this counts as doing something, so strike through and reenter your new idea<br>6. get back on task<br><br>It sounds ridiculous written down, but this is what you are actually doing mentally if you capture ideas during a task.

But the problem as raised by Michael wasn't about one idea but about many (specifically 7). If you're going to enter seven new tasks without really doing anything about any of them, then what you are doing is normal FVP - and it would be better just to acknowledge that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 January 2016 at 10:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Sadly, I've already given up on this.

Quickly cracks away at resisted tasks and gets them finished sooner. This may keep the list more trim.

I'm starting same-day resisted tasks earlier in the day.<br><br>2. I resist a lot of new tasks and tend to think them up rapid-fire, one after another, so a lot of new tasks are being dotted and forming resistant groups (sounds like battle!).<br><br>3. I'm finding these resistant blockades interfere with the sequencing of earlier dotted tasks that have newly become urgent. Usually those earlier tasks are small but necessary daily recurring tasks. So while these smaller tasks are not exactly trivia, I have felt a bigger sense of accomplishment starting the resistant tasks, but at the expense of the smaller tasks not always being done in an optimal sequence. If it occurs to me to start one of these earlier dotted tasks, I simply write them at the end of the list with a dot and work on them next, but I can see how I could forget about them as my list grows longer.<br><br>4. I'm finding that these groups of resistant tasks are encouraging me to plow through them quickly using the little and often principle so I can get to the non-resistant tasks dotted earlier in the chain.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 January 2016 at 22:01 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Michael:<br><br>Did you start a new list from scratch or apply the new rules to your old list?<br><br>I started a list from scratch, so every task on it had been worked on at least once the first day. But I didn't find that that meant that I wasn't resisting the more difficult tasks the following day.<br><br>In other words the first day was absolutely fine, but the second day was a big disappointment. I didn't get as far as the end of the day, but if I had I would have had to delete just about every non-trivial project I have.<br><br>Of course it's just occurred to me that I could then have reintroduced them the following day, so they would at least get worked on every other day!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>17 January 2016 at 0:26 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark:<br><br>Kind of both.

This would give me free weekends, but may reduce the momentum too much during the week. An alternative would be to let the window slide over the weekend. I.e. 1 day Monday through Friday, Saturday don't dismiss Friday, Sunday, don't dismiss Saturday or Friday, Monday dismiss Thursday.<br>• Have a Kanban of various commitments to feed the system with.

Looking at my posts and your feedback, it's pretty clear that I was treating the not carry forward as a type of dismissal, up to and including a 'be careful not to re-enter blindly'.<br><br>From now on, I'll look at the carried-forward list simply as "what I worked on yesterday" when I open the list up in the morning. Even now, this takes a lot of the pressure off and it would make perfect sense for me not to work on certain projects during the weekend.<br><br>Thanks again!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>26 January 2016 at 22:02 | Ryan Freckleton</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1. Yeah, I love this. I love adding dotted, and I love adding undotted.<br>2. This, though, is not for me. I tend to use little-and-often sparingly. It's a great tool for the very worst tasks, with the very worst resistance, but it does tend to add overhead (the fewer times I have to take everything out relating to a project and put everything away, the less overhead). I'd rather something be untouched on the list for a while then completed in one fell swoop. Again, some things are so arduous that little-and-often is psychologically or practically necessary for them. But not everything. I found that I had a tendency to do little-and-often too much, and that ate up a lot of my time and motivation because nothing got completed.<br><br>That said, I do love a short list. I've got a script set up to automatically add things to the list at future dates so I can postpone things I'm not able to work on now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2016 at 10:55 | Sandra S</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
