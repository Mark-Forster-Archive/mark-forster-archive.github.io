It's basically my FVP "current initiative hack" with a couple additions.<br><br>This post assumes you are familiar with FVP and Fast FVP. <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/1/6/fast-fvp-an-example.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/1/6/fast-fvp-an-example.html</a> <br><br>Start with FVP using the Current Initiative Hack. <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2560976">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2560976</a> <br><br>And then here are the additions:<br><br>Use the "Fast FVP" rule: after you dot something, ask, "Am I ready to do this NOW?" If yes, do it. Otherwise, keep scanning. Use the same rule when scanning for strategic items (current initiatives, marked with a cross). Sometimes they are small and can be done immediately.<br><br>"NO-LIST MODE": When returning from a long break (long enough where you have been disengaged from the list long enough that you can't remember exactly what you were last doing), draw a line at the end of the list, and pause for a moment to collect your thoughts. Write them all down. Scan from the line, and see if anything stands out. Dot it. Then proceed from there as usual (with the FVP algorithm). You might stay in no-list mode for a while (i.e., working below the line, on whatever is most top-of-mind). This is fine. Eventually, just following the normal algorithm, you will work your way back above the line into your current-initiative space. In this way, the system eventually prompts you to get refocused on your current initiative. When I do reach my last item marked with a cross, I often find it is already completed! <br><br>Use a strategic question for finding current initiatives (e.g., "What will have more impact than X?"). For finding tasks (dots), use a tactical question that helps you finish the current initiatives (e.g., "What will help me finish the current initiative more than X?").<br><br>If you are feeling especially overwhelmed, overloaded, unfocused, scattered, etc. -- it can be very helpful to change over to problem-solving mode, rather than get-stuff-done mode. It is easy to do this. Just change the set of questions. For the strategic question, I like "What is bothering me more than X?" And for the tactical question, I like "What is more of a contributing factor to this problem than X?" This is reminiscent of my problem-solving method: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2638237">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2638237</a><br><br><br>For NO-LIST MODE, I tried using some alternative no-list methods instead of the one I describe above. And they also seem to work just fine. Next-Hour, No-List FVP, etc. I am not sure how the mechanics would work with the broad variety of no-list methods. But these ones worked just fine, and also naturally transitioned into current-initiative mode when nothing else stood out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 January 2017 at 21:58 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Alan - regarding your question about the mental burden. It does require more mental engagement when answering the strategic question. But when working the tactical question, in practice I find myself asking the question once, at the beginning of the scan, and then just going with whatever stands out. <br><br>In other words, it usually just flows along with the standing out mechanism, but pulls you into a more deliberate thought process when necessary.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 January 2017 at 22:14 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim, Everything I find online about TOC seems to apply to manufacturing, especially mass-production, with buffers and aggregation points.<br><br>Is there a site that describes it for time management?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>6 March 2017 at 19:22 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Cricket - I don't know if anyone has made a serious effort to apply the TOC concepts to time management before. I've seen one or two articles on it, but they seemed superficial and/or impractical.<br><br>Probably the best resource that discusses the general applicability of TOC (far) beyond manufacturing is the book The Choice by Eli Goldratt.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 March 2017 at 16:33 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>More generally, I've often thought the field of personal productivity should borrow more than it does from manufacturing productivity methodologies. One example that has crossed the barrier is Kanban. I've tried using 5S principles to develop a system. A lot more could be done with the various lean manufacturing / six sigma / etc. stuff.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 March 2017 at 23:06 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>There are some good books, such as Dan Markovitz's A Factory of One.

I've actually spent some time making a little computer language to help me do the graphics and have started implementing those for my projects when needed.<br><br>I find it interesting that the TOC separation into:<br><br>What (is the current state of things)?<br>(I want to change the state) to What?<br>How?<br><br>seems to be the same as Mark's method for approaching goals. The current reality tree also reminds me of an 'engineer version' of the current reality from Dreams, similarly for the FRT and Future Vision.<br><br>This is really exciting!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>26 March 2017 at 4:52 | Ryan Freckleton</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Ryan, thanks for making that connection!

That is a remarkable stretch of continuity.<br><br>I observe that you have a FVP mode and a no-list mode.  And my most recent success, <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2696352,">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2696352,</a> also has a switch (between simple scanning and no-list).  <br><br>I could also see myself adapting Mark's newest variant, Changes to Fast FVP (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2018/1/6/change-to-fast-fvp.html),">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2018/1/6/change-to-fast-fvp.html),</a> while keeping the no-list bailout.  Or possibly even adapting this process here.<br><br>It's a funny thing how at one point a process seems interesting but you can't see applying it, but later it seems exactly right, and all that's changed is how you think about things.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>23 January 2018 at 13:18 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Alan - yes, this is probably my main fallback system -- no-list as the appendage to an FFVP list with some focusing tools built in when I need them. And sometimes I include some random selection to keep it interesting.<br><br>But most days I don't even look at my list -- and I feel like I am getting the right things done. I guess I should clarify...<br><br>I think one of the key things I've learned from Mark's systems -- beginning with my struggles to use AF1's "dismissal" effectively -- is that the ordering and tracking of things at the task level is mostly on the order of "chupchiki". <br><br>&lt;&lt; Chupchik is a slang word in Hebrew that describes a situation where a person is busily working on something which does not count much. Or more vividly: "Pissing in the wind and feeling very proud about it". &gt;&gt; -- <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.toc-goldratt.com/index.php?cont=784">http://www.toc-goldratt.com/index.php?cont=784</a><br><br>Note that I said "mostly". :-)<br><br>When I approach time management tools as *thinking tools* and *focusing tools* -- I get much better results than when I use them to guide my every action throughout the day.<br><br>And when I use them as thinking and focusing tools, the little things are still important but tend to take care of themselves. I don't need to be reminded so much of the things that will assert their importance all by themselves, or the things that are part of my daily routine. So I usually don't put them on my list, unless they are creating pressure somehow, invading my mental space. Then they go on my list so I can sort it out.<br><br>If I go through a whole day without looking at my list, and feel like I got the right things done, that seems like a pretty good day. Most days are like that. Most days I feel like I got so much done I can't even remember it all, some of it feels like it got done several days ago, and I just feel tired and happy. Most of the time. To me, this seems like a pretty good outcome.<br><br>If it's a hectic day, pulled in many directions, many details to keep track of -- then it all goes on the list, and I work the list using FFVP or no-list or a combination as described at the top of this thread -- until I get back into my focus and don't need the list anymore.<br><br>I think another big change here -- my goal is NOT to complete all the stuff on my list. That always used to be an implicit goal -- either to do it all, or consciously decide to not do it. To get closure. To consciously decide -- or perhaps to let the decision emerge through the standing out process. But still, to *get closure*.<br><br>Nowadays I am not really sure there's a lot of value to that sense of closure. That demand for closure transforms the list from a thinking tool into a burden of debt. <br><br>I don't need that mental burden.<br><br>This is all quite a change from the days when I would run up any new list to over 1000 items within a week of starting it... I have a lot of lists like that still sitting around. The fact that they are still sitting around, but my work is getting done, I feel I am getting better at staying on top of work and family and personal commitments, I am getting results I am generally happy with, and I see a lot of personal growth and improvement -- shows that all those lists don't matter so much. What matters most is how the tools and systems help clarify focus. <br><br>Mark's systems do that really, really well. <br><br>But one potential inherent problem with all task-based time-management systems is they draw our attention continually back to the task level. They don't NEED to operate this way, but I think they TEND to operate that way. Using these systems as thinking/focusing tools helps me not to lose the forest for the trees.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>26 January 2018 at 20:53 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Starting a new complicated project at work, and I found the number of tasks starting to grow past comfort level.  Most of these are not 2 minute things like you might see at home.  2 hour seems more likely.  What I'm thinking at the moment is to chunk these up.  Many many of the items in OneNote are about the same thing, so if I group all those things together and just have a link to them in my task list, the list becomes much shorter, and the items that remain are not often Tasks any more but more Aspects of the project I need to spend time on.
