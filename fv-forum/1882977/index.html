If, at the moment, I found that I had the courage to do so, I would refuse to consent to participate, regardless of the consequences, on the principle of the thing.<br><br>If, under duress, I found that I could not resist participation, then I'd choose whatever system was appropriate to my totalitarian environment.  Based on the written Gulag experiences of people like Aleksander Solzhenitsyn, Fr Arseny Streltzov, Richard Wurmbrand, and so many others, I'd guess an urgency-based response system would be most appropriate.   If I remember correctly, AF2 worked pretty well under those circumstances.  So I'd choose AF2.<br><br>This would all fall apart if the guards took away my pen and notebook, however, as they most likely would do.   I guess I'd have to keep the list in my head.   Does that still count?<br><br>The most intriguing thing would be that a totalitarian regime has people in authority who read Mark's website.  Thus, presumably, Mark would have been able to escape the Gulag himself and worked his way into a position of influence.   Thus, I would have hope that Mark is still using Final Version in a secret attempt to free us all from the Gulag and overthrow the totalitarian regime.   That task, "Take over the world", has always appeared on Mark's example task lists, so perhaps Mark is already laying the groundwork for such a contingency.  Thus, we could probably rest assured that we would not be required to use the system for an entire year -- Mark would get us out before then.   This makes my selection of AF2 all the more bearable.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 July 2012 at 17:24 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim:<br><br>That is an acceptable answer.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 July 2012 at 17:43 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim:<br><br>Personally, I would hope that Mark had all along presumed these events to unfold and had intended that the acronyms to his systems be combined into a long string to be entered into an alpha-numeric keypad at a high-security checkpoint out of the facility.

I particularly like the idea of spending a concentrated period of time wrestling only unfinished tasks to the ground.  I'm considering integrating this into FV by marking my unfinished tasks on my FV list (ala DWM2) and creating at least one pre-selected task chain a day in which I consider ONLY the tasks that I've marked as unfinished.<br><br>But may I ask why you would give such endorsement to AF4R?

Which is exactly the one I've been eyeing.  <br><br>Not wanting to stray from FV which has worked better for me than any other system I've ever tried, I've decided I will in fact give my tweak a 2 week test run:<br><br>1) Mark unfinished tasks on my FV list with a circle in the margin, where I usually put the dots for preselection.  I'll use a circle so I can still put a dot in the middle of the circle to preselect that task.<br><br>2) For the first preseltion of every day, consider only tasks with circles in the margin.  (ie:  first dot the oldest open unfinished task as the root task, and ask "the question" of the following unfinished tasks only).<br><br>3) For all subsequent preselections that day, proceed as normal FV.  (ie:  first dot the oldest open task on the whole list, and ask "the question" of all following tasks, both untouched and unfinished).<br><br>Ha.
