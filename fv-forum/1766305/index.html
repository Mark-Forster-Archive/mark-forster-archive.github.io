That had been working before. I would just get clarity when I came to it. <br><br>But I didn't. Working through the current chain it quickly became the next dot, but instead of doing it I got "busy" with other things - a couple other easy ones I could do, a little Internet surfing, roaming through email, working on some latest and loudest that had trickled in. I would sense I had gotten off-track, go look at my list again, see that item and subconsciously think "ugh" and then look away and get busy on something else. <br><br>What to do? Redefine? Split into smaller pieces? Pick one teeny tiny thing I can do to unblock it and cross it off? The latter is where I'm seeking help. <br><br>I just didn't have the energy to do a big "Project Think" about it. I also don't think the "set a timer and work for 5 minutes" technique would do it. I could feel it was the very idea of initial engagement at any level that I was fighting. <br><br>In these situations, once I actually do something - ANYTHING - no matter how tiny, I cross some invisible barrier and then the item turns back into a normal task. But before that, it's a two-headed monster playing a game of "who blinks first", and that keeps growing new heads with every pass where I blink, lose, and look away. It eventually morphs into a Medusa, where I can't even look. <br><br>I want to follow the process, and I know there are other dots in the chain, but I'm unwilling to skip a dot. Skip one, and the whole thing falls apart. You might as well do them in any order at that point, and skip the dots altogether. <br><br>Any thoughts what to do in a situation like this? I suspect it's a simple and clever hack of the "little and often" principle. Help!<br><br>[Cross it out and put it at the end of the list.

Sit calmly and take a few deep breaths.<br>4. Start a two-minute timer.<br>5. Think about the task and what you might do about it.<br>6. Write any related thoughts that come to mind.<br>7.

LOTS of great ideas here. I knew you all would be able to help. :) Plus, I think many struggle with this, but for different reasons. Your variety of simple starting points should address a wide range of Medusas for others. <br><br>My favorite for me: My interpretation of Alan's suggestion to change the task to "define the very next action", but then don't do that action. Just write it on the end of the list, and then next round, the resistance will be gone. <br><br>BONUS: I'm willing to bet that more often than not, just by taking off the pressure to actually DO something, I will actually do the thinking, define the very next action, and then actually do it right then anyway. The resistance is more in the undefined monster I can't really see (the monster in the dark is always scarier). <br><br>Mark asked an interesting question: was the task an old task with resistance that came with it, or was it a new task that grew resistance within FV?<br><br>Here's the task: "call Lena re: box labels, truck request, Summit entry, and overs"<br><br>The short answer is that the task was added to FV with a whole heap of pre-existing resistance, with the blind hope that FV would somehow magically sort it out for me. FV did NOT create the resistance. It just made it very clear that something was somehow wrong with the task as written. <br><br>The long answer, upon reflection, was that 1) this was a new vendor who didn't know our processes, and 2) that I hadn't had to teach a vendor in a long time, and 3) our IT department archives all emails that are older than a year so 4) my well-crafted explanations were gone from my email folders, meaning 5) I would have to recreate them, even though I was not the one most familiar with them because it was my existing vendors who actually did them regularly. <br><br>Also, it had four parts listed. The first part involved finding an email listing all the PO numbers I had previously requested and detailing out the contents of each label. The second part involved finding a previous truck request email, then stripping out the vendor-specific information and forwarding it to Lena. The third part involved finding a Powerpoint instruction manual on another department's server for an online process that had been updated since the last manual. The last part involved a conversation about what to do with the extras we had printed, since we were in the middle of a major transition with our warehouse. <br><br>Medusa, indeed!<br><br>With my current vendors, the task would have read "RW$ shipping paperwork", and there would have been no more than the typical resistance of any other item.<br><br>Following Alan's suggestion, I thought about the very next action. It was "Call Lena and let her know she will need to add custom labels to the boxes." <br><br>And then, as predicted, the veil lifted, I actually called Lena right then, and took care of the box labels and truck request while she was on the phone. We also cleared up the next steps for the Summit entry and Overs. Those were added to the end of the list, and I finished up the current chain. Medusa was beheaded, and I went home with a smile.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>23 March 2012 at 14:54 | scottmoehring</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Actually, another way to attack a high-resistance task would be another of Mark's journaling exercises, namely the Future Reality/Current Reality exercise. Write down what the future looks like and feels like with this task accomplished, then note the current reality with all the feelings attached to it. Then the next task on the FV list could be "Update FR/CR on resistant task". Just another thought to go with the others in this thread.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>23 March 2012 at 15:30 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>People have suggested 30-minute timers, 5-minute timers, 2-minute timers ... Horrendous aeons ... I keep my wristwatch countdown timer set at 1 minute.
