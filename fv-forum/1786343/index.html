If it's only 1 or 2 things that must be done today it seems to do well but when I have 7 or 8 things, it just doesn't work well for me. Am I the only one? Anyone have any tweaks that are helping with this?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>12 April 2012 at 16:00 | Jim Dandy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I use AF just for those 7 or 8 tasks. Otherwise all 7 or 8 gets dotted which isn't as helpful! :) Once I've got those done, or as done as they can be while I'm waiting for someone else to do their piece, then I go back to FV for other tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>12 April 2012 at 17:55 | Lillian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I usually work in two modes, alternating between them as convenient during the day - first is Final Version mode (with separated lists for home and work), second is "planned for today" (today tasks, appointments etc.) I try to minimize number of today tasks (and put as much as possible into FV), but when something needs to be done today, it goes to specific "today" list. During the day, I use either this list (ordered by importance, or by best sequence, or by specific day times)+calendar or FV lists. Sometimes (when I do not have so many today tasks) I combine those two by adding today tasks into FV list plus starring them (I also star other very importang/urgent tasks) - just for visual distinction. I try to complete these (or to do at least something on) all starred tasks during the day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>12 April 2012 at 19:04 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Hmm, this really hasn't been a problem for me.  At least, it hasn't required any tweaks.  <br><br>If something new comes up, I add it to the end of the list and dot it.<br><br>If there are 7 or 8 things that must be done today, then I start the day by clearing all existing dots, and scanning through the list for these particular items.  Or if they are already on my mind, I just write them at the end of the list and give them a dot.   <br><br>This is all fully within the rules.   (1) You can erase all the dots if the current selection has gone bad.   (2) Each one of these urgent items screams at me, "Yes, do me before X!", so I'm not breaking the selection criterion.<br><br>I suppose this could break down if you have 7 or 8 things that must be done urgently today, but you aren't actually aware of that fact when you start the day.    If that kind of thing happens to you, I'd suggest establishing the habit of clearing all your dots and doing a full scan, every day at the beginning of the day.   This is also fully within the rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>12 April 2012 at 23:39 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I've had some pretty hairy days when I needed to do some urgent things and FV has held up remarkable well. Four things come to mind.  <br><br>1.  First, working the system now for several weeks has really helped me stay on top of things so the urgent things aren't taking over. <br><br>2.  Secondly, related to this, I find the core question is really important and I need to remind myself of it from time to time:  "What do I really want to do before I do x?" is important for prioritizing properly.   I think the habit of just marking stuff off because I feel like doing them is a bad habit held over from AF days (even though it worked for AF).  The real question is slightly different - not "what do I feel like doing" but "what do I want to do before I do x." (is it "want" or "need?"  I forget from the instructions.) <br><br>3.  Thirdly, I have no qualms about just doing the urgent thing when I need to regardless of the list, if I need to do it.  I'm not obsessive compulsive about the list.  Although, there's also nothing wrong with writing the urgent item at the end of my list and putting a dot on it and just starting the chain over again.  Then once that item is finished I'm right back where I left off, but I think sometimes you have to do the smart thing and just do what needs to be done at that time.   <br><br>4.  Fourthly, when my life starts to get busy with lots of stuff and I can feel "hairiness" coming on, I start keeping my chains shorter.  "What do I need to do before I do item 1?"  "Well, I really need to get item 4 done, but I better leave it at that, because more stuff keeps coming in that might be more important."  It's like I say to myself "i don't want to get in a situation where I have a dozen things to do before I get back to the end of the list because lots more stuff is going to get added that I might need to do." So I just plan on two or three things before recreating a new chain.  Then, the odd time I'll have a pretty free day and just knock of a whole bunch of stuff with a chain of 12 or 15 items.  Feels great, too!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 April 2012 at 3:12 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I sometimes highlight (green dot) urgent tasks -- not to give them extra attention, but to make sure I actually see them rather than skip over them when making a chain. Either way primes my brain, so it considers them urgent. After a month of putting off "get son's birthday gift," it takes a bit of a kick for my brain to actually see it and think "Hey! That's next week!" Copying the urgent tasks to the last page of FV also works -- the last page then looks very similar to a "do today" list, but I still work it as part of the big FV list.<br><br>Another benefit is I get a feel for the coming day. Like Paul finds, on busy days I only want to do urgent things. Unfortunately, in the morning I sometimes need that extra step to realize that it is a busy day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 April 2012 at 13:37 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I write due dates somewhere on the line and draw a box around them. They stand out really nicely. I sometimes write start dates or relevant/time-window dates with a circle around them. But only for tasks coming up within the week. Further out, they go on the calendar or tickler file.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 April 2012 at 8:03 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>When urgency kicks in, I redefine what 'want' means to me. Usually in urgent mode, I just want to get out of it. So at that time, urgent and want become synonymous temporarily until I regain control and alleviate the pressure imposed by time available.&nbsp;<br><br>When I form my ladders, I ask 'what do I want to do before x?' which really means something like: what is more urgent than x? I then rush through it. &nbsp;I used to be against rushing things rather than taje my time but I have realized that I am surprisingly pretty good at it and the results I produce aren't as bad as I assume they would be.&nbsp;<br><br>Also similar to Lillian , there are times i just extract those urgent items onto a different list, break them into equal divisions/parts using lines, then unleash some Autofocus on it until happy.&nbsp;</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 April 2012 at 19:54 | GMBW</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Like Bernie, I include due dates when I write out the task.   That helps a lot.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 April 2012 at 1:39 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
