The 'want to do before x' stage is actually resulting me in doing more important stuff.<br><br>As my FVP is electronic (using Todoist), I am able to allocate Work List tasks selected during the algorithm process to a 'Work Chain' label (I use 'Personal Chain' when working my Personal List).<br><br>Then by clicking on the label, I see only those tasks selected, which removes the distraction from having the whole list before me.<br><br>I understand the FVP process as (1) that if one works on, but does NOT complete a task, one adds it to the bottom of the list, the one with everything on it, and (2) that if one thinks of something else, one also adds that to the end of the list.<br><br>IF I do not complete a task during working a chain, I do not see any reason why I cannot add it back to the chain immediately (even it if it is 'below' the next chain task working upwards), instead of to the main list(s).  I am not compelled to do either, but if that worked, but unfinished task is pretty important to me (a 'want' rather than something 'exciting', although the task could rate the same!), then I'd like to tackle it while in the current chain flow.<br><br>This could mean a chain takes longer than first thought, but if I am in the groove, why not?<br><br>A disadvantage could be that I may ignore the main list for some time.  But I can always put in a date/time reminder in Todoist that will bring it to my attention before it loses any 'value'.<br><br>Any thoughts, anyone?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 June 2015 at 9:56 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I might be wrong, but the workflow you describe sound likes FV, not FVP - mainly the "'want to do before x' stage" and you mentioning working the chain without returning to the main list.<br><br>In FVP, when you complete a task, you go back to the selected task before it, and then compare it with all (unselected) tasks in the list after the task you just completed. So working the chain in FVP is not possible without looking at the main list.<br><br>Besides that, in both FV and FVP, you never have tasks that are selected below the one you are currently working on. This makes in clear in which direction to proceed after completing the task. Once you have tasks on both sides, you introduce choice. That might work out, but at that point you've stopped using the principles behind FV/FVP.<br><br>This is of course all in IMHO, I might have misunderstood something.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 June 2015 at 10:30 | Andreas Maurer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Points taken, Andreas, maybe I have completed more important tasks because<br>of the chain.<br><br>Surely there is always a choice, even if it is just distinguishing between<br>the next selected task above the one just completed and all those below<br>what you have just done.<br><br>No wonder Mark stated you may NEVER reach that first, oldest task, unless<br>you work at it piecemeal.<br><br>Maybe my advancing years are kicking in at 68 next month, but as i am<br>working for at least another two years, I must persevere.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 June 2015 at 10:43 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Roger J:<br><br>"The 'want to do before x' stage is actually resulting me in doing more important stuff."<br><br>Mark did say you can use the FV question in FVP and it would still work, if you prefer that algorithm question.  <br><br>"IF I do not complete a task during working a chain, I do not see any reason why I cannot add it back to the chain immediately (even it if it is 'below' the next chain task working upwards), instead of to the main list(s).

Although if you add it to the chain you have to do it immediately since it would be the "first" one in your chain list now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 June 2015 at 11:02 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Andreas,<br><br>Assuming my implementation of FVP has been faulty, I can still use Todoist when I have finished (or worked on it for enough time/progress for now) the task in the chain.<br><br>(1) I copy the text of the just-completed task using Ctrl+C.<br><br>(2) I tick off the task in the chain view as done which removes it.<br><br>(3) I add a new task on the main list and paste in the text per (1) above using Ctrl+V.<br><br>(4) I then scan the main list down from the next selected UNDONE task and apply the algorithm as i go through to the end of the list.<br><br>(5) I select the  'want' task or tasks, or 'exciting' if you prefer, and apply the label for the chain and go back to the chain view and start working from the last one upwards.<br><br>(6) Rinse and repeat as necessary.<br><br>It may seem a bit long-winded, but it is quick in Todoist, plus I also get 'karma' points in Todoist (and my points rate has increased since I started working in FVP or similar over the last 10 days or so).<br><br>If this does not pan out well enough, I can always use the labels just to tag tasks as selected  and work off the main list instead of just the chain view.  A partly completed task can have its label removed and dragged to the bottom of the main list.<br><br>BTW, is your own app available across Windows and Android?

While it does work in Chrome/Windows (which I use at work) and should work on Android (I only use it on iPad for my personal list), these would be separate lists with no syncing, so probably of little use in your case.<br><br>I also want to say again that if I state any deviations from Mark's instructions I perceive in your workflow, I don't mean to say that what you're doing is wrong or faulty.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 June 2015 at 12:49 | Andreas Maurer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Andreas: no problem, I envy you the ability to create something that is customised for FV, FVP or other MF creation.  <br>I have been around the task list and productivity trail seeking nirvana for more years than I care to remember.  <br>Hell, I even remember the advent of the concept known as MBO, plus it is over 30 years since I first used an IBM PC, no HDD, 640k RAM, DOS 2.x, green yexy screen, 2 floppy DDs, I felt so liberated at work back then.<br><br>@Mark: thanks for the encouragement about life in the eighth decade.  Cynic that I am, I sometimes quote, "Cheer up, things could be worse.  So I cheered up and, sure enough, things got worse." to anyone who might be available.  But I can be very stubborn.<br><br>I do accept that languished tasks can be dismissed, hibernated or join others in my LTBW (Let The Barsteward Wait) folder to await a purge.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 June 2015 at 14:06 | Roger J</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
