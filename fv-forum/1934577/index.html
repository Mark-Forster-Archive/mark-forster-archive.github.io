Ha.

However, if your list stays the same for a while, as in the example above, you'll need to work on "project x" (or whatever that task may be) again at the end of your next chain. That's actually a great "push-to-finish" feature, but the flaw is when you encounter a recurring task like "shower". You'll be having a shower at the end of every chain until you add a new task!

If you're working on a chain and five new urgent tasks are assigned to you by your boss, and they can wait until you've finished with your current task, but they cannot wait until you finish your current chain; how are you adding these tasks to your current chain? <br><br>This is a common occurrence; as new tasks come in, some need doing next, and often more than one, one after the other, but before the next items in your current chain.

No. The beginning of your chain is in the middle of your list, so the new dotted task is at the end of your chain. His tweak involves creating chains in reverse from the end of the list and working them forward towards the end of the list. <br><br>Adding a series of new urgent tasks throughout the day to the end of your list and dotting them to be worked on next will inevitably lead to confusion as you ping-pong between working your chain forward from the middle towards the end and working your new urgent tasks in reverse towards the middle or perhaps working your new urgent tasks forward towards the middle from the oldest new urgent task now 2/3 of the way into your list before returning to the beginning in the middle!
