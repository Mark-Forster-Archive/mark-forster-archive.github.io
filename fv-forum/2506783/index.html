Once you added a few tasks, you only ever see one of two screens:<br><br>1) A choice between two tasks<br>2) The task you should do now<br><br>== Data Security ==<br><br>After loading the app from the server, no data is sent back to it. Tasks you enter are saved in the local database of your web browser. This means your data remains on your device at all time. The drawback is that for now, no synchronisation between devices or even different browsers on the same device.<br><br>== Keyboard Shortcuts ==<br><br>I prefer using the keyboard over the mouse, so here are some shortcuts:<br><br>Anywhere (except while adding tasks):<br>a - Add new tasks<br><br>While adding tasks:<br>Ctrl+Enter - Add the entered tasks to the system<br>Esc - Cancel without adding the entered tasks<br><br>While doing a task:<br>f - Mark the task as finished<br>r - Re-add the task at the end of the list<br><br>When choosing between two tasks:<br>1 - Choose the first task<br>2 - Choose the second task <br><br>== Feature Requests / Feedback ==<br><br>Feel free to report bugs and request changes here.<br><br>So far I have: <br>- Mark said one should have the option to view the whole list. I will add this in the next version.<br>- Jesse expressed the hope that there would be not feature bloat. To address this, the current version will be available at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/v1/">http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/v1/</a> even after I released a new version. So existing users can choose to keep using the old version or to migrate their tasks to the current version at any time.<br><br>== Planned Features ==<br><br>- Show whole list for review<br>- Remove tasks<br>- Re-prioritize<br>- Synchronization - That is a big maybe, since I don't need it. (I have my private list on my iPad and my work list on my work PC, which is sufficient for me.) Plus it opens a big can of worms like saving your data in the cloud after all, you'd need an account and so forth.

Is that to handle the part of the FVP instructions that allows you to make changes to your selected tasks like this:<br><br>INITIAL chain:<br>• Go to the bank<br>  Learn to juggle armadillos<br>• Invent a new language<br>  Solve world peace<br>  Eat ice cream<br>• Put on pants<br>  File TPS report<br>  Hide from manager when TPS report is late<br>  <br>Using your app, after I complete (or re-add) the "Put on pants" task, I would then be faced with doing the "Invent a new language" tasks.  According to Mark's instructions though, I should be making a new decision: Which do I want to do more, "Invent a new language", or "File TPS report" (and then decide between "Invent a new language" or "Hide from manager" if appropriate).<br><br>Am I making sense here?  Is this something you have in the works.<br><br>Again, nice job!<br><br>-Pat</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 May 2015 at 19:11 | Pat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>This is great! I have a few questions....<br><br>1. Just to be clear, https://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/ will be the most up to date version, and  <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/v1/">http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/v1/</a> will be the original version?<br><br>2. If I put a task into the original version will that task carry over to the newest version? And vice versa? I'm worried about losing my data. On that note, is there a way for me to export my tasks just in case the site goes down? <br><br>3. A long task tends to overcrowd or spill out of the box. I've got some long sentences and url's for some of my tasks and when they are in the box on the top, the text overlaps the text in the bottom box making both hard to read. I end up zooming in and out of my browser quite a bit.<br><br>Even if you do no more work on the site, I really really appreciate this. I'm using it and it's a joy. I'm happy to use the newest version and any new features you add. I hope you stay with a focused view, though. That's really helpful as far as being motivated to stay on the current task.<br><br>I know it's not a priority for you (and I already have my own workaround solution), but synchronization would be game-changer. I'd pay money happily.<br><br>Thanks again!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 May 2015 at 21:04 | Jesse</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>As far as re-prioritization as a feature, I saw Mark's quote here:<br><br>"I'm actually coming to the conclusion that one should re-prioritize only as a last resort. I kept yesterday's prioritization going today and found it works better. If something becomes urgent or needs getting on with, then it's best to cross it out and re-enter it at the end of the list, rather than upset what is quite a delicate balancing act by the algorithm."<br>May 25, 2015 at 18:37 | Mark Forster</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 May 2015 at 21:34 | Jesse</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Nico:<br><br>Noted, but stats will probably have to wait until v3 or so.<br><br>Sean:<br><br>Yeah, Dropbox would have been nice. What actually should work without changing too much in the current implementation is synchronizing with a couchdb or couchbase database server. Unfortunately, that is not as trivial for a normal user to set up as something like Dropbox.<br><br>Pat:<br><br>No, re-priorization means removing all the dots and starting from the first task again. Initially Mark recommended doing that daily, which is why I wanted to do it automatically in the app at midnight. But as Jesse points out above, Mark changed his mind about the importance/usefulness of re-priorization, so it will be just a button one can press if the need arises, <br><br>The behavior you describe should already work in the app. i just added the tasks from your list, selected the three you marked and after finishing "Put on pants", it did ask me to choose between "Invent a new language" and "File TPS report". If that does not work for you, that must be a bug. In that case please let me now and I'll look into it.<br><br>Jesse:<br><br>1. Yes, that's how it is right now. The difference is not great between the two versions right now. i'll probably add the bugfixes I did to the v1 version and start v2 when I add the list management.<br><br>2. I have to make some changes to the internal data format for v2, so the data from v1 will not be usuable as is. I will give you a means to export your data (coming soon) and migrate it to v2 (coming with v2), plus I will never delete the date for v1, so even if something goes wrong or you don't like v2, you can just go to the /v1 url and everything will be as you left it.<br><br>3. I think I fixed that issue in the current version, can you check?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 May 2015 at 21:59 | Andreas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>"3.

I updated v1 to contain the following additional features compared to the first post in this topic:<br><br>1. Automatic detection of http links and email addresses and making them clickable<br><br>2. Additionally, you can use this markdown-inspired format to create links of any kind:<br>[display text](url)<br>For example. "Click [here](<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://google.com)&quot;">http://google.com)"</a> will be displayed as "Click here" and "here" will be a link ot google.com. While auto-detection only works for http:// urls, this method should work for all kinds of urls, for example omnifocus://, evernote:// or similar.<br><br>3. A very basic way to get the tasks you entered back out of the system: https://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/v1/export/<br>Note that this does not include tasks that have been finished.<br><br>4. Minor bugs and styling fixes.<br><br>If you prefer stability, I recommend starting to use https://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/v1/ exclusively now. It will not be updated again with the possible exception of bug fixes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>28 May 2015 at 21:19 | Andreas Maurer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I'm now at work and using <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/">http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/</a> on a different computer, which has a different list, my work-related tasks. It remembered everything and that's great, but the key commands don't work and the issue I mentioned with the text spilling out of the boxes is back. <br><br>I'm assuming it's because I'm using Internet Explorer 10, and not Chrome like I was at home.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 May 2015 at 3:18 | Jesse</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Jesse:<br><br>That sounds like Internet Explorer has cached the old version locally and is not fetching the new version.

I tried it out tonight after adding my very long list of items. I was going to make a few recommendations, but you already mentioned all of them in your comment of upcoming features you would like to add. I love the simplicity, but would like to be able to reprioritize the list at any point. Being able to see the whole list and bulk dismiss would also be nice. But it is already a very usable application as it is. I would also request the ability to view the history. That might be easier to implement than stats, but very helpful to review at the end of the day.

Being able to use an app to better develop the app itself is one of the perks of creating a todo app, I guess. I had a productive Saturday today thanks to FVP and here are the results: <br><br>1. <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/">http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/</a> will be a landing page in the future to host an instruction manual and to let you directly choose the version of the app you want. Most of that is yet to come, but the take-away is to directly go to /v1 or /v2 for the app in the future.<br><br>2. <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/v1/">http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/v1/</a> remains as it was as a fallback for everyone who has problems with v2.<br><br>3. <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/v2">http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/v2</a> now hosts the new version with some major new features. When you first visits, it creates a copy of your tasks from v1. From then on, the two lists are separate, which means if anything goes wrong in v2, you'll find your data untouched when going back to v1. The app is more complex now, so there is a larger probability of bugs, especially this early. You'll have to decide which one to use.<br><br>== New Features ==<br><br>- New layout. Less minimal, but still pretty minimal. I like it.<br><br>- A settings screen that for now allows you to<br><br>    - Re-prioritise your list (as in "reset the pre-selection")<br><br>    - Clear your list (as in "remove all tasks and start completely from scratch")<br><br>- A list view to show your whole list, and if you hover over a task you get<br><br>    - An option to re-add/move it to the end of the list<br>    - An option to delete the task<br><br>- When adding tasks, the text field start small now and automatically grows as you enter text. That looks pretty neat and fixes some weird scrolling behaviour on iPhone/iPad.<br><br>== Things Still Missing ==<br><br>The following things are still work in progress in v2 and I will address them in the next few days, hopefully tomorrow:<br><br>- Keyboard navigation for the new screens is basically non-existent. You can use the tab and enter keys to get around, but I'll add a lot more shortcuts.<br><br>- The list view is not very usable for mobile/touch devices, especially the iPhone. I think about a solution for that one.<br><br>== Next version ==<br><br>I actually did not change the data format yet, so in v2 there is still almost no metadata saved with a task, e.g. date added, date selected, date started, date finished. Also finished tasks are completely removed. To implement any form of stats, I need to change the data format for v3.<br><br>The data format is also something to consider when trying to add any form of synchronisation. I'm still not sure it can be done without saving anything on my server.<br><br>Well, that's it for now. I need to finish my day. If you have any feed back for the new features, or missing ones, let me know.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>30 May 2015 at 23:38 | Andreas Maurer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Great update!!

(raised by Jesse earlier)<br><br>There are many recurring tasks I really just want to do once daily (or even less often).

But when I've actioned it recently, and don't want to see it again for a day or two, I'd like to "snooze" it so it doesn't show up.<br><br>This goes outside the scope of the FVP algorithm, of course.    For most of Mark's systems, I've implemented this idea by keeping recurring reminders in a tickler -- either a paper tickler, or in Outlook reminders.  When the tickler item comes due, I enter it into the list, and then snooze the tickler item again.<br><br>It would be really cool if this kind of snoozing could be done inside an app like amFVP -- but maybe this is the kind of feature creep you are trying to avoid.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>2 June 2015 at 15:45 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Little bug on version 1.

FVP seems like the best system for me so far, but I can't do it nearly as well on paper as I can with your app.  When I use paper,  I tend to skim along quickly looking at the whole page at once and not doing a disciplined A vs. B, A vs. C comparison.  This is not a fault of the FVP system but of me.  I seem to have attention surplus disorder and need to look at many items at once.  <br><br>Your app forces me to do a one on one comparison  and I make more thoughtful decisions.  I am having a particularly busy time in my life (family member in hospital, major system upgrade this weekend) and the combination of Mark's brilliant system and your fantastic app is keeping me functioning at a higher level than any time I can recall.<br><br>The features you recently suggested (time-based trigger, Pomodoro timer, and the ability to switch between multiple lists) would all be wonderful for me.  I have many recurring tasks that I have to keep re-adding and then not picking until the appropriate time.  I currently use a separate Pomodoro timer.  Also,  I maintain a separate home and work list by using different computers.<br><br>So Andreas, thanks again for your wonderful work and your generosity with your time.<br><br>Live long and prosper.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>3 June 2015 at 22:01 | ERIC</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Yup.

Personally, I'd prefer the "snooze" option - it seems more flexible, and it's more in tune with what I already do in the iPhone Mailbox app with emails, and also how I usually manage recurring Outlook tasks.   But it's probably harder to code, too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>4 June 2015 at 4:32 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Thank you so much for implementing this, Andreas! (And thanks to Mark -- I just donated again!)<br><br>Alas, I have a tragic story. I was accumulating a list of ideas to include in this post but then lost them all, due to what I think counts as a bug in amFVP, so I'll just describe the bug (alternatively: my stupidity):<br><br>I've been using amFVP for a week or so now and loving it. When I noticed how quickly you've been making improvements I impulsively hit Refresh in the middle of a chain, to make sure I was on the latest version. And... sadness! My task list seems to have reverted to what it was days earlier.<br><br>For me a key feature of FVP is, as GTD puts it, having a system where you can dump ideas and put them out of your mind with complete faith that your system will bring them back to your attention. So I'm wondering if it would be safer to drop the database and instead have the program write the tasks to a text file every time.<br><br>If you could also specify the location of that text file you could point it to a Dropbox folder and have the best of all worlds: local execution and no login, but also the ability to use the same list on different computers. And I'm pretty sure that even if someone went completely overboard and accumulated 100s or 1000s of tasks there'd be no noticeable performance hit from writing and re-reading it all from a text file with every task addition/completion.<br><br>Or maybe I'm confused about I managed to lose my latest tasks? Could a rogue browser refresh cause that?<br><br>Thanks again for building it and sharing it!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>4 June 2015 at 17:03 | Daniel Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Daniel Reeves:<br><br>Could you tell me which browser you used?

This would lead to losing all changes after that moment. To prevent this, any change will now trigger an immediate warning and prompt to refresh if the sync is lost. If that last change was adding tasks, which have not yet been saved to the db, they will be listed on the resulting error page so they can be rescued by copying them.<br><br>This is not the most convenient solution, but it should prevent data loss until backend synchronization gets implemented.

I set up the address for the web app to open when I opened a new tab so I could have quick entry for fast capturing of ideas and thoughts. I'm very much a student of GTD, where I collect everything that pops into my head. <br><br>This is probably why my lists are so so long as well. <br><br>I'm very much used to using Google tasks and Google Keep, where it seems to keep stuff synced across every tab and every device, so it was tough to remember to enter things in only one "session" of amFVP. Unfortunately, this and the thought that I could lose my data (even through a mistake I'll probably make myself) builds up "resistance" to collecting the thought in amFVP.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>5 June 2015 at 19:03 | Jesse</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Andreas, I totally did!

The app is very functional as it is  so we can survive without any tweaking or updates.  Focus on your family (add that to your FVP list).  We'll be here when you have more time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>8 June 2015 at 21:50 | ERIC</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I'm using amFVP on differente PCs with different browsers. With MS explorer it always work correctly. On the contrary, with chrome and firefox sometime it does not work: the buttons on the top right part of the page do not react to clicking, so it becomes impossible to load the list of tasks.<br><br>Someone else is having the same experience? Any workaround?<br><br>Thank you</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 June 2015 at 16:16 | nick61</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I have seen this too, in Firefox. however for me, clicking a  2nd or 3rd time usually works.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 June 2015 at 17:55 | Beth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>nick61, Beth:<br><br>After looking into your issue, I found that the SVG icons in the buttons sometimes swallowed the click event. The second or third click worked because you slightly moved the cursor between clicks. I never stumbled upon this because I tend to click buttons in the lower-right corner area. I fixed the issue for v2 (v1 doesn't have it because it has no SVG icons).  Please refresh your browser and check if it works for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 June 2015 at 15:56 | Andreas Maurer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Windows: IE (ok), Firefox (OK), Chrome (OK)<br>Linux: Firefox (OK), Chrome (OK)<br><br>Thanks a lot!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 June 2015 at 21:13 | nick61</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Cool, thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 June 2015 at 1:13 | Beth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Heh. I'm actually back to using version one on my iphone.
