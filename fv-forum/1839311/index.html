I did like the approach of Do It Tomorrow, and used some of the suggestions in it, until my old habit of procrastinating and doing stuff at the last minute took over again. When AF appeared it appealed to me and I started building my list and slowly working on the tasks. However, eventually (as in a few days later), the old habits again started to conquer the ideal of "the new and improved me".<br><br>The same thing happened again with FV. I actually find the system appealing, maybe not as appealing as AF, but the real problem isn't the system, it's picking up the list. I may write the ultimate to-do list (or closed list or whatever), but sooner or later I'll abandon it. So I'm wondering what others in a similar situation have done? <br><br>I'm working with children, and there's little paper work and little deadline-related work. But when there's something I should be doing, I'll often put it off until it becomes urgent or others will rely on my work. The main problem for me is probably at home and related to community work (websites and similar), where I'm a notorious procrastinator and messy. AF or FV will help me get some of the clutter away, but then I'll stop picking up the list (paper or electronic) and keep being messy... <br><br>So to me the real problem isn't finding which kind of list is the best, but finding some way to committing to do anything at all. If you've been struggling with clutter (physical and mental) and procrastination, what did you do to get rid of it and keep the procrastination at bay? I'd be thankful for any advice. <br><br>- Christian</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>28 May 2012 at 7:12 | christianm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>What helps me with tasks that I tend to put off:<br>- write about them, just type away;<br>- tiny habits / next actions / whatever you call it: don't plan to make a Final Version ladder, just plan to dot the first item in your list (same as: don't plan to run 3 miles, just plan to get your training gear on); when you focus on the entire task, you will think of all kinds of trouble you might run into, so what helps me is just focussing on the very next action;<br><br>good luck</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>28 May 2012 at 8:47 | Thorin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Christian,<br><br>It also helps to keep the list short.

Working in short bursts feels much more focussed and flexible, but just try both and see what you prefer.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 June 2012 at 17:17 | Thorin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Julie Morgenstern's article tells what I've been doing for a year now, but I see now i nneed to do time mapping more thoroughly. Draw a chart for your standard time allocation each day. Example 8 hrs at work. Subdivide as desired. Assign meetings, apptments, project blocks, relaxation, exercise where you want them. assign a Mark Forster system to one or more large chunks of time. And work from that. For FV, be aware when you are scheduled to quit and adjust your working/selecting accordingly. <br>Having this time map can also be a key to defining hooks to use in the 3 habits tool.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 June 2012 at 20:12 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@ Thorin : Have you read the thread <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1842252">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1842252</a> about Decremental Time Box ( ing ) ?<br><br>I used it the second day today and it starts to be fun, even though I still have to get used to the decreasing "short" time bursts ;) It does support the "little and often" principle in a very excellent way.<br><br>GMBW suggested to use the number of preselected items as the starting point in the Decremental Time Box : nice idea to allocate more time to the important / urgent / priority tasks!<br><br>I, however, am more inclined to use this technique mostly, but not exclusively, for the ( big ) projects I have committed to.

Say for example that you decide to work on a task / project for 3 / 4 of an hour - "till the next hard fact hits your boat.<br><br>You do look up the list and see that you start with a 09 minutes session. Yes, only 09 minutes. After that you either want to have a break or you just continue with the next session of 08 minutes … down to 01 minute. Little and often in pure form ? The sum of all the intensive / focused minutes you have worked on the task / project add up to 0.75 hours!<br><br>&gt;&gt; Yes, I have, but I don't want my time to be governed by a mathematical trick, I want to decide for myself how much time to spend on what. But I haven't tried the decremental time box myself, and if it works for other people, that's fine. &lt;&lt;<br><br>No mathematical trick is at work here. Just plain old summing up. And yes, you're deciding how much time you want to spend for a specific task / project. It only helps you in breaking down the planned time frame into nice and little chunks of "work" :)<br><br>Again, it might not be everyone's cup of tea!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>2 June 2012 at 22:03 | Stefano F. Rausch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Stefano<br>OK, so you'll work those 9, 8, 7 ... minutes blocks on just one project/task. I understand now.<br><br>What I do is make a ladder, e.g. select tasks A, B and C, and then spend 5 minutes on C, 10 on B (because that's an important one) and another 5 minutes on A. Then I'll create a new ladder and so on. I'm using Tea Timer 1.5.3 (or a physical timer when not behind the computer) to warn me when the 5/10 minutes are over.<br>This way I'm applying the Little &amp; Often principle, while still being able to spend more time on important tasks. The addition of a timer motivates me to stick to FV.<br><br>If a project/task is urgent, and you have to work just on that project, the decremental time box seems like a good tool to slice it up.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>3 June 2012 at 9:57 | Thorin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@ Thorin : Exactly! The ( nearly ) perfect tool for project-related work from a little-and-often / time point of view combined with the good advise to have breaks in between time bursts to be even more productive.<br><br>After preselecting the next FV chain to work on you can nevertheless be very flexible regarding "special" tasks. E.g. and following your last example you have selected 3 tasks. This is according to the original idea of the Decremental Time Box ( DTB ) a work time of 0.10, i.e. 6 minutes: ( 1 ) 03 minutes ( 2 ) 2 minutes and ( 3 ) 1 minute. I leave the pondering to you - "work as long on the task as you feel is right / want to " should be applied here instead ;)<br><br>Now you can introduce a variant: you have decided to work for 05 minutes on task C, 10 minutes on task B and again 05 minutes on task A. If you want to use the DTB as a guide how to split these single tasks' work times in even tinier time chunks, this could be applied as follows - just an example:<br><br>( 1 ) task C 05 minutes translate to 03 on the scale adding up to 06 minutes : 6 is nearer to 3 ;)<br><br>( 2 ) task B 10 minutes translate to 04 on the scale adding up to exactly 10 minutes :)<br><br>( 3 ) task A 05 works as task C.<br><br>The only question in this respect is : is this not too much of a burden than just following your way of working off the time allocated ? For your example I would say yes - even though the one or other would like to nevertheless apply the slicing.<br><br>A second variant would be : use DTB only for the "one" task you feel you have to work on "longer", but in a time controlled way and work off all the other, wherever they are in the preselected list, according to your gut feeling, i.e. as long as you want to.<br><br>What I am currently doing is : ( 1 ) in general not to apply DTB on a preselected FV chain as a whole. I do apply DTB for a single task though, depending on how much ( controlled ) time I would like to spend on it - the second variant mentioned above ( 2 ) applying DTB for project-related work when I have only a certain discretionary time available - does force you not to loose yourself too much in the project,  e.g. if you are in the "flow" :D</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>3 June 2012 at 12:00 | Stefano F. Rausch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>To add a practical example for what I am currently doing is ( 1 ) mentioned in my previous post :<br><br>When having preselected my task to check the email inbox and hence to work it off to Zero Inbox and it is its turn to be worked on, I like to force myself to work on it only for a maximum of 36 minutes - one can use time in a better way than looking at emails, which I do 2 times a day only ;) So I do start with an 08 minute time burst.<br><br>It is astonishing, when following the "1. delete 2. delegate 3. do 2 minutes 4. defer 5. archive" rule, how fast one can clean up the inbox. DTB does help me to stay focused in that respect and not to immediately start to work on a current email task and hence to spend hours in the inbox … it happened too many times that I "woke up" and had to realise that time flew and other tasks where still waiting in the FV chain - not a good way to reduce self-imposed stress :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>3 June 2012 at 12:16 | Stefano F.

If you've been struggling with clutter (physical and mental) and procrastination, what did you do to get rid of it and keep the procrastination at bay? I'd be thankful for any advice. &gt;<br><br>For me what works best is to contain the clutter in some way, lists, backlogs, boxes. Then start chipping away at the easier stuff while thinking of better ways and routines to deal with it and keep it under control, as well as tackle the more intractable stuff.<br><br>Having a daily plan can help, as feels better to plan and accomplish say 1/2 hr on something than do a random amount and feel you've still got 95% to go. What hopefully happens is you end up doing an hour or two and feel even better about it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>4 June 2012 at 10:57 | smileypete</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
