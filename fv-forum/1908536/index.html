I really like the metronome effect of A2 — where you action a task and then swing down to the end of the list and back up. <br><br>My adaptation is reversed in approach, in that I start with a base of FV and add A2 features (FV/A2) whereas nuntym's starts with an A2 base and adds FV features (A2/FV) like FV's non-dismissal and focus on oldest un-actioned tasks. It sounds very promising and I'll be trying it as my main system today. Here's nuntym's A2 adaptation:<br><br>1. Make a list of tasks. <br>2. Write any new task at the end of the list.<br>3. Delete the oldest task and re-write it at the end of the list (unless that oldest task is already irrelevant, upon which delete it and go to the next oldest task).<br>4. Starting from the end of the list, choose the task that "stands out" then do it.<br>5. Upon doing what needs to be done on the item, delete it. If needed, re-write at the end<br>6.

(courtesy of Cricket); adding a small circle in front of any task in the morning that "must be done today" and then only making chains out of circled items until they are all done, filling in the circle to dot the task and treating the oldest "circled" task as the root (Mark has mentioned before that "must be done today" tasks should be actioned after "drop everything and do now" tasks and before "everything else" tasks.); and finally, limiting the time frame of a chain.<br><br>#2 FV (asking "What makes sense to do before X?)<br><br>#3 A2<br><br>I found I liked using A2 the best and that FV was the most balanced of Mark's systems (a balance between urgency, importance, easiness, difficulty, and resistance) but lacks a push to finish unfinished tasks, a visual cue and push to complete of "must be done today" tasks, the ability to spot tasks that are suddenly urgent but are not new while working a chain, the increasing irrelevancy of a chain as time passes, and the inability to easily adjust sequence without re-writes.<br><br>Mark described AutoFocus 2 as "...one of the less successful methods, and I don’t think many people use it now." After trying it, seeing its high scores during my tests, and experiencing how simple, fun and effective it is to use I couldn't believe more people weren't using it. It's a beautiful little system.<br><br>SuperFocus was the first system of Mark's I tried and is the best system for pushing you to finish tasks and showing you a heads-up display of your urgent tasks. It is the drill-sergeant of time management systems and was revolutionary for me. I'd love to see a SuperFocus 4, perhaps a page-less version. <br><br>During my system tests I noticed qualities of SuperFocus in Final Version but am still looking for the most effective way to add the "push to finish" mechanism of SuperFocus to a hybrid of Final Version and AutoFocus 2. I've tried re-writing unfinished tasks at the end of the list with a circle and adding those to every chain in a couple of ways but would like to hear how others might approach adding a "push to finish" mechanism to FV, FV/A2, or A2/FV.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 August 2012 at 13:26 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Did you describe your approach here?  I'm not seeing it.  Anyway, the problem with AF2 was that it neglected the older tasks and thus got too hung up by urgency.  AF3 solved this but it neglected the middle tasks and didn't have the fluidity of AF2.  So AF4 was invented, and it didn't neglect any tasks but it lacked the push to finish.  SF3 solved that but was a bit too complicated/slow/pushy.  <br><br>FV doesn't have any of the above problems, but for some the list grows too unwieldy, and I guess for you and nuntym it doesn't push enough to finish things.  Me, I don't quite see it.  If you keep the list under control, it's easy enough to have any given task executed every 5th item, or given the freedom to reselect something, every second item.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 August 2012 at 14:29 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Alan - great summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the AF series.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>1 August 2012 at 16:42 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>+JMJ+<br><br>@Michael B.: <br><br>Autofocus 2: Final Version?

Delete the oldest task and re-write it at the end of the list (unless that oldest task is already irrelevant, upon which delete it and go to the next oldest task).&gt;&gt;<br><br>As I explained in <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1900291#item1908103">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1900291#item1908103</a><br><br>&lt;&lt; The tweak of re-writing the oldest, still-relevant items to the end of the list everytime I choose tasks solved this issue. Not only did it bring to fore the oldest and most neglected items in the list, it also helps in trimming down the list. Please note that, from the instructions above, if the oldest task is already irrelevant, it is deleted and then you go to the next oldest task to determine its worthiness to be re-written; that next oldest task can still be deleted, and so on with th rest. If I had done twenty tasks today, then I had rewritten twenty old tasks to the fore, but I could also have deleted some or many tasks too.&gt;&gt;<br><br>&lt;&lt;I started almost a week ago with this form of AF2 with a list of 80+ tasks, which is the list I have been using for the past couple of months using various other time management systems I tried. Now, that same list has 36 tasks. I think that should speak by itself. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Now it's 39.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>3 August 2012 at 2:21 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@nuntym - it may speak for the ability of the system to self-regulate, or it may speak to a natural equilibrium that you have personally established.   I don't see how the system itself would push you toward an equilibrium if (for example) you added 25 tasks every day and deleted 15.   The list would just grow longer and longer until it became unworkable.   The only sign the system would give you, that something was awry, would be that it would feel more and more unworkable, without a clear indication of WHY.   I don't see how moving the oldest task forward wouldn't make much difference.<br><br>In contrast, a system like DWM throws away a good sized chunk of unactioned items every day.  As a direct result of this mechanism, the list eventually achieves an equilibrium.  The total list size stays more-or-less constant, no matter how many new tasks you throw at it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>3 August 2012 at 5:31 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>+JMJ+<br><br>What makes the difference is that you are re-writing only the oldest /relevant/ items. Because of that requirement, you'd have to individually evaluate the oldest items, which (at least in my experience) really helps in cutting down the size of the list.<br><br>The dismissal process of DWM and DWM2, on the other hand, is too artificial, too blunt, and takes too long. It also fosters an ignorance of what the oldest tasks are because of both the evental length of the list and the less drive to work on those older tasks until they are almost a month old. I say that as someone who had used DWM2 for months.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>3 August 2012 at 14:47 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I wasn't trying to advocate for DWM overall - I agree with the shortcomings you've identified.<br><br>I was only pointing out that it DOES have an algorithmic method for regulating the total list size.  None of the AF systems have that, and I still don't think your AF2 variant has that, either.  It may be able to handle a high volume of tasks quite well!   but that's not the same thing as having a built-in mechanism for establishing an equilibrium.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>3 August 2012 at 22:16 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Alan:<br><br>"Did you describe your approach here?"<br><br>...

Preselect using the question "What makes sense to do before X?".<br><br>2. After actioning each item, quickly scan down to the end of the list dotting anything along the way that needs doing before the item ahead of it in the chain. <br><br>3. Continue actioning your chain in reverse starting from the last dotted item.<br><br><br><br>FV with Today Loops: <br>Standard FV or FV/A2 but each morning adding a small circle in front of any task that "must be done today" and only making chains out of circled items until they are all done, filling in the circle to dot the task and treating the oldest looped task as the root.<br><br><br><br>FV/A1 with Today Fence (Heads-Up Display of must do today tasks): <br><br>1. At the start of each day draw a line at the end of your list.<br><br>2. Starting from the beginning of your list, cross out any tasks that must be done today — or else serious consequences will occur — and re-write them below the line.<br><br>3. Go through your reminder or calendar system writing down anything that *must* be done today on your list.<br><br>4. Finally, write down anything else you can think of that must be done today, skip a few page lines, and draw a line at the end of your list. <br> <br>5. Preselect as normal.<br><br>6. Before actioning your chain you must work on at least one fenced-off today task first. Choose the one that feels most ready to do, leave it unmarked, and do a little work on it.<br><br>7. If a fenced-off task is unfinished, leave it unmarked. If a task is completed cross it out.<br><br>8. Continue circulating through the "today yard" working on any tasks that feel ready to be done. <br><br>9. When no more fenced-off tasks feel ready to be done, begin actioning your chain.<br><br>10. When you are done working on your chain return to rule 5.<br><br>No fenced-off items leave the yard unless you have determined they are no longer critical for today or they are complete, in which case they are crossed-out and re-written at the end of your list or left to your reminder system until next time.<br><br><br><br>FV with SF push-to-completion:<br><br>1. Preselect as normal.<br><br>2. After actioning an item, if unfinished, cross-out and re-write at the end of your list with a small circle in front of it.<br><br>3. Continue actioning your chain.<br><br>4. If any urgent items come in, add them to the end of your list, dot them, and do them next or now. If any unfinished tasks become urgent, fill in the circle so as to dot it and do it next or now.<br><br>5. When you are done working your chain, return to rule 1, and when you come upon any tasks with small circles in front, you must fill in the circles to dot the tasks, and work your chain in reverse order starting from the last dotted task when done preselecting.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>11 August 2012 at 8:38 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Which worked?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>12 August 2012 at 4:10 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I too would be interested in knowing Michael which system you ended up using.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 August 2012 at 21:00 | Peter D.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Alan and Peter:<br><br>I'm testing new ideas, but out of the above, I would try the "today box" idea as it was the most consistently useful.

If you're after more life balance and some visual feedback from your lists, segmented lists act as a form of bar chart showing the activity in each area of your life. Instead of using three pages, new and old tasks on one, recurring on another, and unfinished on a third, you dedicate a page to each major hat you wear in life and rename the recurring page to "general recurring" for all your general maintenance tasks without a specific area of life they belong under. <br><br><br>FV Areas:<br><br>1. Write down the major hats you wear in life at the end of your list along with a tiny circle in front of each.<br><br>2. To preselect a list of things to do, first dot the oldest unactioned "hat" on your list (if you *can't* dot it because of conditions, simply dot the next oldest unactioned "hat") and prefix the standard FV question as follows: "As a (builder/writer/friend/etc.) what do I want to do before X?", ignoring any task not addressed by the question. This skimming process will be very quick.<br><br>3. Action your ladder as per FV instructions, ignoring the dotted "hat".<br><br>4.

Please note, that in the following method, it would be helpful to mark all unfinished tasks with a small circle in the margin - though it is not expressly necessary to do so.<br><br>1.  Begin the FV preselect list as usual, dotting the root task.<br>2.  Consider the root task's level of "Urgency" as one of the following:<br><br>Could Begin - Untouched Tasks that can wait until later if needed<br>Ought to Finish - Unfinished Tasks that you don't want to fizzle and die<br>Shouldn't Drop - Anything (finished or unfinished, reoccuring or not) that you don't want to lag behind<br>Must Handle - Anything that must be actioned today, and / or finished in short order<br><br>3.  To build the preselect list from there, scan down the list and dot the next task that "makes sense to do before x" that has a higher degree of urgency (using the above groups) than the previous task.  <br><br>4.  By this method I preselect, at most, 1 Task from each level of urgency with the exception of Must Handle - I allow myself to preselect up to 2 of those tasks per chain.  This way I deal with the most urgent more frequently, and thereby driving myself to finish them sooner.  I also generally consider a task to have been actioned when I have completed the next action to move that task forward.  But but with the Must Handle tasks, I consider the next two actions to be the bare minimum.  This last part is more of a mental discipline than a systemic rule.<br><br>5.  I combine this with AndreasE's proposed dismissal process for FV in his post "Reintroducing Dismissing Into FV" (Instead of dotting the first open task as your root, dot the fist item that stands out AF1 style on the first page.  If you pass over a whole page without dotting a root, dismiss the whole page, and look for the root on the next page.  Review dismissed pages AF1 style, with a reoccuring "Review Dismissed" task)<br><br>I find that the above method pushes me to finish what I started (by giving some degree of priority to unfinished), even more so if what I started is also urgent in some way.  Additionally, it keeps my preselect lists short (max of 5 tasks in a single chain), and the dismissal helps keep my list itself short.  This shorter overall list and shorter preselect list ensures easier, and more frequent preselections overall, allowing me to be much more flexible.<br><br>I like your hat wearing idea, and I may incorporate it into the above method.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 October 2012 at 12:21 | Miracle</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
