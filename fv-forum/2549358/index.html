The newer, "final version perfected" (FVP) is basically an adjustment to the Final Version, particularly in the way tasks are preselected once you get going.  Instructions on FVP are over on the blog, scroll down to May 15th for the complete instructions for FVP. I believe you can access it through this link:<br><br> <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/5/21/the-final-version-perfected-fvp.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/5/21/the-final-version-perfected-fvp.html</a><br><br>Hope that helps! On a personal note, this is an amazing system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 October 2015 at 20:07 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Thank you, Paul! That explanation is really helpful. <br><br>Does anyone have an opinion about which way is best for a newbie to start with? It seems that the FVP version maybe has a bit more scanning in between doing the tasks you have marked, right?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 October 2015 at 20:37 | Elisabeth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Elisabeth:<br><br>Thanks for flagging up Sarah Michele Ford's video, which I hadn't seen before. She does make it really clear. And yes it is FV which she is describing.<br><br>The difference between FV and FVP is that the FV "ladder" only contains a selection of tasks before the first active task on the list. In other words, you are only doing *some* of the tasks which would be better done before the first task.<br><br>FVP on the other hand puts *all* the tasks in the right order. Yes, this does involve a bit more scanning, though probably not as much as you would think. It is very easy to do, and very responsive to changes in circumstances.<br><br>The various changes in FVP have only been in the question asked. My current favourite is to ask the same question as in FV, i.e. "What do I want to do before... ?"<br><br>My advice would be to start with FVP. It's easier to do (because FV has a tendency to increase resistance to the tasks after a while), it's more comprehensive and it's more responsive to changes in urgency. Nevertheless FV is still an excellent system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 October 2015 at 21:29 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Hello, Mark! <br><br>Thank you so much for your detailed response to my question! Yes, I found Sarah Michele Ford's video to be very helpful to help me understand FV. <br><br>Thank you for helping me understand the difference between FV and FVP. I did try FVP today with a short list (about 14 items) and really, really was impressed with how much work I got done and how intuitive it is to use. <br><br>Something you wrote on this website was helpful for me. That FVP is designed for tasks you do with discretionary time. I think I've been hoping to find a "system" that will manage everything ... routine/daily type tasks, project management, reference, etc. Your comment that FVP is like one tool in the toolbox is very helpful. Now I just have to figure out which other tools to use! <br><br>For instance, I'm wondering if you can assist me with what to do with the (myriad!) of ideas that come to mind every day. They are not usually immediately implementable, but are not things I'm willing to just let go. <br><br>Also, I'm finding managing the multitude of projects that are my responsibility well (keeping track of everything that has to be done, figuring out which project to do next, being sure I'll remember a project that's needed in the future, etc.).

I developed FVP after I wrote the book so you may prefer it to the system I mention in the book. The book is about productivity rather than time management so 99% of the book applies whatever time management system you use.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 October 2015 at 23:29 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark, <br><br>Thank you so much. I started reading The Secrets of Productive People last night and it's excellent!<br><br>I will try putting my projects and my ideas into FVP. I think it will work well for me. <br><br>As far as discretionary time, as a teacher and mother, I feel like I don't have very much of that, but I will seek to use FVP to maximize the time that I do have. <br><br>When I'm seeking something to use for my project notes and files, I will definitely consider Evernote. I have used it in the past some. I love how you can put anything in it, even photos. But I've found it to be a little slow. I'm using SimpleNote right now, which is very fast and clean. You can only enter text however, so it limits what I can save. <br><br>Well, thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. After I've been using FVP for a while, I will plan to let you know how it is going. Now my biggest challenge is to not put too many tasks into the system all at once and overload it!<br><br>Gratefully, <br>Elisabeth</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 October 2015 at 11:31 | Elisabeth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I have some more questions after using FVP for a few days. (And I've really gotten so much done with this system!) <br><br>1. I think based on what I've read here that I should not just move the three remaining tasks on my first page to the end of the list if I've not worked on them. Am I right? And if so, I'm curious as to why.<br><br>2. I'm seeing lots of different questions that people use, as well as a "no question" version. Do you think it's a good idea to just use "What do I want to do before X?" as my question, or is there a compelling reason to do anther one, or no question at all? <br><br>Thank you!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 October 2015 at 19:13 | Elisabeth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Elisabeth:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I think based on what I've read here that I should not just move the three remaining tasks on my first page to the end of the list if I've not worked on them. &gt;&gt;<br><br>In theory it shouldn't make any difference where in the list a particular task is. That's because FVP uses a sorting algorithm to put things in the right order. In practice it's probably not quite as simple as that!<br><br>There's nothing to stop you moving a task or tasks to the end of the list if you want to. <br><br>&lt;&lt;  I'm seeing lots of different questions that people use, as well as a "no question" version. Do you think it's a good idea to just use "What do I want to do before X?" as my question, or is there a compelling reason to do anther one, or no question at all? &gt;&gt;<br><br>As I said, FVP uses a sorting algorithm, which sorts tasks in whatever order you decide. If your question was "What is more difficult than x?", you'd get the tasks in descending order of difficulty. If your question was "What is easier than x?" you'd get the tasks in ascending order of difficulty. So the question is very important, but it needs to fit what you want. "What do I want to do before x?" is a good way of getting at what you want and I suggest you start there. But once you've got a bit of experience, you might want to experiment with other questions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 October 2015 at 19:31 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Perfect. Thank you, Mark! <br><br>I have to mention that I love the simplicity of this.
