I think that's because of the emphasis on doing 'what you want'.  I've got rid of a few lingering jobs very quickly.<br>However can anyone help me with one puzzle.  The order in which jobs are done is dependent on where they are on the list. So if I have tasks 1,2,3,4,5, I select 1 automatically, then select 3 but when I get to 5 I realise that I'd like to do it between 1 and 3.  There doesn't seem to be any way round this.  Any suggestions?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 16:12 | Lesley</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>+JMJ+<br><br>Delete 3 and re-enter it at the end with a dot ^___^</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 16:34 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I think FV is a little more sophisticated than "do what you want". It specifically asks, "What do you want to do before you do X?". So in your example, you only put a dot next to 4 if you want to do it before 3. And you only put a dot next to 5 if you want to do it before 4. If you want to do 5 after 3, presumably you also want to do it after 4. Therefore, 5 doesn't get a dot on this pass, and it will be done after 1. If 1 is impossible until 5 is done, then it should be moved to the bottom of the list and another benchmark should be selected.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 17:29 | FSE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>In my first few cycles of my FV list, I've run across this kind of thing pretty often.  It's funny how in math, (A &lt; B &lt; C) implies (A &lt; C), but with "what do I want to do before X?", I often find that (A &lt; B &lt; C) does NOT always imply (A &lt; C). <br><br>In other words, after pre-selection, I do NOT end up with a list of N tasks all cleanly sorted in ascending order of urgency.   This is because the wording of the question creates a nuanced comparison every time I actually perform the comparison.   When I compare A and B, I am using slightly different nuanced criteria than when I compare B and C.   But then if I went back and compared A and C, I might find that I'd actually want to do A first, and then C.<br><br>So this was a little puzzling, at an intellectual level.   On a practical level, however, it's very simple:   just follow the rules.   If you're working "little and often" you'll be doing a new preselection pretty soon anyway and it all gets sorted out pretty quickly in the end.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 18:31 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Thanks, everyone.

It is designed to come up with a rational ordering - one of many possible - and do so quickly. <br><br>The reason I think this is a feature is that it helps to break the habit of endless optimization without actual progress. FV gives you a decent plan that you can start right away - so stop tweaking the list and just get it started.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 20:31 | FSE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Even though numtym's answer will work, I strongly suggest not to follow that route.<br><br>There is a specific reason why you did preselect the tasks in that specific order. It would be too "easy" to just kick out a task only because you don't feel like doing it anymore or maybe only later. To take it to the extreme we could go back to a normal simple to-do list without any choosing algorithm to guide us and just pick out the task we want to do without any bad feelings …<br><br>Once I have preselected my list, I follow it to the dot, assuming nothing urgent or more important comes up. In that case I always return to the original working list and tackle the tasks one after the other. Up to now I only had positive results. I even enjoyed doing the "difficult" ones because the list gets shorter and shorter and I can already see me rewarding myself with nice and interesting tasks in the new preselected list to come ;)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 20:35 | Stefano F.

Exactly –&nbsp;imagine that: making a list of tasks and doing them! If someone just stumbled onto this forum and read about how we need an 'algorithm' for 'preselecting' a chain of tasks in strict order, remembering the essential difference in nuance between 'before' and 'more' and then had to follow the chain backwards and not break it, or, if it has to be broken, use a pencil or post-it tabs to facilitate rerunning the algorithm without losing the order of things as originally listed, he would probably think we're all crazy!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 22:58 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark's designs are a kind of magic trick. It may seem ridiculous, but in fact it's a carefully balanced system achieving multiple qualities of goodness that you wouldn't think possible in so few rules. In packing it all in there, he makes it easy to use, efficient, but also very sensitive to changes. You can't randomly tweak a Forster system, because most changes make it worse. Very much unlike GTD which pretty much needs to be adapted just to get off the ground.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 March 2012 at 0:00 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Ubi/Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; imagine that: making a list of tasks and doing them! &gt;&gt;<br><br>Well, that's probably where most of us started off from, including me.

The volume of new threads and comments in the FV forum has been amazing.  I only stayed with the new process for two days, but I do admit it motivated me to work several tasks that had been 'stuck' previously –&nbsp;mainly the non-optional first-item benchmarks.  Today, I'm back to my 4D+CL system.  May give FV another go in the future.<br><br>Cheers,</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 March 2012 at 0:50 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>FSE,<br>&lt;&lt;The reason I think this is a feature is that it helps to break the habit of endless optimization without actual progress.

I'm surprised that I'm vastly preferring the preselection to the old "standing out" method.<br><br>On the ordering problem, I often come to a task that "belongs" between two prior ones, but unless it *has* to be done in this ladder (so far it never has), I just tell it to wait until next time.<br><br><br>Stefano,<br>&lt;&lt;I even enjoyed doing the "difficult" ones because the list gets shorter and shorter and I can already see me rewarding myself with nice and interesting tasks in the new preselected list to come ;)&gt;&gt;<br><br>Me too.

Those of us who follow Mark do not do well if we are totally free to "do it" in any order we choose.
