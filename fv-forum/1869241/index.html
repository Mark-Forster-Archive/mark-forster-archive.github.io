It's certainly a tall order to fit all these features in, and keep a clean interface. At some point you run into either too much visual clutter or too much gestural conflation.

Swipe up/down to scroll list.  Tap top/bottom to go to top or bottom.  Tap item to select.  Drag it left/right/up/down/top/bottom to move it.  Double-tap for details.

I have no desire to hijack this thread with any self-promotion, but when I look at the list of desired features in the first post, I was surprised to see how many of these features FocusPad already has. What is does not have is a Mac or Windows version, which for many people is understandably a deal breaker. On the other hand, it does have a Web version with fast syncing. Another issue is that it has a very utilitarian look, which seemed very "clean" when it came out, but is starting to feel a tad dated now.<br><br>So I guess my question is this: how far is FocusPad from the "ideal" app? If it were only a few changes away, that would be ample motivation for me to revise and update it :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 June 2012 at 16:16 | Tony Mann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Tony<br>Focus pad is my favorite app but it is far from the ideal app. &nbsp;I looked through the first post list you are referring to and FocusPad misses many of the points.&nbsp;<br><br>I won't list all but here are a few:<br>• Tasks (with notes) are importable and exportable as text<br>• Lists can be texted or emailed<br>-Listed aren't searchable on the mobile app.&nbsp;<br>-contexts/filters!<br>-sublists etc.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall it is definitely the best app for autofocus. &nbsp;However, there haven't been updates for a long time. I believe there was a transition of authors and the last one didn't do any updates when superfocus came out even though they were promised.&nbsp;<br><br>FV is out and I believe the only update was to improve the graphics of the app. I could be wrong. But basically I haven't seen any significant difference to account for FV. &nbsp;Yes, I can highlight to preselect and swipe backwards but his is cumbersome. And it is an ad hoc method I came up with on my own to settle with the lack of a more efficient method like filtering the chain.&nbsp;<br><br>The updates are very rare and the last review is from Nov 14 2010.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm not a developer so I'm certain that I am greatly underestimating the complexity and time of adding features. But it seems it's been very long compared to other apps updates. &nbsp;I have received more updates from Clear and that came out probably 5 months ago. even Blanclist has given more significant updates in the right direction and it's  pretty new to the scene as well.&nbsp;<br><br>Many features from the Focuspad/FV post have been requested and I'm not certain what's the status, or what is the timeline. &nbsp;<br><br>So to answer your question, from a customers perspective and someone who has faith in this app, Focuspad is very far from an ideal app. Many apps offer the feature FP doesn't have (ex. Toodledo, clear, BlancList etc) and they have frequent updates, and they respond more to feedback.&nbsp;<br>Example: BlancList author doesn't quite have the perfect app, but I've corresponded and there was work done in the right direction. &nbsp;Little improvements here and there have been great.&nbsp;<br><br>The changes from autofocus to FV are few but still require some updating to the app. Many features have already been requested in the FP/FV thread along with feedback. That should be enough to motivate you and update. :)<br><br>What is the next 1 single feature at the top of your list?

You asked: "how far is FocusPad from the 'ideal' app?"<br><br>For FV, it's not far from ideal. For me, a native Mac app and rock-solid syncing between the Mac and iOS versions would get me to try it again. It would be great if the Mac app was a small window that looked identical to the iOS version on the iPhone's screen. Not sure how much work that would be.<br><br>The two things I like about FP are (1) the ability to enter new items quickly on the desktop (via the browser) and (2) the similarity to a paged written notebook (with everything staying in its place). <br><br>But I found that the browser-based sync was often very slow and occasionally broken, so I have given up using FP for now.  Sorry, but if page reloads don't happen swiftly, or I get a broken display (double entries, quota-exceeded error), or if the iOS app contents don't match the web contents, then I cannot trust this system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 June 2012 at 18:18 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I just started using the accomplist and it does indeed have most of the features of the 'ideal app' . I did speak to the developers , and they are going to be releasing versions across all platform soon.  It's probably the best organiser I have used so far. It's very simple to use and has quite a few sophisticated features like tagging , bulk operations , filtering and something called smart tagging which u find to be a simply brilliant concept. Implementation of fv using accomplist is really good and simple. Plus it's not just limited to FV , one can implement different task management techniques using it. Thank you naim for suggesting it .

My want list is much shorter. Out of the items on my list I have chosen the three it would take to get me aboard.<br><br>To come aboard the good ship FocusPad I would request these three changes:<br><br>• A setting to use every list as an endless-scrolling-list<br><br>• A touch-target for instant transport to the top and bottom of any list when endless-scrolling is active. (Without the page-centric features at the bottom, the list could go all the way to the bottom-edge where a touch-target could be inserted as in Clear for iOS, alternatively, the bottom bar could remain and other endless-scrolling-centric features could be placed to either side of the "transport to the bottom" touch-target.)<br><br>• Making the blue text color a readable shade of green instead.

Or does it require re-scheduling each time you complete it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 July 2012 at 5:04 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>&lt;delete&gt;</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 July 2012 at 17:15 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I am a big fan of FocusPad!<br><br>Tony, it does seem that people want tagging, searching, and filtering. Currently, the app has tagging and filtering of pages via the filled/empty diamond system, but only for pages and not tasks, so that is clearly necessary. <br><br>To Michael B.'s points<br><br>&gt; • A setting to use every list as an endless-scrolling-list<br><br>Currently, FocusPad is an 'endless' list, but with a UI that requires advancing the list by swiping pages sideways. Is this a request to have the list scroll up/down so it doesn't seem to have a 'pages' metaphor? I just think of it as an endless list and ignore the 'page breaks'. Or is the issue that you want a better task filter that filters by task rather than by page? Would you be ok with the current set-up but a better task filter that only shows the tasks by currently selected by the filter. You can get to the top/bottom of the list very quickly with the slider at the bottom; no need to go page-by-page.<br><br>Personally, I like the current setup because I don't want to have to pay attention to how far I am scrolling to make sure I don't miss any tasks. The current set-up makes that easy.<br><br>&gt; • Making the blue text color a readable shade of green instead. Blue is not readily associated with action, though red (for "urgent", "now", "stop", or "wait") and green (for "go", "ready", "active", or "today") are.<br><br>Ideally, the user could pick the 5 colors they wanted to have (I like blue, but I totally get your point)<br><br>&gt; Your time is valuable and you should be paid for your development efforts. A PayPal donation button added to your website would allow current owners of the app to support your development efforts (and Apple doesn't get 30% of that!).<br><br>Another idea is a very small kickstarter.com campaign. I'd be more likely to donate if I felt that the total donations would be enough to give the developer enough time/incentime to complete the changes needed.<br><br>For me, the key thing is BUG FIXES on the iPhone (I don't really use the web app)<br><br>Right now, the app is showing me the to-do list, but it says 'Pads' where it should say 'to-do', the button on the top left says 'edit' with no arrow shape, and no button on the right. I can't figure out how to get to my list of pads, Killing the process and restarting fixes the problem and now it says 'to-do' at the top. I have problems like this probably once a week, where I have to kill the process.<br><br>Sync must be fixed. My sync to the web doesn't work very quickly or reliably. You should have a SYNC NOW button so I know it is at least trying to sync. I have had the web page open for a while, with the iPhone settings slider to the left, and it has not updated, and I have restarted, etc.<br><br>You should have a TEST SYNC button in settings that checks whether the app can successfully log in to Google and sync so that I can test the sync without a computer.<br><br>There are a number of UI improvements that would make the app better, especially with the tickler, but I'll save that until I see that you're picking up the project again on an ongoing basis.<br><br>Thanks for FocusPad!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 July 2012 at 20:32 | Jonathan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Jonathan:<br><br>"Would you be ok with the current set-up but a better task filter that only shows the tasks by currently selected by the filter."<br><br>... No. But I would like everyone to have access to the pages style as a setting that can be toggled on or off.<br><br><br>"You can get to the top/bottom of the list very quickly with the slider at the bottom; no need to go page-by-page."<br><br>... The problem isn't getting to the beginning or end of one's list quickly using the pages style. That's only a problem for an endless-scrolling list. The problem with the pages style of FocusPad and FV is that scanning a large list of tasks from beginning to end multiple times a day, page-by-page, in a tiny visual-window is tedious and is not as natural or easy to do one-handed. Scrolling long top-to-bottom lists can be done one-handed with your thumb, or, holding the device in your left hand (assuming you're right-handed), you can flick the screen up or down with your right index finger using the natural up or down bend of your finger. It's exactly why I think Apple should add the option to "page" through your iOS device apps from top to bottom instead of left to right. It's far less fatiguing to the hand.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 July 2012 at 22:14 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I just submitted an update to Apple with the following changes:<br><br>* Search for a task.

This should not be very hard to do, since "long" pages are already supported. I like the idea, as it would make the app more broadly appealing to folks who don't like the page-based approach.  The feature would include the standard tapping of the status bar to scroll to top. Not sure about scroll to bottom.<br><br>* I added "choose colors for highlights" to my request list. <br><br>* Jonathan, please find me on the FocusPad mailing list so I can work with you to resolve your issues. A few other people have had the same issue as you regarding the Pads view, but I have so far been unable to reproduce it myself. Perhaps together we can find and slay this bug once and for all.<br><br>* Jonathan, I spent a lot of time making syncing fast and reliable, so I am surprised you are having issues. Your idea of a "sync test" button is a good one, and I will add it to the requests list. I have considered adding a sync now button before, but I am not sure it is necessary if sync is working properly. Specifically, as of the recent update the app will now sync whenever it is made visible, which for most people will be sufficient to show changes made in the web version.<br><br>* Thank you for your suggestions regarding Kickstarter and PayPal.
