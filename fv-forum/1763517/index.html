Testing FV now, and since my work is mainly project based, with projects that can last for weeks, I'm also interested at specific methods for project handling. For now, I just noted how in stress days I tend to break the method skipping the First unactioned item and going straight to my commitments. Infact, if I have a time consuming First unactioned item, I just can't think of completing it in such days. I mean, in more relaxed days it's a great pull to do things, and I already proved it to be a very good method, but it does not fit all my situations. So I was wandering if there should be some rules for particularly big tasks that cannot be broken down in chunks and how to deal with them.<br>Or maybe I should just delete the tasks that I can't deliver in some occasion and reinsert them at the end of the list. I don't like doing it though, I almost feel I'm cheating the system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>26 March 2012 at 8:39 | Lorenzo</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Hi Lorenzo,what is it that didn't work for you before FV?  It sounds like you were getting projects done just fine.  If so, you should continue to do so as you did before.  Use FV for the other stuff at other times.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>26 March 2012 at 13:24 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@ Lorenzo: &lt;&lt; Infact, if I have a time consuming First unactioned item, I just can't think of completing it in such days. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Remember that you don't have to complete a task at all in the first run. If you do, that's great! Otherwise, just do "little and often" to move the task towards completion.<br><br>Ciao.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>26 March 2012 at 14:31 | Stefano F. Rausch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Alan Baljeu<br>Hi Alan. Not exactely. I have used SuperFocus from last October, but I often broke it in the same manner: from time to time I have to face a project and dive in it really deep, that it means that I work 10-12 hours a day. In those situations I can't manage to follow no system at all, I just go with my pace. When times are more relaxed both systems has proven their strenghts, but I definitely prefer FV cause it forces me to consider all the list every cycle of actions and face the older items on the list. With SF I tended to stuck too much in one page, maybe because I wanted unconsciously to fulfill the page, I don't know. Also with SF I tended to let it go a bit when times were really calm, as if I thought I had all the time in the world so there was no need to follow the list. Off course that stagnation did not help me, putting me in bad attitude to do whatever thing I was planning.<br>A worst stop also happens typically when I finish a big project, as I feel a great emptyness (lack of adrenaline must have a part in it). Then, I slowly recover and in a week or so I can get back to rhythm, or not.<br>It's really hard for me, and it's not uncommon for freelances. I know other people that have similar problems.<br>It's too early to judge FV but for now I suspect it's way better for me then SF in a normal situation.<br>But I'd like to use it more extensively, also during hard pressure days. I'll keep trying.<br><br>@Stefano F. Rausch<br><br>You're right, but there are some tasks that just take much time and you can't work that way. ES go in some place relatively far, or visit some public office you know you'll spend an entire morning ecc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>26 March 2012 at 16:21 | Lorenzo</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@ Lorezo: I might be totally off-track here, however, your examples suggest that:<br><br>"If the first task on the list can't be done now for some valid reason (e.g. wrong time of day, precondition not met, bad weather), then cross it out and re-enter it at the end of the list. Use the next task as your starting benchmark."<br><br>should be applied in your situation. Same would be applicable when you are "deep" in a project. Your judgement in that moment is the correct one and hence you should follow your "inner voice" - as long as it is not a way to escape certain tasks ;)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>26 March 2012 at 21:48 | Stefano F. Rausch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Lorenzo<br><br>Also, remember that with FV, you almost always skip the first task on the list. It becomes the LAST thing you work on in the open chain of selected tasks.<br><br>If you get to the end of the chain and still can't work on it, that is the time when I would deal with it by putting a reminder in my calendar to pick it up when I'm likely to be free.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 March 2012 at 12:58 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Ha! You're perfectly right Stefano, I would have read better the rules.. but I hope to take further control of my projects too in the future with the help of FV or some other system. I'm sure there's a sort of training to use the method in the right way.<br>And thanks for the advice Will, I'm going to apply it the next time I have similar situation. At least that sound less like chating, there's a reason for such a decision and I'm not posponing arbitrarily.<br>So thank you both guys.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 March 2012 at 15:32 | Lorenzo</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Perhaps your situation may really require long stretches of absolutely committed concentrated work.<br><br>I used to think that way about my own work.  But Mark wrote somewhere about it, and how "little and often" really can be applied to most of these situations, and produce better results, with less frustration, less up-to-the-deadline last-minute pressure, and less burnout.<br><br>I didn't believe it at first, but having followed his systems for the last three years, I've come to believe he is correct.  <br><br>I suspect most of us who feel we "must" work in those marathon sessions are really fooling ourselves.   We are addicted to the "high" we feel when working in that mode, and the sense of accomplishment when we're done.  <br><br>Again, your situation might really be different, and I am not trying to second-guess you.   Just some food for thought.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>28 March 2012 at 23:49 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>This isn't intended to be a thread for answering questions, but since several people have tried to answer Lorenzo's concerns, I'll have a go to.<br><br>The simple answer is that if the first item on the list can't be done now (i.e. in the likely duration of the pre-select list) for any reason then it should be crossed out and re-entered at the end of the list. This is not cheating the system. it is specifically mentioned in the rules.<br><br>However it should be born in mind that most projects can have some preparatory work done on them, even if the main bulk has to be done in one go.<br><br>it should also be born in mind that the first item on the list is also the last one done in the preselect list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>31 March 2012 at 8:24 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Many thanks to everyone who has suggested questions.
