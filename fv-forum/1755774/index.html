Not individual pages on the list?<br>2) is the preselection list length predetermined? You seemed to be going for 3 or less items, but from the instructions it seem you just go to the end of the list, even if that means you preselect five or six tasks.<br><br>Thanks!<br>Tijl</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 7:57 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>You keep on preselecting a new task until there is "nothing" you want to do before the last preselected task. I'd say that strictly means until the end of the list. <br><br>However, when my FV list gets very long, I suspect I would stop preselecting after I "feel" there is "nothing" I want to do before the last preselected task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 9:59 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>With you there, Sabre, after a few hours of use, on paper for now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 10:21 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Tijl:<br><br>You use the entire list, yes. Pages are irrelevant to this system.<br><br>There's no limit to the number of tasks in the preselected list. Though if it gets too long you might not be using the selection method correctly. The question is carefully worded so you don't have to spend time weighting up every individual task. You can move quite rapidly through the list until a task hits you as something you want to do before the previous task.<br><br>If you don't go to the end of the list then you are in danger of missing out the more urgent tasks which tend to be found there.<br><br>Remember that it may take a little time to construct the preselected list, but once it's done you don't have to do any more scanning until it's been completed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 11:31 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>"Remember that it may take a little time to construct the preselected list, but once it's done you don't have to do any more scanning until it's been completed."<br><br>So the pre-selected list doesn't have to be completed in one go?

I suppose that could mean to write it down, put a dot on it, and restart the doing of dotted items from the end.

For example, first task and the last?<br>2) Sequence of tasks in a chain: surely consistently down according to the list? For example, there are 10 tasks    (№1... №10). I chose №1-№5-№10, and owe stop and make a chain?<br>And so: №1-№5-№10-№9-№3 it is wrong?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 19:04 | Sacherk</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Sacherk<br><br>How did you get 1-5-10-9-3 ?<br><br>The first chain would be 1-5-10 . If 9 is more important than 10, it would be 1-5-9-10 .<br><br>The second chain would start with the first unactioned item, 2. The next item more important than that is 3, then 9.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 20:48 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Note that Mark didn't mention the Common-Sense rule ("If it needs to be done now, do it now") in the FV description or Additional Tips section. But he did write: "If one or more very urgent things come up, write them at the end of the list and mark them with a dot so that they are done next. If something already on the list becomes very urgent, then move it to the end of the list and mark it with a dot in the same way." This is in the spirit of the Common-Sense rule, except the task does get entered, dotted, and crossed out.<br><br>So, since you're always working the chain bottom-up, you can hang a new urgent 'link' onto the bottom of the chain by appending a task to the list and dotting it.  If a task below the bottom link becomes urgent, but is not the last task on the list, I suppose you could just dot it and do it, rather than moving it all the way to the bottom first. . .</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 21:25 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Cricket, thanks, I tried today FV and understood the mistake.<br>I hurried up, asking the Main Issue of FV that the mixed chain from all my tasks for a week turned out! Down and up according to the list!<br>By the end of the working day I wanted to remain live :) therefore reconstructed the first chain strictly down according to the list (asking the Main Issue of FV).<br>The last task in the list entered into the first chain and I stopped and started to work upside-down.<br>I hope that is correct...<br>Though in the middle of the list there was a task which I wanted to solve before the last task in my list...<br>I was mistaken!<br>This task entered into the second chain, and is made.<br>And I by the end of the working day still live :).<br>Mark, I thank you, the system doesn't strain and WORKS!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 20:52 | Sacherk</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Annette:<br><br>&lt;&lt; So the pre-selected list doesn't have to be completed in one go?

You take SOME ACTION - as much or as little as you want - on each item.   When you are done taking action, if the item is not yet completed, then re-write it at the end of the list.<br><br>So, yes, you do work through each item.<br><br>But no, you don't need to COMPLETE each item -- just take ANY action, however small.<br><br>After you've taken action on each of the preselected items, you then do another round of preselection.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 5:29 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Hello, first post. Please help me get one question cleared up in my head:<br><br>1. You create the long list by writing down the tasks just as they pop up in your head; they are not sorted in any predetermined, structured manner<br>2. After starting with the first unactioned task, you obviously move down the list in order to find the next task to preselect<br>3. After finding the second task (which may be "unactioned task no 15" in the list), in order to preselect the third to-do task, do you only move downwards in the list, or do you start looking for tasks that you want to preselect, from the beginning of the list? I guess the second option would mess up the dot-markings, you'd have to use numbers instead, right?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 12:13 | Stratos Laspas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Stratos,<br><br>I think you keep going down, for the practical reason you mentioned about maintaining the order. My electronic version would in theory allow multiple passes of the main list, but in practice I find a single task works fine.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 12:23 | will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Always start at the beginning, go to the end, then stop.  Never go backwards when preselecting. When doing, always go backwards.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 12:25 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>To add to Alan's summary - the way I've been doing it, "always go backwards" means continually starting at the very end of the list.  In other words if two urgent (do it now!) things come up I write them at the end of the list and mark them. (If I'm in the middle of something I cross it out and re-write it at the end as well.)  I immediately begin at the end of the list and do these two things.  I then scan backwards through the list to find the next marked item.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 14:12 | Zane</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
