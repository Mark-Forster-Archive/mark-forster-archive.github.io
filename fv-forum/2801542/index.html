It challenges players to earn points, complete missions, or participate in matchups that reflect the players' historical performances. The ultimate reward? Some of the highest-rated cards in the game, including rare 99 OVR cards.<br><br><br><br><br>How to Get Started<br><br><br><br><br>To begin, navigate to the Postseason Past Program menu in MLB The Show 25's Diamond Dynasty. Here, you'll see a series of missions or challenges that are tied to specific past MLB seasons or players. These may include:<br><br><br><br><br>Mission Objectives: Complete tasks such as hitting home runs, striking out a certain number of batters, or stealing bases within a limited number of games.<br><br><br><br><br>Matchups: Play against CPU or online opponents in scenarios that replicate historical playoff moments.

These cards are extremely rare and powerful, often representing legendary hitters, pitchers, or two-way players from baseball history. Here's how to earn them:<br><br><br><br><br>Complete Milestone Objectives<br><br>Each Postseason Past Program typically has milestone objectives that track your progress across multiple missions. Reaching key milestones unlocks elite cards, and some of these milestones are directly tied to earning a 99 OVR player. Focus on completing all milestones for maximum rewards.<br><br><br><br><br>Finish Collections<br><br>Many 99 OVR cards are gated behind completing collections of other historic players. For instance, completing a set of past MVPs or World Series heroes might reward you with a top-tier card. Make sure to check the required cards for each collection and plan your gameplay accordingly.<br><br><br><br><br>Participate in Live Events<br><br>Some programs include live-event challenges, where completing specific tasks in real-time matches contributes to program points. Consistently participating in these events can accelerate your path to 99 OVR rewards.<br><br><br><br><br>Use Program Tokens Efficiently<br><br>As you complete missions and matchups, you'll earn program tokens. These tokens can be redeemed for packs or specific player cards within the Postseason Past Program. Prioritize using tokens on rewards that contribute toward 99 OVR cards rather than on smaller, incremental prizes.<br><br><br><br><br>Additional Rewards and Benefits<br><br><br><br><br>While 99 OVR cards are the headline feature, the Postseason Past Program also offers a wealth of other valuable rewards. These include:<br><br><br><br><br>High-Rated Players: Even if you don't earn a 99 OVR card immediately, the program gives access to elite players in the 90–98 OVR range, which can immediately improve your lineup.<br><br><br><br><br>Equipment Packs: Some milestones reward you with exclusive bats, gloves, or pitching gear that boosts player stats and improves performance in Diamond Dynasty.<br><br><br><br><br>Program Tokens and Points: Accumulating these allows for additional pulls from the program's reward pool, giving you a chance to collect multiple elite cards.<br><br><br><br><br>Stubs and Packs: Completing missions often grants Stubs (the in-game currency) or packs that can be opened for additional valuable rewards.<br><br><br><br><br>Tips to Maximize Your Progress<br><br><br><br><br>Prioritize Easier Objectives First: Focus on missions you can complete quickly to accumulate points and tokens efficiently. This builds a foundation for tackling more challenging objectives later.<br><br><br><br><br>Leverage Player Abilities: Use historic players in your lineup who have abilities that align with the program's objectives. For example, if a mission requires multiple stolen bases, insert players with high speed and base-stealing traits.<br><br><br><br><br>Plan for Collections: Review the program's collection requirements in advance. Acquiring certain cards early can make it easier to complete larger sets and unlock milestone rewards.<br><br><br><br><br>Consistency is Key: Postseason Past Program progress is cumulative. Play daily, complete missions, and participate in matchups regularly to steadily advance toward elite rewards.<br><br><br><br><br>Conclusion<br><br><br><br><br>The MLB The Show 25 Postseason Past Program offers a unique way to engage with baseball history while earning some of the game's most powerful rewards. By understanding the program's objectives, focusing on milestone achievements, and strategically using tokens and collections, players can earn 99 OVR cards that elevate their Diamond Dynasty roster.<br><br><br><br><br>Beyond the 99 OVR players, the program provides additional elite rewards, including high-rated players, equipment, Stubs, and packs.
