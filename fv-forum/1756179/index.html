I used the first few AF systems and then my life took a strange turn and I wasn't using anything basically. But I'm at a place where I can and want to get back into a good system. I've been working with it this morning and I can see the power of it.<br><br>One question: What about checklists?<br><br>I know it is mentioned, and I have a number of things that I can best track on daily and weekly checklists. But I'm a bit fuzzy so far on how they actually intersect with FV.<br><br>For now I'm staying on paper (I appreciate the physical act of drawing a line through the item) which makes effectively using checklists very helpful in cutting down on the clutter of the paper list.<br><br>Thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 16:57 | RevDave</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Checklists are usually about a particular topic. I've had sucess simply adding the title of my checklist to the list and treating it like any other thing that needs my attention. If I don't finish the checklist I add to the end of the list, knowing that I'll see it again eveytime I scan my list. I can trust my sense of incompletion to raise the urgency of it to the point of where I'll want to work on it . If not I'll get to it eventually just by moving down the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 17:10 | Tom L.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I use checklists too for tasks that repeat daily or weekly.  I print them out and insert in sheet protectors (one for each day of the week,) and then I checkoff items with a dry erase marker.  I really like Tom L.'s method of listing the checklist title on the master list.  I think I'll give that a try.  I've just been doing the checklists separate from the regular list, keeping them separated as one is "routines" and the other misc. things to do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 19:04 | Kim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Tom L.'s method is brilliant. I make extensive use of checklists (CLs), two to five per day, triggered by time of day or change in location (work &lt;-&gt; home).  See right side of<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62110063/Photo%20Feb%2013%2C%2014%2016%2050.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62110063/Photo%20Feb%2013%2C%2014%2016%2050.jpg</a><br><br>for an example. I normally work through all, or at least several, of the items in each CL in one short block of time.  So I can stay in the FV flow by adding, e.g., CLmo1, CLmo2, etc. (for Monday's CLs) to the FV list and dotting and doing them at the right time. If I don't tick off all the items from a CL in one session, I can reenter its title and dot-then-do it later.<br><br>Thanks for the tip, Tom!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 20:23 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Thanks for the pictorial example Ubi - it makes all the difference.

Gawande write superbly and has at least two other books about medical practices, eminently readable by the layman.<br><br>Checklists are great, not 100% foolproof as I discovered when I reached my current assignment in Africa on Saturday night, but still better than my sieve-like brain.<br><br>One of the first items on my first FV list today was: "ERRAND: get spectacles lens cleaner, top up mobile phone.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>13 March 2012 at 21:29 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>In addition to the other comments, note that Mark's systems (which I suppose includes FV) are generally intended to manage one's discretionary time -- NOT your scheduled or pre-committed time.   <br><br>So, if you have a morning checklist, or a "to do on arrival at work" checklist, or a "close up shop" checklist, those would be managed outside the FV list and performed at the appropriate scheduled time.<br><br>Tom L's method works great for those items that ARE managed during your discretionary time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 6:06 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim,<br>My experience confirms that validity of your point. SF incorporated my morning routine without skipping a beat. This morning (before I read your post) I stipulated that I was in nondiscretionary mode, hence, non-FV mode. What I found is that I can use one list, but use it in different modes.<br>So, I went to the top of yesterday's list, where I started my morning routine yesterday. Once I am done with my morning routine, I will enter discretionary FV mode.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 12:22 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Great post - this is just what I've been wondering about.  I wanted to know in what contexts others use FV.  Ubi - great photo!  Thanks for that, it's fascinating to see how others create their lists and systems, gives me ideas and Roger J - I'm going to check out Atul Gawande.  I like structure but wanted the freedom and flow everyone has been talking about from the FV list.  Thanks for all the great tips everyone.  I plan to incorporate FV in to my discretionary time, which I did for a while but realised I was making my chains too long. I ended up just referencing the list just like a master list and writing out the tasks on a seperate sheet of paper to prevent myself feeling overwhelmed.  Obviously this is a method that could be used for the FV but I think it is a bit disjointed.  Now I feel I have ideas to really make the FV part of my own system and use it to its full potential.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>12 July 2012 at 6:35 | Debbie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I've stopped using paper for FV and my routine checklists.  I use the Clear app for iPhone for everything now. For each checklist, I list each item with a leading number, then swipe-right to 'check' it off. That way, if I do the checklist out of order, I can put the items back in order quickly when I do my end-of-day Reset (by touch-hold-drag).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>12 July 2012 at 19:01 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>For the first time in a very long while, I feel like I've had a truly productive day. Not just busy, but doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I've been using FV—and realizing it's better than anything else I've ever tried—but I still wasn't spending my time in the right way.<br><br>This "checklist" post changed all that. I bought the book and started reading it last night, made some checklists in Clear, and am off and running.<br><br>So, thanks to everyone who posted on this thread.

Nice.
