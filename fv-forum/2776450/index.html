Seeing that many of you seem to have been around here for a while, I was hoping that I could get some pointers in my attempts to apply some of Mark’s suggestions. I’m taking classes full-time and working part-time, both remotely. I don’t know how special my situation is, but besides scheduled classes/meetings, I’m struggling to manage my “discretionary time.” My tasks fall into a few categories:<br><br>•	School work, some with associated deadlines.<br>•	Paid work of which I need to do a certain number of hours each week.<br>•	Personal tasks like house chores<br>•	Recurring daily-ish tasks like exercise<br>•	Leisure tasks like playing video games.<br><br>This is the strategy I’ve tried for the past few weeks:<br>1.	For recurring tasks, I’ve scheduled them into my calendar. If I end up missing it, then I just forget about it. <br>2.	For the other tasks, I’ve maintained a separate to-do list for each category, so a “school” list, a “work” list, etc. I had 5 lists (I have 2 part-time jobs). I used FVP to work through them. I know this is against Mark’s recommendation, but it seemed to be the best way to do it given that…<br>3.	I tried implementing the “school timetable” schedule which Mark recommended for stay-at-home workers.  To ensure that I fulfilled the hours for paid work, I designated afternoons for work. To simulate office workers’ “work” for the other hours, I designated mornings for school work. I scheduled my computer to shut down automatically at the beginning and end of each work period to ensure I stopped whatever I was doing before and ended work on the dot, as Mark suggested.<br>4.	Personal and leisure tasks were left off the schedule. I tried scheduling additional time for personal tasks, but it never worked.<br><br>What worked:<br>1.	I had started early on a school assignment and submitted it hours before the deadline. This is a big deal for me, since I usually submit assignments last minute, sometimes literally.<br>2.	I kept up on my hours for my part-time jobs and felt the serenity that comes when I’m certain that I’ll fulfill the hours instead of worrying about fulfilling them.<br>3.	Within one list, I felt freer than when I used a system that dictated a certain order. I could get multiple things moving.<br>4.	I never felt I worked too long in one session since there were (tech-enforced) scheduled breaks. Knowing that also made me resist work less.<br><br>Problems I encountered:<br>1.	I kept missing recurring tasks scheduled at the beginning of the day because I would sometimes wake up late. This made me feel guilty.<br>2.	I would oftentimes miss recurring tasks scheduled for the middle of the day because:<br>a.	I would feel I scheduled too many tasks during my two-hour lunch break, leaving me feeling like I was rushing to get through all the tasks rather than feeling rejuvenated.<br>b.	I would occasionally go shopping or out for lunch with my brother. It’s really the nicest time to go out.<br>3.	While I was pretty consistent in doing recurring tasks scheduled for the end of the day, it would often feel like I was going against my “psychological readiness” (aka I felt too tired to do it but did it anyways).<br>4.	As Mark probably foresaw, whenever I worked on one of my lists, I would be afraid that I was missing something important on another list. <br>5.	Since I never scheduled a time to do personal tasks, my personal list fell by the wayside, with consequences on my home environment. I used all my non-scheduled time on leisure (video games and Internet).<br>6.	One-off meetings became a headache. I would need to remember to turn off the auto-shutdowns to prevent my computer shutting down during the meeting. I would need to remember to turn them back on to continue my schedule. After the meeting, I would need to think about how long of a break I should take to make up for any break times the meeting took away. If I was tired and didn’t want to calculate that, I just took a long break until lunch time.<br>7.	If I woke up late and missed one or two work sessions, I would feel discouraged and waste the whole morning. I think this is partly because the breaks are of uneven lengths, so I feel like I would be indulging in too long of a break if I take the 30-minute break without doing the first work session, and I would be working too much if I do the 3rd and 4th sessions and only get a 10-minute break in between. I have funny thoughts.<br>8.	Generally feeling somewhat trapped by the schedule and my slew of auto-shutdowns and feeling like the system is a burden to maintain.<br><br>I have tried to solve this on my own to no avail. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 November 2020 at 10:28 | Charles</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Charles:<br><br>It sounds as if you've overcomplicated things. <br><br>The school timetable only works if you get to school on time! If you can't guarantee that then you'd be better off with a more flexible schedule.<br><br>This is how I'd do it.<br><br>I would only use set times for things that occur at set times, e.g. Zoom calls, meals, appointments, etc.<br><br>I would use one list for everything (including personal and recreational stuff), and use something like FVP to work through the tasks in the best order.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 November 2020 at 13:26 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Thank you Mark! I've been trying out what you've suggested. While it feels a lot more free/flexible, I am finding that it can be quite difficult to bring myself to get started on the list. When I sit down at the desk I often default to time-wasting activities like surfing the web and chatting with people online.<br><br>I have tried a few solutions:<br><br>- doing tasks in 10-minute increments (set timer). This was effective in getting me started, but it became a little frustrating when I finished a task before 10 minutes is up and only worked on another task for like 2-3 minutes and was interrupted. I also started doing 10-minutes of work and 10-minutes of break, which made it seem like it would take a long time to fulfill 7 hours of work for example, and that it'd be filled with many interruptions.<br><br>- attempting to do 30-minutes of work and 10-minutes of break. I could not get started on the first 30 minutes because committing to work 30-minutes seemed daunting.<br><br>- not timing work/break times and just selecting break activities through the FVP algorithm, doing things for as long as I felt like it and no longer. It was still difficult to bring myself to the list. If I succeeding in working the list, once I chose a task like chatting with people online, I found it difficult to stop even when I felt like it.<br><br>- easing the fear of all work and no play by guaranteeing myself free time around meal times and before bed, but today for example I missed my morning break time and wasted the morning again. I guess I really can't rely on anything involving set times in the morning.<br><br>Maybe I'm overcomplicating things again and it's actually quite simple? My apologies for being obtuse. I would again greatly appreciate any pointers.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 November 2020 at 22:17 | Charles</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Charles:<br><br>Here are two (out of many) possible ways to overcome your problems. They can be used together or separately.<br><br>1) If you use FVP, start the day by re-prioritising. This way your first few tasks in the morning should be relatively easy ones.<br><br>2) Try the pyramid method to work on your tasks. Using a timer, work for one minute on your task. Then set your timer for two minutes and continue (without a break) to work on the task. Then work for three minutes, then four - and so on for as long as you can. When you can't go any further, you then have to work back down to zero in the same way as you worked up. For example, if you work up to 10 minutes and then come back down again, you will have worked a total of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 1hr 40 minutes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 November 2020 at 21:16 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
