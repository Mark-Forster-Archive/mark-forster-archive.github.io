The bottom half is entirely things that aren't due yet -- easy to scan. My old weekly list is my first FV page, so weekly tasks are getting a lot of attention right now. That would be different if it were in the middle, though I'd still benefit from seeing all the weekly tasks in one place and knowing if I were keeping up.<br><br>However, maintaining those sub-lists would be a tweak to FV. Mark has asked that we not tweak the system for a while, so instead of my old way of writing the recurrence at the bottom of the sub-list, I'll write it at the end of the big list. It's easy enough to go back if it doesn't work, and chances are it will work just fine.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 March 2012 at 14:18 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I love the scan through the list as well, which for me is a long list --still north of 450 items-- for every task I do, two more take its place :).<br><br>I don't think it takes more than 3 minutes to do a scan.

I am given to understand a long list also works.&gt;&gt;<br><br>These are some very good points; "cleaning up" the list is a dilemma for me.  <br><br>Looking at extremes, if you clean it up too much, what do you have?  You certainly don't have much of an MF-FV System anymore.  If you don't clean it up at all, then there's a chance of really important and urgent items being buried and too many un-actionable  items (I know this is debatable).  <br><br>I like to think back at when I had too many side lists, or too many someday's.  Then, the out-of-sight-out-of-mind (OSOM) effect kicked in and I just ignored them, and worst of all, they created clutter (both physically and mentally).<br><br>There must be some sort of middle ground for tasks.  I remember that dragging related tasks onto each other in OmniFocus simply makes sub-tasks out of them.  Of course, everybody knows this, but the point is that once you collapse these groups, the rest of your list is shorter and more manageable, and the other important and urgent items stand out faster.  Also, seeing the items grouped is healthy in some cases because it gives perspective and helps with sequence/prerequisites.  <br><br>I also don't want to be forced to re-write too many un-doable tasks at the end. &nbsp;(Being "out of context" is a whole other (but related) issue.)<br><br>One time Jupiter came up with a Current Project List (CPL).  A separate list of projects would act as a good reminder and allow you to scribble notes, priorities, symbols, etc. on it.  Treat it like a checklist or whatever; the main thing is you wouldn't forget.<br><br>A CPL might also be useful to remind you of the different "places" things are, both digitally (OneNote, EverNote, Omni, etc.) and on paper (notebooks, folders, in FV, etc.).<br><br>On the other hand, I also liked nuntym's simple suggestion in the "Someday, Maybe" thread (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1757306">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1757306</a> ): "Cross out the item you want to dismiss but add something to distinguish it from a deleted item. In my practice I place a "D" at the end." <br><br>So, I think the answer for "the other things" lies somewhere in the grey area of "when you +really+ need to do something to make your system more effective," but always trying to keep moving un-done tasks out to a minimum (and avoiding coming up with yet other ways to complicate your system).  <br><br>Some of these "other things" could include: <br> - the things Alan mentioned (projects, tickler (scheduled/time blocks), routines (and checklists)),<br> - contexts (people, out-and-about, waiting-for, etc.), and <br> - the dreaded someday/maybe's.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 March 2012 at 16:23 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Bernie:<br><br>&lt;&lt; ... complete with procrastinating by going to the bathroom, weeding the garden, and verifying that no light bulbs need changing. &gt;&gt;<br><br>ROFL!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 March 2012 at 16:44 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>vegheadjones wrote:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I love the scan through the list as well, which for me is a long list --still north of 450 items-- for every task I do, two more take its place :).   ...

With the first question I had to pause at each item and ask the question. With the second I could just zoom down the list until something caught my eye. Basically i was assuming that I didn't want to do anything before x unless something thrust itself into my consciousness.<br><br>I suspect those who are worried about the length of time a scan takes may be interpreting the second question as if it were the first.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>17 March 2012 at 0:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I've read the rules and nearly all of the FV Forum and never picked up on this!  I was asking "Do I want to do this before x?"   The couple of times I found myself thinking of what I wanted to do before X and "corrected" myself.  <br><br>While they are very similar, they have very different feel and speed as Mark notes.  So FV might be even better than I thought now that I know the right question.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>17 March 2012 at 1:26 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@vegheadjones:<br><br>I think I now realize why it's taking me so long.   I find I am frequently rewriting the tasks to make it easier to quickly assess the "what do I want to do before X?" question.   <br><br>The way I have these set up in OneNote currently doesn't make it very easy to scan so quickly.   A lot of the items are just emails sent to OneNote, or web pages sent to OneNote, and the title of the item is not always very clear, forcing me to glance at the contents of the item.  When I was pausing on each one and assessing whether it "stood out", this was fine.  But for the much quicker "do before?" question, there's no time to glance at the contents if I intend to move quickly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>17 March 2012 at 2:51 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark,<br>&lt;&lt;"Do I want to do this before x?" ... "What do I want to do before I do x?"&gt;&gt;<br><br>I completely missed that! Now that I think about it, I did begin with the second wording and it did result in my scanning the list quickly for a stand-out as you described. But by now I've inadvertently shifted to considering each item and applying the first wording, which has still been pretty quick.<br><br>Thanks for pointing out the distinction.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>17 March 2012 at 6:28 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim: edit the titles, for clarity!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>17 March 2012 at 13:39 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I don't edit the titles for clarity, during the input process, that would slow me down too much, or during the scan process.

Those old habits are hard to break. Early days yet, and those numbers might change, but those are my current warning signs -- not goals, not targets, not maximums, just warning signs that I might have reverted. If I think I have, the only solution is erase all the dots and start over. I've only done it once (probably should have done it several times), and found not only did I choose fewer items, I chose different ones -- a sure sign I was asking the wrong question.<br><br>Sometimes I need to ask myself, "How badly do I want to do Y before X?" If it's just a little, I call it measurement error and don't dot it.<br><br>Note: As near as I can tell, Mark doesn't want to put a maximum size on the list.

Nevertheless, I do suggest that you do finish scanning the rest of the list, as a visual feedback for what is still on the plate. It doesn't hurt and you might compile the next preselection even faster.<br><br>Keep in mind that various internal and external factors do influence the way you do preselect the tasks, even if you are not actively aware of it.

But it still ends up creating many nuanced comparisons.  <br><br>Let's say my list is ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVQXYZ.<br><br>I put a dot next to A.  Then I scan for "what do I want to do before A?"   Let's say A is a major work-related task that I've been resisting.  OK, my mind is now thinking about "work" and "I don't want to do this, almost anything else would be better to do first".   So I find myself preselecting B.<br><br>Now I scan for "what do I want to do before B?"   Let's say B is a personal phone call, but I'm on work time, so I really should be avoiding personal items.  C is a moderately challenging work item with little resistance.   I want to do it before B, since I'm in "working mode".  So I put a dot next to C.   <br><br>I scan now for "what do I want to do before C?"    I get all the way to K before I find something.  Let's say K is some really urgent work task, but to do it at all, I need to spend half an hour on it.   And let's say K reminds me of a bunch of tasks related to IT that I need to deal with.   K gets a dot.  And now I'm primed to be thinking about my IT-related tasks.<br><br>I find P, which is also IT-related, and I want to do it before K.   P is a very interesting article that I've been wanting to read, and it will actually help me finish K more effectively, and will only take 5 minutes.   So P gets a dot.<br><br>But now I'm thinking about other things I'd like to read, and am not really thinking so much about urgent IT tasks any more.   I find T and am about to dot it, because I want to read it very much, and probably before P.  But now I realize I am taking too long to do this preselection and have already got plenty of urgent tasks to accomplish.  Need to get started already!!   So I decide to add "get started now!!" to the end and dot it.  And get the preselection taken care of!!<br><br>Anyway, this is a little exaggerated but that's how my comparisons happen sometimes.  It would be really hard to make a case that T &gt; P &gt; K &gt; C &gt; B &gt; A, where "&gt;" equates to some uniform criterion.   In reality, it actually means something slightly different in each comparison.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 March 2012 at 22:25 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>But that's kind of irrelevant, you have a list of stuff that needs doing and you're just selecting a subset of stuff that you think needs doing first.<br><br>This (to me) needless what-if-ism is just unproductive nit-picking. Does FV produce an optimal ordering of tasks based on some uniform criterion? No. But who said you have to have a uniform criterion at all. Pick a few tasks and JFDI.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 March 2012 at 22:41 | Ed</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim:<br><br>I kind of agree with Ed. You're putting far too much thought into this. I would just have dotted A, then whammed down the list until I found something that was mentally flashing a red stop light at me, and so on to the end. Your aim is not to produce an optimal ordering (as if such a thing exists) but to construct a ladder which leads you into getting A done (and hopefully getting quite a bit of useful work done on the way).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 March 2012 at 23:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Good feedback, Mark and Ed, thanks!   Actually I'm not putting much conscious thought into the decision process at all -- this is simply the mental process that "happens" when I ask the "what do I want to do before X?"  question.   This is just the way my mind works.  LOL     <br><br>I'll try to wham down the list looking for that red light.   Maybe I'll rephrase the question:  "what do I REALLY REALLY want to do before X?"   or   "what have I just GOT to do before I do X?"  to prevent me from leaning too much in the other direction:  "what do I sorta maybe might want to do before X?"   since that seems to be what I'm doing.   :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 March 2012 at 1:09 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim,<br><br>I have experienced the same wandering focus while preselecting tasks, in that once I've dotted something quick and fun, then the fun has driven from my mind the urgencies I dotted earlier, so I end up dotting things that I don't want to do before the original benchmark, even though I might want to do them (in a vacuum) before the fun thing.<br><br>The key phrase is "in a vacuum." I've solved this by reminding myself that "what I want to do before x" is not to be construed in a vacuum, but in the context of this morning, with the amount of time I have right now before the next thing on my schedule. If I've made a long chain, it helps to pause and remind myself of some of the more urgent things on it. It is important not to turn this into a rational sorting exercise, just to keep my current schedule and situation as an intuitive frame of reference.<br><br>I think this problem will seem completely alien to some people, but obviously not to you and me! Fortunately, I've had really great success with my little method.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 March 2012 at 2:43 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Bernie - <br><br>&lt;&lt;seem completely alien to some people&gt;&gt;<br><br>Nope, I struggle with answering the "what do I want..." question as well. I don't have trouble with the first unactioned task on the list (the oldest one). Mainly because "What do I want to do before I do x?" is almost anything :) Things/thoughts become more obscure with the 2nd &amp; 3rd benchmark.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 March 2012 at 3:42 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>avrum:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Mainly because "What do I want to do before I do x?" is almost anything :) Things/thoughts become more obscure with the 2nd &amp; 3rd benchmark &gt;&gt;<br><br>And that results in your getting the first and second tasks on the list done, plus a few more urgent and/or less resistible tasks. That's what's supposed to happen though it's not a rigid thing apart from the first task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 March 2012 at 7:13 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Regarding cleaning up the list to keep it to a reasonable size, I put anything that isn't urgent and I probably won't have time to look at in the next week or two into Google Calendar, with an email reminder set.  I pick a day, fairly roughly, closer to when I think I'll have time to do something about it.  When I get the email reminder, I put the task on the list.<br><br>So Google Calendar functions as a kind of tickler file, or someday list - nothing gets forgotten entirely, because eventually Google will remind me about it, and then I either put it on the list so I can do it or I decide to scrap it completely.<br><br>What remains in my list are tasks that I intend to do something about in the next couple of weeks or so.  That includes no more than the next couple of actions for mutli-task projects.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 March 2012 at 9:38 | Annette</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Annette,<br><br>I am using Wunderlist and what I do for tasks which I don't want to see in the immediate future is create a separate list called Deferred/Waiting. I put a date when I might want to get to it and then it shows up with a Due badge on that day. Very similar to using the Calendar for a tickler.<br><br>I also put items which I'm waiting for a response on that list as well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 March 2012 at 10:43 | Shak</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Taking the "wham down the list looking for that red light" approach, I'm finding that each preselection batch tends to follow a "theme".  <br><br>For example, if the first item is a "fun" item, then I tend to find other "fun" or "light" items.   I end up choosing a handful of those, and get them done.<br><br>The next time around is more of an "administrivia round".<br><br>The next round is more "odds and ends that push some projects forward".<br><br>Interesting.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 March 2012 at 23:31 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim:<br><br>Yes, that matches my exerience though I think my list is much shorter than yours.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 March 2012 at 2:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Yep, I too find myself doing the preselection more or less according to a theme. Also works nicely to keep the preselection to a reasonable size.<br><br>I'm still amazed after a week how well this system works to keep me from procrastinating. Although my list is still huge (&gt;300 tasks), it's decreasing steadily and I'm not feeling overwhelmed by it anymore.
