I’ve also been using an app called “Daily Routine” to keep my morning/evening routines going at a clip, and to block time in the evenings for high importance, low urgency stuff.  And that’s what I wanted to ask about.<br><br>I have identified a number of “areas of continual improvement/activity” – fitness, reading, writing, (self taught) piano, programming skills, etc.  For each area, each day I make a note like “Read to page 300 of x book”, “14min HIIT workout 30s/60s”.  I have lists – a list of books to read, programming books, piano books – but no thought out order or dates attached.  I've read the thread about using some AF techniques on a book list, but I'm contemplating something more detailed than that.<br><br>I’m tempted to try to motivate myself by planning these things out.  I could put where I expect to be each day or week – pages/books to read, pieces to practice/memorize etc.  I know that it’s kind of a waste of time, since plans will always change and it’s hard to anticipate how long it will take to read a book or learn a piece of music.  On the other hand, it’s motivating to have goals, and might keep me from falling behind or skipping days when I’m tired.  It’s also nice to have an estimate of how much you can accomplish.  For piano, having weekly goals would provide some of the motivation of having lessons, and would ensure I balance repertoire with theory and technic, etc.  I feel like, without specific goals, it doesn’t matter how much or how little I get done, and I don’t feel like I know where I’m going.<br><br>If you do this, how detailed do you go? For reading, would you shoot for “these 20 books by the end of the year” or “Book A finished on date b, book c finished on date d…” or “Page 201 by Friday”?  And how far out would you go?<br><br>Am I crazy?  Is planning like this a total waste?  Does anyone else at least get the urge to do this, even if they don't do it?  Anything else to "satisfy the urge" of planning?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>9 July 2013 at 18:05 | Katie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Meant to post this in General, not FV, sorry!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>9 July 2013 at 18:06 | Katie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I get caught in this all the time. I have so many things that Little-and-Often would be great for, and it's only an extra 15 minutes 3 times a week. Surely I can fit it in! And I like milestones -- but usually watch personal ones slide by.<br><br>You're spread out over a large number of projects. How much time will it take to meet all those weekly goals?<br><br>Some of your projects, especially reading, might work better if fewer are done at once. Read just one book this week, rather than a chapter in each of five. Focus on repertoire one week and technique the next.<br><br>Benefits of Fewer Projects at Once:<br><br>- Less time spent switching mental state.<br><br>- Easier to organize and decide what to do.<br><br>- Reach more goals sooner. ABCABCABC finishes the final project in 9 days, but you don't finish anything until day 7. AAABBBCCC finishes something on day 3.<br><br>- When you slip behind, you're only behind in a few things or missing a few checkmarks rather than several. (Yes, you start the next projects later, but it doesn't stare you in the face each time you look at your list. You said these were self-improvement projects, not things others depend on.)<br><br>- Tidier desk. It's hard to put things away when I'll just have to spread it all out again tomorrow.<br><br>You could set external deadlines for one or two projects. Maybe sign up for a race. That might get you past the worst part of the exercise habit.<br><br>I reward myself when I reach a goal, even if I'm late. Otherwise, not only do I feel bad about missing the date, I also feel bad when I reach the goal and remember I can't get the reward.<br><br>Even things that benefit from little-and-often can benefit from a longer "intense / less-intense" cycle. Work hard before a race or exam, and maintenance mode the rest of the time.<br><br>Having said all that, it's still a problem for me. Every time I start to pull ahead, I think I've got this procrastination thing mastered, take on more, and then realize the only reason I pulled ahead was I had two weeks in a row with fewer than usual external events.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>9 July 2013 at 21:51 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Thanks, Cricket.  I like the idea of focusing on a subset of projects and cycling around.  Or even focusing on a group of projects for the week, but one project per day, instead of trying to work 15 minutes on each thing, which can be pretty unproductive.<br><br>I've been thinking about it, and I think I'll write out weekly goals in each area, and let time / external events / desire allocate time during the week.  Managing without micromanaging.  Only looking a week ahead, you should know roughly how much time you have.  Eg. next week I'm out of town three days so won't be playing piano, but will have lots of time in the air to read, so I might shoot to finish the book I'm reading by the end of the week, and practice piano just a little on the weekend.<br><br>The idea of weekly goals is so not new - funny how you come back to the classics when you try to reinvent the wheel :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>11 July 2013 at 15:53 | Katie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Get It Done Guy, aka Stever Robbins, suggested pick one theme for each day: Focus, Admin and Spirit.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=z2QfnvktmiEC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=get+it+done+guy+focus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GUXO0JYV8l&amp;sig=ZC8LP5b5G8QiutnTmVlTvGyiavM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgjkUbr8D6S7ygGppoCwBQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCA">http://books.google.ca/books?id=z2QfnvktmiEC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=get+it+done+guy+focus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GUXO0JYV8l&amp;sig=ZC8LP5b5G8QiutnTmVlTvGyiavM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgjkUbr8D6S7ygGppoCwBQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCA</a><br><br>Focus requires you to focus, and is often a project that moves you forward. Admin is often maintenance tasks, including paperwork and cleaning. Spirit time nourishes us.<br><br>Some tasks could fit in several categories; it depends on the person and day. A professional novelist with a contract would consider plotting the next book a focus task. If you're writing the book purely for enjoyment with no deadline, it might be a spirit task. Preparing a budget could be in any category. If you do it often, the grunt-work of assembling the numbers is admin, but if you do it rarely it needs focus. A back-of-the-envelope calculation to see if you can quit work would be spirit.<br><br>It seems to work better than a bit of each type of work each day.<br><br>It's even more powerful if you can take advantage of natural cycles (weather, travel, hormones, month-end overtime, exhaustion from month-end overtime). I'm terrible at predicting, but often see it in hindsight. "No wonder I couldn't focus!" or "It was absolutely worth pushing past the inertia and working on that project today!"<br><br>Reading while traveling is a great idea. Guilt-free spirit reading, and those books you "should" read but never get around to. What about music theory? Many smart-phones have a piano app which is good enough to hear the scales, intervals and chords you're writing on paper. (I'm jealous. You pianists see and hear chords and intervals every time you practise. Us vocalists can only make one note at a time, and even when we split the chord we're likely to be off-pitch!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 July 2013 at 16:04 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 books this year or page 201 by friday or book finished by July 3 may take away from the pleasure of reading. be hard to set up goals as hard to be accurate in forecast. books vary in length, difficulty/speed to read and of course mood/energy of reader.<br><br>so what to do? could just have goal of read. but we know that does not give control of actually doing it or any goal to reach for.<br><br>instead try read for 1 hour every day, or 10-11pm. and depending on how flexible your day, could say read for about 1 hour starting at 10pm (allows to end at where you want to end, such as end of chapter, vs hard stop at 10pm, but keeps you from going to 2am)<br><br>this gives a solid structure, that works with what the nature of reading.<br>also, to give even more of a sense of after doing accomplishment, could still keep a list of books you have read.<br><br>fine, this is great for pleasure reading, what about the books I need to read for degree?<br>same idea, just figure out how many chapters need to read and when need them finished. 7 chapters, need in a week. so after some experimenting, will know it takes you about 1 hour per chapter. so give it 1 week and you are done. if 2 hours a chapter then need to spend 2 hours per day reading to get it done in a week OR adjust and next time give 2 weeks to get it done.<br><br>of course as said in 1st section, you may not know how long it takes to finish. so build in excess flex at the start. later you may be far more perfect in knowing how long takes to read biology text vs math text and can plan accordingly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 July 2013 at 0:03 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>several areas of improvement<br><br>fitness, reading, programming<br><br>spend 1 hour each day<br><br>but, wait, these are extra, and I don't have 1 hour extra each day<br><br>OK, then 20 minutes each day<br>nah, too small a time slice<br><br>OK, 1 hour each day on one activity, then tomorrow, 2nd activity then 3rd<br>keep cycling<br><br>OR perhaps some kind of logic<br><br>Mon Wed Fri 1 hour fitness (fitness often is this way)<br>Sat Sun read (weekend pleasure)<br>Tue Thu program (weekdays, work related)<br><br>for all of these, track what DID after DID<br>and make that in nested chunks<br><br>read 2 chapters of Javascript for beginners got done TODAY<br>read Javascript book AND HTML book did this WEEK<br>learned how to build web site and built one for my artist friend YEAR<br><br>this keeps giving sense of accomplishment<br><br>can also use this going forward to plan, but again, not exact structure as may not know how long take to learn, or how long take to be able to run a certain distance in a certain time<br><br>so: goal is to hit 7 minute mile.<br>learn how to make a web site and build one for a real person real use<br>read for pleasure about ancient Japan<br>for all of these, keep going until do reach</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 July 2013 at 0:15 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Katie -- I've tried to do personal projects as you've described your plans, and they tend to crash and burn for me. I think because they made so much intellectual sense (x pgs/day, x lbs lost by end of month) that of course they should work. But they did not always take into account my emotional needs, personality, or emergencies. And so those goals became clubs for me to beat myself over the head with rather than inspire me to perform.<br><br>When I've tried to read x number of pages of a book, I would typically stick little post-its at the start of the next 5 chapters or every 10 pages or so, so that I could visually gauge how much I'd be reading that night. So the book was out and primed to be read, but it wasn't a task on the list. I've since just started reading (for pleasure) until I get distracted, in which case I'm tired or have lost interest; of course, if this was reading for work or a school project, I'd be more rigorous and have more specific goals for the text that would spur me on. <br><br>I'm trying to focus more on process than results. For example, I take banjo lessons and it may take me months to learn to play something. The key is to practice regularly (process) and the song will take care of itself (result). If I'm only noticing the poor fingering or skipped notes (the result), then I start getting tense and angry with myself. If I see what I'm doing as just part of the learning process and have faith that I'll get there in the end, then I can relax.<br><br>With exercise, I have a routine I do 3 days/wk and I track my pulse rate 2-3 times during a session to make sure I'm exercising in my zone. The other days, I walk on the treadmill for a set amount of time. The key for me is that exercising is always done in the morning and I monitor my progress, but I don't try to set specific targets. <br><br>For me, it's often enough to simply track what I'm doing (such as my weight or exercise) and that provides my brain with enough information to help me calibrate how much more or less I want to continue doing. I don't have to work so hard to figure out everything to the last detail; I like having a little looseness and messiness in the plan to allow for opportunity and improvisation.<br><br>If I were to set myself a goal of losing one pound a week or reading 20 pages a day and didn't hit that goal, I've then given my inner gremlin yet another club to hit me over the head with. So I'm careful about setting quotas for myself in that regard.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 July 2013 at 17:26 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Hi Mike - I think you have a good point about process vs. result.  I settled on kind of a mix of that.  I use process to set goals and track some things (exercise, piano, and reflection/meditation), to exactly avoid that beating myself up if I don't do as well as I hoped.  But for another category (reading, programming), I still like to set result goals to push me further.<br><br>I think the difference is this - if I'm behind in reading or programming, and I have a block of time, I'll feel motivated to catch up.  I might read more on the subway, or program instead of surfing the web.  But if I miss a workout or a day of practicing, having twice as long a workout isn't going to help.  So I track the process stuff like a habit, and reading/programming for results.<br><br>The other trick is only setting goals a week out for reading/programming.  So I still have a sense of a longer-term goal, but if I fall behind, there's really no domino effect - I just recalibrate for the next week.<br><br>And since I'm a geek (aren't we all), I keep track of it all in "points" - like one point for each day I exercise, practice, or meditate/reflect for 30 min, one point for hitting a reading goal (break up the weekly goals into 5-7 chunks), one point for each programming goal.  Then I have an overall week total that I can shoot to maximize.  I know it's a bit of a waste, but it makes things a little more fun.  And having that total, in theory, is a way to attach a carrot.  If you want to buy something, eat something ridiculous, play a game, or anything else moderately unproductive - set a point goal before you'll let yourself go :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 July 2013 at 17:46 | Katie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I often set goals with an escape clause. If I've exercised two days in a row, I can take the day off. I can't take two days in a row off without good reason. That way, if want to skip today, I'm encouraged to look ahead. Maybe tomorrow would be the better day to take off.<br><br>As for points, I hear you! Except my system got too complicated before it started, with lists of how many points for doing dishes on time vs late, and does a quick run round the house putting things away count the same as cleaning the bathrooms? (Done daily, the quick run takes five minutes and works miracles, so it should be encouraged, but it's only five minutes.)<br><br>I rewarded the kids when they reached the points total, not by time. That way, if they're running a bit late, they just have to keep working and they'll get their reward. Another way is partial points. At a dime a point, some weeks they wouldn't get as much. (Turns out, though, that neither big rewards nor money works with my kids. They're unbribable. It doesn't help that the grandparents give them money for most holidays.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 July 2013 at 22:18 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Points worked for me in housework as a good reason to  "stop"  -- i keep on going</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 July 2013 at 23:00 | Qeran</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>For professionals and entrepreneurs, Skedly is an ideal app for you!

In most systems I try (some more than others), I tend to take a project in the system, and plan it out into several sub-tasks, which I then re-enter into the system.  But then those sub-tasks often get the same treatment, breeding into a multitude of sub-sub tasks littering the system.  Rinse and repeat.  What eventually happens, is I spend waaaay too much of my day recursively planning, and waaaay too little of my day actually doing what I planned.  As a result, my system will eventually becomes totally bogged down with an army of minutia, conductiing a sit-in protest on my list(s).  Some systems resisted this better than others (DWM 2 held out the longest. GTD - which encourages planning as an integral part of the system, was always in some degree of failure).<br><br>I've tried all of Mark's systems, and they all fell prey to this over-planning problem eventually, except for DIT - so far.  This is my first foray into DIT, and it seems promising.  The way it is written, it allows for planning, but has very strong checks preventing the over-stuffing of your system.  The absolute key to making it work (and it's been stressed over and over in these forums, by Mark and others) is properly conducting the Audit when your DIT system fills up too much.  I have only conducted one audit so far, and I've found it both frustrating and cathartic.  Frustrating because I had to own up to my over planning and oust several of my well-intentioned plans, paring down my commintments to better fit the number of hours in my day.  Cathartic because proceeding from there, I felt much more assured of my ability to meet the remaining commitments - because I knew they were more realistic, and therefore, achieveable.  I can see how long term use of DIT would engender in me the habit of properly estimating the scope of my commitments, and my ability to achieve them.  With such a habit, I would not over-commit quite so much, and more regularly meet the realistic commitments I make for myself.<br><br>As for needing a goal to work toward to motivate myself, I need that too.  With DIT, I'm finding the simple goal of "get through today's list" works wonders - today's list being a list of outcomes I expect myself to achieve before the end of the day (eg: "1 chapter of 'Storm of Swords' read", or "List of candidate Property Management Companies written", or "All dirty dishes cleaned").  In other words, each day is a list of things I expect to accomplish in that day, and the goal I work toward is finishing the list that day.  As for "project" type goals, I keep a project list seperate from DIT (I label each project according to DIT's terms of continuous and organizational) and use that list to decide what I will aim for tomorrow.  For example:  I have "Condo rented out" on this project list, and on my DIT list for tomorrow I have the aforementioned "List of candidate Property Management Companies written".  That's all the more planning I will do for that goal.  Tomorrow, I will work hard to meet all my commitments, including drawing up that list.  I will do the research necessary to compile the list, and write it.  And when I cross it off, I will decide what I want to do the next day, perhaps "Quote from Company X obtained."  In this way, I never plan much more than one day in advance, and because I put it on a list with every other commitment I make for tomorrow, I can tell easily whether or not I'm overloading myself.<br><br>Of all the systems I've tried, DIT seems to produce for me, the right amout of planning to keep me motivated, moving, and flexible, yet puts me in check if I slip up and plan too much.  I hope DIT will help me finally ratchet down my over-planning habit to more of a right-planning habit.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 October 2013 at 15:41 | Miracle</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
