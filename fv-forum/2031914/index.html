Thank you for sharing.  Let me see if I have this right: Did you re-categorize everything daily, or simply change the order of the categories?  I understand how you renumbered them, but I'm not sure whether the number associated with each category changes accordingly, or whether you're essentially pushing things into new categories.  The latter seems to make sense for the first few categories, but then how would "new stuff" become "recurring daily"?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 December 2012 at 21:57 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Austin:<br><br>If you put something which recurs less than once per day on p. 6 then the following day it is renumbered to p. 5 where it is joined by new stuff coming in that day. The following day it is renumbered to p. 4 where it is joined by daily recurring stuff.<br><br>I say "day" but with some versions it would have happened faster than that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 December 2012 at 22:06 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Ah, I see.  So it's a conveyor belt toward expiration (like DWM) but with 6 or 7 different kinds of incoming tasks added at different points on the conveyor belt.

But however many variations I tried it always ended up being overloaded.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 December 2012 at 23:02 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I don't suppose you recall what category or categories of incoming work were primarily overloading the system?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>28 December 2012 at 20:19 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Austin:<br><br>The basic problem is that the pages you want to be quick-moving (urgent, incomplete, more than once a day) end up with too many tasks from the slower pages. So they stop being quick-moving. I couldn't find any way of stopping this happening.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>28 December 2012 at 21:23 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark,<br><br>Thank you again for sharing this with us. Ever since this thread, I have been brainstorming possible ways to make something like this work. One thing that occurred to me early is that you have too many pages, and therefore too many new items before they start getting weeded out. But decreasing the pages, by itself, is not enough. So I've kept thinking.<br><br>An idea has come to mind lately that might be heresy, but let me bounce it off you.  Suppose we put "new stuff" on page two.  This would mean that incoming new stuff gets filtered out rapidly unless you "touch" it.  If something new comes in, you have to do *something* on it tomorrow (even just brainstorming) in order to toss it into play, or it gets eliminated.  The best part is, you can always put it back in later if you *really* want or need to, because the system will handle new stuff quickly and keep them from piling up over days.<br><br>I'm thinking something like this:<br><br>1. Urgent<br>2. New stuff<br>3. Incomplete<br>4. Recurring<br><br>What are your thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 March 2014 at 20:32 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>It occurs to me that Vegheadjones' system (described at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2302540">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2302540</a> ) handles the problem that Mark describes (non-urgent things clogging up the urgent list), by making the creation of a Hotlist a conscious process, not an automatic one.   <br><br>Vegheadjones' system seems like a workbench adjacent to a conveyor belt.  The workbench is the hotlist, and the conveyor belt is the action book.   The conveyor belt is taking things AWAY from the work table.    New stuff goes onto the conveyor belt, at the end closer to the workbench.  The daily work focuses on the work table, but you can also reach over and grab anything close by from the conveyor belt.    Once a week, you look over the whole conveyor belt and see if anything should be moved to the workbench, or thrown away, or redefined.<br><br>Here is a picture:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/25td1mkd5a05q7m/hotlist%20conveyor%20belt.png">http://www.dropbox.com/s/25td1mkd5a05q7m/hotlist%20conveyor%20belt.png</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 March 2014 at 21:26 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>But there's no dismissal or deletion (other than voluntary), no separate points of incoming work, and it lacks the simplicity and algorithmic nature of Mark's systems, so it's not really comparable to this one.  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it - It looks workable and it clearly works for him.  But it isn't really comparable to this one, I don't think.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 March 2014 at 23:28 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Austin,<br>I like your thinking.  <br>I've been letting your recent idea 'cook' in my head:<br>1. Urgent<br>2. New stuff<br>3. Incomplete<br>4. Recurring<br>I think there could be something of worth here.  Of course, how would this work in a conveyor belt type way?  We can't really re-number the previous day's page as that would completely change the catagory and associated items (IE: we don't want "reocurring" to become "Incomplete"...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2014 at 3:15 | Mark Thomas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark Thomas,<br><br>It works the same way as in the system(s) Mark Forster described above. The categories don't label all the tasks on the page - they only label what sort of tasks get put into the page on a given day. So on your first day of working the system, you might do a recurring task and re-write it on page 4. The next day it will be on page 3, where it will be joined by incoming Incomplete tasks. The recurring task doesn't "become" incomplete; it just sits on the page where incomplete tasks are now being entered. If you do it that day, you re-write it on the new page 4. If you don't, then the next day it's on page 2, where it is joined by incoming "New Stuff." Make sense?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2014 at 15:13 | Austin</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
