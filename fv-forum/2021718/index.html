I want to finish projects to get real results, but at the same time, I often feel like if I touch a project once today, I can ignore it until tomorrow.  Since I don't want that, I'd like to know if there's any way you like to use FV to get yourself to finish something in a more timely matter.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 November 2012 at 21:24 | Hail2U!</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Each day I set myself three accomplishments.

It has been working quite well for me. FV keeps me on top of all of my commitments.

If you do not see three very important things that you want to accomplish for today already on the list, you add the ones you need to the bottom, as the FV rules state.<br><br>If you want, you can put some kind of mark before or after the three special tasks, e.g. an exclamation mark at the end of the task description.

Did you manage to get to the Big Three? As I understand it you're basically "highlighting" three current FV tasks as the Big Three, and just relying on standard FV rules to get those three tasks selected and actioned during the day. <br><br>Anyway, I was prompted to look at FV &amp; 3T after reading this "6 Simple Rituals" <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3003586/6-simple-rituals-reach-your-potential-every-day">http://www.fastcompany.com/3003586/6-simple-rituals-reach-your-potential-every-day</a> .

That includes weekends. I only use FV when I am at work, which does not include weekends.<br><br>It just is not an issue for me whether I have to leave my FV system to do my top 3. Sometimes, I get the top 3 done in the course of doing my FV list normally. Other times, I leave the list to do them.<br><br>I view the top 3 like an appointment on my calendar. They are not discretionary. I don't have to wait until they come up on the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>11 December 2012 at 18:36 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Interesting, I was just about to post how I use a very similar system to organize my tasks but it sound exactly how Sabre and Moises are describing.<br><br>I actually have two lists.<br><br>List 1 are my MIT's<br>List 2 is my Autofocus list.<br><br>List 1 always has exactly 12 tasks and are organized as:<br>-3mit's for the mid year (June 30th)<br>-3 mit's for this month (last day of the month)<br>-3 mit's for this week (last day is Sunday)<br>-3 mit's for today. (by midnight)<br><br>List 2 has all other things and is treated in af fashion.<br><br>I MUST complete items as required on list 1 and once those are under control,  I could work on List 2 just enough so the items on it do not grow in priority or unnecessarily get stale.  I do not end the day under no circumstances unless my days 3mits are complete, so I get them done asap.<br><br>Each month I create 3 mit's that will get me closer to achieving my mid year mits.<br>Each week I create 3 mit's that will get me closer to achieving my months mits.<br>Each day I create 3 mit's that will get me closer to achieving my weeks mits.<br><br>I got this idea from an iphone app called "Most Important Tasks" by MySoft Productivity. <br><br>The balance between list 1 and 2 keeps me focused on the important things and aware of things that need to get done later.  I find it very helpful to focus on creating achievable mit's routinely and obeying the self given deadlines. I also find it relaxing to routinely (morning time) skim my autofocus list to keep stress at a minimum.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>12 December 2012 at 5:53 | GMBW</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Next time I need to shake-up my system, I'm going to try that.
