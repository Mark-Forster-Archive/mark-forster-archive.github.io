I think its very well suited but some initial setup is necessary. In your 'to do ' view, sort tasks by starred and then by modified date, the latter in ascending order. This brings starred or preselected tasks to the top  and they are worked on in order. After you have worked on them, remove the star if the task its not complete and it drops to the bottom. <br>One drawback with MLO is that syncing across platforms is not automatic but they are working on an auto sync option, from what I know.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 11:06 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>If you have an Android phone, I recommend using FV with Any.Do. It's free and comes with various homescreen widgets.<br><br>It has a beautiful interface, to my mind nicer than Wunderlist. It syncs with Google tasks. And it has a few special but unobstrusive features. For instance, you can drag-and-drop from the main screen to rearrange tasks (which I greatly prefer to entering a separate screen). You can use voice recognition to dictate your notes instead of type them. If you start to type the name of a contact, it will suggest "Call contact X" and if you select it you will see an icon to make the call directly from the list when you're ready. <br><br>One oddity is that new tasks are inserted at the top of the list, not bottom. This means you must preselect (by marking high priority) from the bottom up. It also means that your preselected list is automatically ordered correctly (first task on top) when you are done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 12:55 | FSE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I've found Clear (iphone) to be great for FV.

However, I also want to have a tickler list (due date) in the same app and then when something comes due to drag it over to the FV.   However, you can't filter a particular list and/or sort priority.   <br><br>I guess in any.do one could use "priority" which puts a red mark on the edge without sorting by priority (rather sort "by folder").   However, Wunderlist does both filtering (via various lists) and sorting (by star) as well syncs easily between all of my devices.  Any.do is not on ios  nor does it have a web client (though they have been promising this for months now).  And its sync with google tasks has been problematic for me in the past.  <br><br>So, for now, Wunderlist it is for me.  Though if any.do changed the ability to filter and sort as well as come up with a web client and ios app I would be all over it.

I've not found any bugs using it with my iPad, iPhone or on the Web so I am surprised you say that? Perhaps I'm missing something.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 22:25 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I have noticed a few bugs in Wunderlist that are frustrating. The iPhone app seems to be much worse than the iPad app. The main problem I'm seeing is when I "unstar" an action it usually drops to the bottom. Then if I close the app and reopen it later, the tasks have floated back up to the top (underneath any tasks that remain starred). This doesn't always happen, but when it does it really messes up the FV system. The app works great if you rarely "unstar" something, but I'd say about half of the tasks I do each day are either for a recurring task or a project that will be worked on over several days. So I unstar a lot of items. I also mentioned earlier that some tasks would stay at the top of the list even after I unstarred them. Lastly, I've noticed a considerable lag in response time (just the iPhone version). I might press the star 3 or 4 times before it responds. Before switching to FV I had only dabbled with Wunderlist. After using it exclusively for 2 days, I have found enough bugs to switch back to TaskPaper.<br><br>TaskPaper has a really good app for the iPhone and iPad. It's name conveys a lot. It attempts to be very similar to a simple sheet of paper. But this is magic paper with an endless number of lines and the ability to move lines of text around with a simple drag &amp; drop method. You can watch a demo of the iPhone app here: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://taskpaper.s3.amazonaws.com/iphone.mov">http://taskpaper.s3.amazonaws.com/iphone.mov</a><br><br>It syncs through dropbox, so you don't want to go back and forth between the iPhone and the iPad until enough time has elapsed for the sync to take effect (and this is especially true if you are not on a good wifi connection). But most of us aren't trying to work from the iPad and iPhone on the same app at the same time. So this is rarely a problem.<br><br>Here's my workflow for TaskPaper:<br>1) Highlight an item<br>2) Tag with an "@" symbol<br>3) Filter so only tagged tasks are shown<br>4) Manually reverse the order of the tagged tasks<br>5) Unfilter the tasks (all tagged tasks will now be at the top of your list)<br>6) If task is completed I strike through. If it is recurring or incomplete I untag and manually move the task to the bottom of the list.<br><br>It takes a few additional steps to establish your preselection list because you have to tag the items instead of simply tapping the star. The real bummer is having to manually move recurring or incomplete tasks back to the bottom. But, Wunderlist wasn't always successful in doing this anyways! For me, it is worth the peace of mind knowing that all my tasks will stay in the order I placed them. In reality, I'm losing very little time in my day.<br><br>Are there any other TaskPaper users out there who work the FV system differently?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 3:56 | Brad</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Frank &lt;So far, it seems to work just fine for me using ToodleDo&gt;<br><br>Thanks for this,  I copied your post into Evernote and read it again last night. <br><br>The tip off about the Android beta: I've been using Ultimate-To-Do-List to sync and will keep it until the Android Toodledo is out of beta.<br><br>This weekend I want to transfer from pen and paper.I may post later on how I've tweaked it with Toodledo.

If I want to work on a specific project only, I just select it and add one of the following searches:<br><br>- t (task):  and %snippet:activeTask%<br>- f (focus):  and %snippet:focusTask%<br><br>Up to now I am happy with this solution, for project related work is done with another application, which does complement TaskPaper in a very good way.<br><br>HTH, and let me know your feelings about it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 9:56 | Stefano F.

I am in contact with Jesse (the programmer) and Grey (technical support) to get things aligned accordingly.<br><br>Regarding the display of projects: it doesn't matter at what level your projects are located. They will show up as long as there are children "tasks" to be displayed according to the filtering. As soon as the project is empty, it will not show up - this is made sure with: not type = "project" or if you like you could reformulate it as: type matches "note|task".

Rausch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@Stephano,<br>I am currently using Workflowy for FV and I just realized from your discussions with Brad that Taskpaper is standalone application with similar concepts. And, I really love the way Workflowy works but it is a web app. So, I am deciding to switch over to Taskpaper. After reading through your comments, the combination of TextExpander and Taskpaper seems like the ideal combination for me. I am just moving my tasks to Taskpaper and I was curious about your setup - which probably will be answered in your upcoming PPT. <br><br>* From your snippets, I see you have Projects called Inbox, Archive, Scheduled. Can you help me understand how your setup looks like. <br><br>* The one problem I have had with Workflowy was my ability to deal with dated/due items in a simple manner. The most interesting thing I noticed was your use of the tag @day. Can you please elaborate on it?<br><br>* I have a windows pc as well, so I worry about the level of compatibility with Todopaper? Any experiences or things I should watch out for?<br><br>* I am trying to reuse your TE snippets for my setup as well. However, I am unfamiliar with TextExpander as well as Taskpaper. So, any help in setting up the snippets would be helpful as well. <br><br>Thanks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>18 March 2012 at 2:18 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>FV would make a really neat HTML5 application for off-line use inside a browser. From what I've seen of Google Chrome's infrastructure, it could be packaged nicely as a downloadable app, available at the Chrome store.<br><br>All data could be stored on the client using the new "storage" support of HTML5. There would be two views: (1) all items shown from oldest to newest (for making the preselection), (2) just the preselected items shown from newest to oldest. A nifty animated transition could be engaged via CSS3, that ends up hiding the unselected items by setting "display: none" or collapsing them to "height: 0" while the preselected items swap head-to-tail. Each item could have a title and a note field. Clicking an item could mark it "selected" (for view 1) or "done" (for view 2). A "Save As" feature could generate an XML file for backup, in case the browser's Storage section were to get wiped.<br><br>If only I were looking to procrastinate, I might whip something up as I am learning HTML5. However, thanks to FV, I am using  *real* project that actually matters to me as a way of learning HTML5, and since I'm not looking for an electronic FV solution, I'm going to pass.<br><br>But if someone else wants to learn HTML5 and wants a digital FV, why not give it a try?<br><br>BTW, it doesn't have to be offline. XML output could be mirrored via Dropbox or uploaded to a URL of the user's choice.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>18 March 2012 at 2:42 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Hi Greenchutney,<br><br>Yes, you are right. Workflowy has a astonishing resemblance with TaskPaper, even though the latter does not support "node folding" for the time being.<br><br>As you have realised, the one drawback of Workflowy is the fact that it is a web application only. TaskPaper on the other hand is available on all 3 major Apple platforms, i.e. the Mac, the iPad and the iPhone - no need for a web version.<br><br>-- My set up is simple. Have look …<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inbox:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduled:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archive:<br><br>The Inbox and the Archive projects are self-explanatory. Take notice though that I do use the Inbox only, if I have a burst of ideas and I do not want to think too long where to put them, because I am on the run. Normally I do have enough time to put new tasks into the correct AoR it belongs to - see below.<br><br>Business, Family and Personal are my Areas of Responsibility ( AoR ). These "projects" can never be completed, i.e. are ongoing. I very seldom do add a sub-project and if, only temporarily. I do not like too complex ( sub- ) project structures.<br><br>Scheduled does contain all recurring items that I do not want to put into a calendar, to avoid cluttering it. I like to immediately see which AoR they do belong to and hence I have added the respective sub-projects. I do use the calendar mostly for meetings and other appointments, so that they do stand out while looking at it.<br><br>-- The nice thing about TextExpander is the fact that ( 1 ) it is available on the Mac, the iPad and the iPhone ( 2 ) it can not only do the same stuff as Apple's shortcuts text replacement-wise, but also do some magic with dates, time and the respective maths - have a look at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/faq.html">http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/faq.html</a> and search for the "How can enter today's date with a TextExpander snippet?" question and especially at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.smilesoftware.com/2008/10/28/textexpander-date-and-time-math/.">http://blog.smilesoftware.com/2008/10/28/textexpander-date-and-time-math/.</a><br><br>Hence I do use the @day tag ( for scheduling ) as follows: @day(YYYY-MM-DD). Reason being: TaskPaper does compare tag values alphabetically. Therefore, a value of e.g. 2012-01-01 is lesser than 2012-02-01.<br><br>-- Wooba is right, about the 100% compatibility of TodoPaper with TaskPaper - regarding the file structure only!!! TodoPaper 1.x is, AFAIK, not capable of the powerful search queries TaskPaper can handle. However, and as stated above in my previous post, Jordan Sherer is "currently" working on a Version 2.0, which will be much more in line with TP - no ETA is available though. The best way forward and to be on the safe side would be to directly contact Jordan and to ask him exactly what is possible with TodoPaper 1.x and what will be possible with 2.x ( once released ) query-wise.<br><br>-- The snippets have to be set up in TextExpander Mac / Touch. TaskPaper is out of the game here. Just launch / open the respective application and on:<br><br>- TET: tap on the Groups tab, create a new group and key in a pair of shortcut and "content", i.e. the search for TP<br><br>- TEM: create a new group and enter the "content" - abbreviation pair too.<br><br>No rocket science is involved.<br><br>HTH and let me know, if you need some additional support.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>18 March 2012 at 3:40 | Stefano F.

It is brilliant. I mimicked most of your setup, with my own twists and I have a working solution. But most importantly, I worked the FV list today and it has worked very well. I must say TP+TE combo is a killer app. I still have to see how it works with due dates stuff and I may need more snippets to make it seemless. For example, I need to find a way to just search and select items that may be due in the next couple of days, so I can convert them to tasks (from notes). I was curious as to how you manage that.<br><br>Also, there were no notes in Todopaper on my PC. That was a deal breaker for me using it on my laptop, given your setup.

However, sometimes I have to. Trying to minimise the usage I came up with the following:<br><br>- scheduled [ and due] and repeating if in project Scheduled @day(2012-02-29) [ day | month-day | year-month-day ] every [ x ] day(s) | [ x ] week(s) | [ x ] month(s) | [ x ] year(s)<br><br>Here are some full expanded examples:<br><br>- pay house rent @day(2012-04-12) 15 every month<br>- cover Multichoice debit order @day(2012-04-28) 05-01 every 2 months<br>- pay P.O. Box renewal @day(2012-12-01) 2013-01-01 every year<br><br>just to give you an idea. The advantage of this method is that I have only 1 date / time related tag. Setting the schedule some days in advance and having the visual clue when exactly the task is due gives me some days of buffer to tackle it, without any pressure.<br><br>To make a long story short: I do use 5 tags only and very sparingly, i.e.<br><br>- @day(YYYY-MM-DD) for scheduling<br>- @done(YYYY-MM-DD) for items i want to keep in the current active project as a reminder or if I want to archive the task<br><br>and the following I am trying to avoid at all costs, if possible:<br><br>- @someday if I really want to see the task in my weekly reviews only<br>- @today for marking very IMPORTANT / URGENT task I HAVE to knock off during the day<br>- @week for marking items that I want to do during the week<br><br>To be honest, since I started using FiVe ( The Final Version ;) I am actively only using the @day and @done tag. The system does cover the @someday, @today and @week tag in an amazing way that tagging is not needed. However, it is good to know that I have ways to visually handle "extreme" cases, should I really have / need to.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 March 2012 at 0:14 | Stefano F.

Thank you for the report!<br><br>Also, I agree with you regarding the use of tags (they can easily be overused). I actually began the system without any tags at all. If I weren't a student I probably wouldn't worry about it. But I found that when I was studying, I spent less time selecting what I wanted to do next, if I could see the due date. (Plus, it feels really good to start working on a major assignment that isn't due for another two months. I've never been THAT student! ;)<br><br>My work requires a lot of scheduled appointments. I use the calendar for keeping track of those, but I have also keep a task "Meet w/ Client A" tagged with the date of the last meeting. For example, Meet with Client A @last(2012-03-19). This allows me to see if my client is due for a follow up. The list of clients is long enough that I keep a separate project with their names listed. Then, in the Inbox, I have a generic task "Schedule Client Meeting" which means I need to select whichever client is due for a meeting.<br><br>So the only tags I'm actively using are @due, @last, and @done.<br><br>I wouldn't want to see a bunch of @work, @home, @school, @car, @phone, etc. tags. That would be too cluttered for me. But contexts are one of the key tenets of GTD, so I'm sure a lot of people like working that way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 March 2012 at 2:51 | Brad</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>You are welcome Brad :)<br><br>As many others I started using tags all over, being fascinated with the possibilities of filtering and manipulating entries.

Now,  from my point of view, I am wiser :D<br><br>Realising what powerful search engine / query language TaskPaper does have I am happy to have settled with "contexts". I still use them, but more prose-wise - even though I nevertheless can filter by the keywords.

Very nice first shot, and most of the way there right out of the gate.<br><br>I like the long entry line, hitting enter to add an item and then add another if desired, the nice big dot, the greying out of undotted ones, the ability to cancel a dot by clicking again, the focused list once done, the ability to add an item while in focused list view, and the re-add button. All are completely in line with the FV rules. <br><br>First, before I say anything else, and at risk of crossing this line myself, I would caution not adding any features in the future that are not specifically addressing Mark's rules as currently stated. As Alan wisely said, "You can’t randomly tweak a Forster system, because most changes make it worse."<br><br>I'm agreeing with the comments from Stefano above, and mostly about the ability to change an item after entering. I have encountered two instances where this was undesirable. First was wanting to add a job number to an existing task to make it clearer. I couldn't go back and add it. <br><br>Second was hitting the re-add button. It was for a task that was repeating, but had a different due date. I wanted to have it be copied to the last spot on the list, but to change the date first. I find that when I cross out and rewrite, about half the time I rewrite something slightly different because it's clearer. It would be nice and in line with FV to have that option when you hit re-add: keep it the same, or change it. <br><br>This is an excellent digital execution of FV. It doesn't make it more complicated, which most digital solutions tend to do. The temptation is great to add other features, tweaks etc, but I think you are dead-on by keeping it simple and not trying to "improve" on FV. <br><br>Nice work!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>19 March 2012 at 20:36 | scottmoehring</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@scottmoehring Thanks for your kind words, really pleased that trying to keep it pure was something that got noticed!<br><br>We're looking into editing, and are putting together a list of features to work through.

On top of that I did keep project-related files / documents in Dropbox reflecting the project structure for "easy" finding … not really.<br><br>The next step in trying to develop a better PM support was to reduce the sub-project structure in TP and to use more tags instead, while on the file side to use only one folder for all and tagging the documents with Tags for Mac. Things were getting better, but not much. My project.taskpaper files were littered with tags that I nearly couldn't recognise the original tasks anymore - too much noise. On the other hand, the approach with Tags for the hard stuff was relieving and promising - no headaches anymore about where exactly to put a file, but nevertheless easy and fast to find at least on the Mac; no chances on the iPhone / iPad. This was inspired by the post "File System Infobase Manager" of Doug on <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://dougist.com.">http://dougist.com.</a><br><br>Most probably you will already smile, having realised that the big issue had still to be resolved. How on earth can he work with that setup on an iPhone / iPad? It is possible, but very cumbersome …<br><br>My current setup for PM is again simple, but effective - the 3rd step in the evolution. Nothing new to you, I am sure of that, and it has been discussed on these forums in the past too:<br><br>- In TaskPaper Mac / Touch I have only a short entry: work for &lt;Project&gt; [ : perhaps with an additional comment / note what the next step is, just to tune me in ] [ @day(YYYY-MM-DD) if I have to meet a deadline ] - see my previous post in this thread on March 19, 2012 at 8:29.<br><br>- Everything else is handled from within Evernote Mac / Touch! The project-related tasks, notes, documents, files etc. The positive side is that I can work on a project whenever and wherever I want to, even if I am not connected to the Internet - being a premium member, I have all the required ( offline ) notebooks on my iPhone as well as on my iPad. Peace of mind :)<br><br>To make a long story short: from TaskPaper Mac / Touch to Evernote Mac / Touch and back. You only need 2 applications and have all the data you need at hand. Currently pure Nirwana for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 March 2012 at 20:21 | Stefano F.

I think the BlancList is great, but I've become already dependent on using the @context tags in TaskPaper to filter out tasks I can't do. I keep one big list with everything, because I often work from home, and do personal tasks at the office, but don't want to see "cut grass" when I'm at the office, or "process office in-tray" at home. I've also decided I don't like the method of moving unactionable tasks to the bottom of the list - knowing myself, I will game the system to avoid doing those things that have bubbled up to the top. TaskPaper lets me hide the tasks I legitimately cannot do, without having them lose the pressure of being at the top when I get back to the place where I can do them.<br><br>So for me, TaskPaper is perfect, except for the awesome little "re-add" button in BlancList.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 March 2012 at 16:49 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@ Christopher: If you are using TP Mac, a possible alleviation might be the following AppleScript:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/wiki/TogglePreselectedTasksAndMoveToEndOfProject">http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/wiki/TogglePreselectedTasksAndMoveToEndOfProject</a><br><br>Enjoy the Final Version on TaskPaper :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 March 2012 at 17:35 | Stefano F.

It will synchonize across all your apps. If you've failed to back up your computer and it dies on you, it doesn't matter because you can recover it all from the Evernote website. <br><br>You can tag tasks, search them, hyperlink to other tasks or notes, include notes in the task, and put documents and the like straight into the system. If you're writing a book or article you can write it directly into your task without it disrupting the list. By using tags, you can work on a subset of your complete list. <br><br>It's streets beyond any program that only works on a straight list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 March 2012 at 3:50 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@ Brett : Great!

Evernote ( EN ) is a ( nearly ) perfect working environment for … projects. And that's the reason why it is my first choice in that respect.<br><br>However, as some others have already pointed out, EN Desktop and EN Mobile do differ in a few aspects, amongst others:<br><br>-- different way of handling the view of tags : doesn't reflect the desktop structure on the mobile side, just one long list to scroll through.<br><br>-- to the mobile environment adapted handling of notes, which is more than acceptable, if you are on the run and complements the working with the desktop version.<br><br>What I'm seeking is a magical balance between a simple, but powerful way of tackling non-project related tasks and your Final Version Time Management System. By the way, I am applying FV within EN for projects ;)<br><br>The ( system ) setup should reflect the beauty of paper and pen as well as the power of electronic data manipulation, if the need arises. Furthermore, to pick up the hat analogy, I do like to work focused in a "simple task" mode and in a "complex project" mode. Both ways are fun - and that is important, but do have different ways of being handled efficiently and effectively. At least that is my understanding:<br><br>-- simple task mode : most of the cases one doesn't have to keep in mind complex relationships between different tasks or conditions to be applied. The job is usually straight forward. - Here EN does not excel. *astrongandcontroversialstatementupfordiscussion*<br><br>-- complex project mode : the starting point is literally the opposite to the "simple task mode". Relationships between, dependencies of other and preconditions for tasks - just to name a few variables to take notice of - do mandate a different setup, to be in the position to fully grasp the big picture as well as to handle the tiniest detail. - Here EN excels!<br><br>I think that in my opinion I currently have found the best choice for myself for the "simple task" mode with TaskPaper. However, I don't want to argue that there are possibly very good alternatives to it. Of the top of my head Notational Velocity does spring into my mind … it really boils down to one's each personal preferences and the own working style.<br><br>Conclusion: Every approach is good as long as one does believe in it and feels comfortable with it. No doubts about that!<br><br>P.S.: It's nice to exchange views :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 March 2012 at 9:41 | Stefano F. Rausch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I find Handbase by ddhsoftware perfect for FV. It costs money but there is a desktop, iphone and Android version, and lists synchronise at item level.<br><br>There's a wee bit of setup "overhead" but you can have a checkbox to mark selected tasks and set up a separate view that filters out non-selected tasks so you can focus on those, and which sorts them into reverse order at the same time; and you can set it up so they disappear from that view as you complete them, but not from the main view.<br><br>It is also helpful for the little and often approach as you can easily copy a task and have it automatically reappear at the end of the list, then check off the original.<br><br>If I am starting to sound like a rep for the company, I will say it is not without its bugs( I lost a file yesterday but that was my shopping list!), and synchronisation is not always seamless, but it is easily the best I have tried for FV, as well as other things.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 March 2012 at 16:13 | IanS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Bob Pankratz did have the following comments regarding my setup / a script of mine for the use of FV with TaskPaper:<br><br>" Nice work on the documentation and those scripts for the Final Version -<br><br>I like the idea of notes for none preselected tasks. I usually need to leave the checked off version in the list until I archive even if it's a repeating task or a partially completed task. So I took your idea and extended it. Here is a CompleteAndRepeat script. It will check off the any selects items of type task as done, date when you did that, remove a @Today tag if it's present; and then renter it at the bottom of the list as note.  Those people that want to use ALL Tasks and Preselect with CMD-Y and the @today tag, can also use the script just comment out the "Set entry type to note type" line.
