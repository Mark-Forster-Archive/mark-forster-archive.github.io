So my FV list is available on my Toshiba notebook (Windows 7), Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone (Android) and now on my new iPad (iOS), all synchronised via the Evernote web site.<br><br>In the absence of MS Project-type projects, I put a checklist of sub-tasks in the body of the Evernote task, the title being the task.  Mostly I can just put the task title with the FV Chain tag, however sometimes I may copy the sub-task as a new task title on its own with the FV Chain tag to bring it more sharply into focus, eg if it's a task on which all subsequent sub-tasks depends.<br><br>I also keep daily/weekly/monthly task lists in a Routines notebook.

When I have sequence of tasks, I write down only first task  - I create new task immediately after finishing preceding task.  Or - alternatively - I just write down the whole subproject "work on X" and do some work on it - without further written specification. It varies with complexity of project, your personality, your mood...<br><br>(2) I put my "project list" in other file, where I break tasks by subprojects, phases...or as needed. These are my "future" tasks, "maybe" tasks, "do not forget" and information. Actual project tasks, which are in FV, does not have to be copied here. So the project list is a "database" of possible tasks for me, just to be sure that I do not forget something. I do not follow any rule here - I only consult the file from time to time as I feel like it. You can actually have "review project list" task in FV, but I do not consider it important for me. When I feel I have lack of project tasks in FV, I look at project file - or I just create new tasks which seems important/urgent at the moment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 April 2012 at 16:04 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Here's what I do in Clear:<br><br>Main FV List looks something like this near the bottom:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://zackallen.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fvMain.jpg">http://zackallen.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fvMain.jpg</a><br><br>Notice there are some items called "xxxxx Workflow."

I use the FV methodology in Outlook (tasks).  I have a specific task/project that involves: "Complete Monhtly reporting (April)" (PS: I am head of Finance in a organisation).<br><br>There is quite a number of things I must do to complete this and what I do is to actually write all the items I must do in the Text box of the outlook task.  This serves then as a checklist for me to make sure I have for example: Reviewed receivables/Report pack to the US/Check inventory provisions/...etc.<br><br>So, if I want to do Reporting, then I go into this text box and complete some of these tasks by applying the FV principle.<br><br>But, I get what you are saying: I should rather rephrase the project by stating: Review Month End reporting.  I can then still have the tasks/sub project in this box, but it will serve as a checklist, rather than a working list.<br><br>By reviewing the checklist I can then decide which of the tasks/sub projects I can actually start and then enter them into the FV list.<br><br>Thus, if I can start with the Inventory provision, then I can add them to my FV list.<br><br>Do you agree?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 April 2012 at 7:23 | Nico</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Nico, I agree wholeheartedly.<br><br>It's easier to have checklists to hand in electronic versions, such as with Outlook, Evernote and the others mentioned by users on this forum.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 April 2012 at 10:03 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Nico:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I have a specific task/project that involves: "Complete Monhtly reporting (April)" (PS: I am head of Finance in a organisation). &gt;&gt;<br><br>I have nothing against writing check lists if you feel you need them, but you are adding overhead to the system. <br><br>If you are doing a regular monthly report then I would have expected that you would know what was required without needing a list to refer to. <br><br>So you could enter the tasks directly into FV from your head. If you realise you've forgotten something then just add it when you think of it. The "Review Monthly Report" task ensures that everything has been thought of. <br><br>Surely much easier than continually writing and referring to check lists that you don't really need?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 April 2012 at 14:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>If "Monthly Report" is a recurring item, and it has several distinct steps or components, it's easy to keep that in Outlook Tasks or OneNote or Evernote or any of those kinds of systems that have a title for the task name, and a "details" pane.   I do this kind of thing all the time.  The checklist would go into the details pane.   When I'm done with this month's report, I make a copy of the task and put it in my tickler for the next time it is due.   The checklist is still there in the details pane.   <br><br>It's easy in OneNote to "select all" and then clear all the checkmarks, so it's fresh and ready for next time.  <br><br>There's no rewriting or anything so it's very low overhead, I'd even say zero overhead since it works like any other task that has details attached to it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>23 April 2012 at 2:07 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark,<br><br>The problem is that there is to much to remember.  To close the organisations books and to report to the various stakeholders involves multiple steps, task and dependencies involving other people in the organisation.  I am almost certain that I will forget something or to check up on someone if I do not have checklist.  <br><br>Do note that this checklist has been developed over a period of time and I add to it constantly when I note something amiss in the closing procedure.  For example: last month the accounts payable clerk forgot to ask the suppliers for outstanding invoices.  This had a material impact on our results.  Now what I do is to add a question on my "Monthly reporting" checklist: Did AP clerk check with all suppliers?<br><br>Seraphim,<br><br>Do you work in details pane or do you copy tasks over to the main FV.  Mark convinced me to add new tasks to the main FV rather than working in the details pane.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>23 April 2012 at 6:05 | Nico</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Nico,<br><br>I think Mark is just saying to add those steps/tasks straight into FV. That makes perfect sense to me unless the steps are necessarily sequential. You can still add them to the list, but that adds a great deal of unnecessary clutter in tasks that will simply be scanned over and over and over before they become relevant.<br><br>I don't do well with clutter. That's why I have separate "checklists" or "workflows" that FV references. I don't necessarily have to do all of the tasks before moving on either. I just reenter the "workflow" task at the bottom of the list when I no longer feel like working on it.<br><br>I do a few of the "Sunday Morning Workflow" tasks on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, but on Sunday morning I don't want to see ANYTHING, but that list. It helps maintain my focus.<br><br>Again, not saying this should be the rule for everyone, just that this seems necessary for the way my brain works.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>23 April 2012 at 6:22 | Zack Allen</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Every project is different, so treat each one they way that works best for you.<br><br>Yea, that is vague.  Has to be. <br><br>I am not sure how you move, but it is pretty straight-forward to me.  I am only going to put the things in my list that I know I can accomplish with the information that I currently have.  So, when I begin to move, my list will only have things that I can really take care of right now with my current resources.<br><br>For example:<br><br>Do I need to pack?  Sure.  Do I have boxes to pack?  No.<br><br>- Get boxes<br><br>Leave packing off your list.  You can't pack right now anyways, but you can get boxes.  You are not going to forget to pack once you get the boxes, trust me.  Work through everything this way, and only add the things that you know that you can do.  This way, once you get to an item on the list, you can actually accomplish it.  <br><br>For moving, you might only start with 4-5 tasks at first.  Finish them, and add tasks as you work your way through items.  You are moving, so you know that your eventual goal is getting your stuff from one place to another - no need to put it all on the list.<br><br>I am using Evernote, so I might add a comment about where I am in the task in the comment section when I remove the "Do" tag.<br><br>Hope that helps.  Works for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>23 April 2012 at 6:30 | Chris Parker</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Nico wrote:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Do you work in details pane or do you copy tasks over to the main FV.
