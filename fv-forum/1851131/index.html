Yes.<br><br><br>"If so, why the mystery about which app you are talking about?"<br><br>... A few reasons:<br><br>1. People will download the older build of the app, experience the bugs, crashes, and me describing features which are only in an unreleased build they aren't using and thus can't use with the method I describe. Some will then promptly write complaints about it here and in the app store. It's not ready for general FV use yet, but is ready to be talked about a little and privately tested and perfected. The same as Mark describing the benefits of FV, noting his progress, having a working version, and yet testing and refining it privately until it was good enough for public release. I found an app with potential, wrote the developer, became a tester, have had many dialogues with the developer since, and have created and refined a method of use that could be ready for release (and my own full-time use) with just a few more essential additions to the app.<br><br>2. Some additional vital features are missing for general use. It took a lengthy, complicated workaround for me to import my tasks into the app. It required using a paid desktop app that allows import of tasks in a very roundabout way. I had to experiment to find a solution. Many will download the iPhone app and say, "It crashes, it's buggy, I can't import my tasks", and on and on.<br><br>3. While I don't believe that 99.9% of forum members are like this, some angry, entitled, impolite person may be lurking who will download the current build, use it without a solid method and complain that the app has ruined their lives, has no value, and with steam jetting from their ears, white-hot lava spitting from their open fissures, will demand a refund from the developer and an apology from me. So many on the app store express how destitute and emotionally broken they were left when they parted ways with their 99 cents or so and didn't like an app. I'm not about to encourage even one of those people to download it yet. <br><br>I was out with the flu for about a week and am feeling better, so I'll be back in regular communication with the forum and the developer now and can perhaps help things speed along.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 June 2012 at 22:19 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Thanks for the explanation, MB, and sorry you've been suffering with the flu. You've left a trail of hints here that make it sound like you're talking about IndexCard (iOS) &amp; Scrivener (Mac/Win), which appear to be great tools for collecting and organizing snippets of text and other info for creative writing; they don't appear well suited to checklists or to-do lists, at least in the online descriptions I found on the denvog and literatureandlatte sites.

It works especially well if you sort the list by Date Added in reverse order (oldest at the top) and use stars for dots. When a task is actioned but not finished, just clone it, which creates an exact copy with a new creation date. Then check off the older copy. If you keep your list in one main folder and use tags or contexts to filter it, you can reduce it as you see fit. And if you subscribe for a very reasonable $15 a year, you can have subtasks that can be seen inline or not as you choose, on both the iOS and web platforms. Finally, Toodledo lets you control what fields you see, so it doesn't look nearly as cluttered as (say) Appigo Todo.<br><br>Maybe this new one will do more than Toodledo, and I will try it when you release the name, but I'm skeptical.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>16 June 2012 at 1:22 | George G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Michael B.,<br><br>What's the status?

There is no holy grail. It's simply the best balance of minimalist form, function, and rare features that I've found in any one app, like: instant scroll to the bottom, sublists for projects, color highlighting, and the ability to use recurring checklists.<br><br>I tried FocusPad and though I want to love it, I would need to have a setting to use it as one long scrollable list, with instant scrolling to the bottom and sublists.

What we need is an independently-wealthy passionate forum member who desires a minimalist, tactile, beautiful non-paper mobile solution with plenty of white space, teamed up with a passionate designer with a minimalist design-philosophy and a skilled programmer, all of whom are willing to adjust their work based on input from the forum while knowing when to say no to extreme requests that would complicate the app's clean visual design. <br><br>I could design the perfect app if I had the enormous amount of money and time required to have it programmed. But most forum members could do that. The key missing elements are: money, time, and programming skills. And money.

But I must say I find the method pretty underwhelming - especially considering the anticipation you created. I'll be sticking to synced text files - and real paper - for my FV needs. Less "automated" perhaps but way less fiddly; anything that requires that lengthy an explanation is likely to get in the way of actually getting things done IMHO. <br>In a way I'm grateful that you've hammered one more nail in the coffin of my search for the software holy grail.
