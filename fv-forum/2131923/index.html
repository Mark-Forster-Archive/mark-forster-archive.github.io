Of course I have 'tweaked' it a bit and would like to share what really makes it work for me.<br><br>-one big list<br>-I put a line marker to divide the top 5 items from the rest of the list<br>-Starting from the BOTTOM of the list I look at the last item, then ask myself, "(this item) OR (next higher item)".   I keep doing this, working my way up the list.  This way I always am only selecting ONE item.  <br>-when I get to the dividing line (the top 5 items).  I pick one task from those 5.<br>-Then I do the single item I picked from the bottom, followed by doing the single item I picked from the top 5.<br>-A new dividing line is drawn to separate the now current top 5.  <br>-And repeat.<br><br>Basically it's derived from FV with a few exceptions.  <br>-The 'top 5' catagory gives you a choice of tasks which you've probably been putting off.  Makes it easier to finally get-on with something.<br>-Only selecting one item from the bottom list keeps things moving and keeps you familiar and "in" your list.  A benifit I've found to this is that I can pretty much dump anything (big or small) in and it ends up being filtered.<br>-Asking, "(lower task) OR (higher task)"  does take a bit of time, however I find it very effective at synthesizing priority/want/desire/urgency/etc...<br><br>I know we are all unique and this may not work at all for you.  But I wanted to share because I have found this approach extreemely helpful.<br><br>Blessings!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 May 2013 at 2:23 | Marco</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Marco:<br><br>I'm not clear in my mind how this works, particularly the selection of the "bottom task". Could I check with you that I've got it right?<br><br>Suppose there are 60 tasks in your list.  You partition off Tasks 1-5. Then you go to Task 60 and ask yourself "Task 60 OR Task 59?" <br><br>If the answer is "Task 60", you then ask yourself "Task 60 OR Task 58?" If the answer is "Task 60" again, then the question is "Task 60 or Task 57?" If the answer then is "Task 57", the next question is "Task 57 or Task 56?" <br><br>You continue this way until you have considered every task back to and including Task 6. That whole process produces one selection only.<br><br>Then you chose one task from the partitioned-off Tasks 1-5 to give you a second selection.<br><br>You then do the two tasks in reverse order, i.e. the one nearest the end of the list first.<br><br>Have I got this right?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 May 2013 at 20:42 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark.  Yes that is correct.  In practice, I find that I am rather quickly scanning the list asking the "or" question, so it really doesn't take too long.<br>I'm very excited about this as it has been keeping things moving very well.  I see things moving up into the "top 5" group and finally being actioned (even if it's just a small start).  Dismissials become obvious as I'll notice an item in the top group just staying there (being avoided).  I find myself either just doing something (anything) on it to make it go back to the bottom of the list; or dismissing the item as I've finally realized it doesn't need to be done.<br>Also, I can even put daily/urgent items on the bottom because you're never very far away from being able to do that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 May 2013 at 23:28 | Marco</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Also:  The reason I advocate asking "or" when selecting a task (as opposed to 'what do I want to do' or different question) is because of my belief that my brain knows how to judge the importance/priority/fun/desire/want/etc between tasks.  Asking 'or' is vague enough, yet allows my brain to make the necessary comparison.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 May 2013 at 23:33 | Marco</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>It sounds interesting.

However, I have not yet succeeded in finding a simple method that will work this way and still put adequate pressure on the top of the list. There also isn't a closed-list effect (nor is there a closed-list effect in my other one-task FV-like system), and I consider this a disadvantage. So I'm still thinking.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>25 March 2014 at 16:28 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Frank and Austin:<br><br>I'm not sure whether I have ever written about this before, but some time ago I did invent quite an effective method for using Colley's rule on a list.

When you've done that task, use the task after the one you've just done as your benchmark, and do the first task after that which you are resisting more. When you reach the end of the list, loop back to the beginning. Continue this way until the whole list is done.<br><br>If you manage to circle back to your current benchmark without finding a task that you are resisting more, then do the benchmark task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 March 2014 at 14:52 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Hi Mark,<br><br>I've actually recently thought of using that very method to process UTMS, only with the question, "What would I rather do right now than X?" rather than, "What am I resisting more than X?"<br><br>In your suggested method, how would you handle incoming items?

The result is that you will be working towards ever more difficult tasks. I used to liken this to cycling uphill.<br><br>If you use resistance, you will tend to do the opposite. I used to liken this to cycling downhill.<br><br>Cycling downhill is far faster and more efficient than cycling uphill (even as a metaphor).<br><br>One other important point is that using resistance as your criterion if you don't succeed in finishing your day list in time the tasks that will be left undone at the end of the day will tend to be easy trivial tasks. With psychological readiness the tasks left undone will tend to be the harder, more significant ones.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 March 2014 at 17:24 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Thank you for taking the time to explain. I have indeed encountered the problem with the FV of sometimes feeling like quitting as I approach the higher-resistance tasks. Indeed, funnily enough, I interrupted an FV chain I don't feel like continuing on to check this website. Maybe it was for the best. My only concern is that resistance comes from more than just, "I should really be getting work done on this now, but I'm dreading it," although that may be the biggest source. It also comes from, "This is really not quite ready to be done," or "Now is really not the best time to do this; my energy's low for it," etc. You talk about this a bit in "How to Make your Dreams Come True." How do I account for that sort of thing when using resistance as the criterion?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>27 March 2014 at 17:53 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>&lt;&lt;Like I said, it works best with a closed list.
