We all know (or at least have been told a million times) that if something has to be done RIGHT NOW, that trumps the list. That part I have no problem with. What I'm having a bit of a time wrapping my head around is this part of it. As Mark writes,<br><br>"If one or more very urgent things come up, write them at the end of the list and mark them with a dot so that they are done next. If something already on the list becomes very urgent, then move it to the end of the list and mark it with a dot in the same way."<br><br>This only works if those urgent things come up while you're CREATING the chain. If you're in the midst of working a chain, at best those urgent tasks are going to be the first thing that you do IN YOUR NEXT CHAIN. In most cases, I have found this to be perfectly adequate, and I find that I am much more likely to "little and often" the rest of my current chain if I have added higher-urgency things to the end of the list. But... for some reason my brain just doesn't want to accept this as the best way to handle those tasks of medium urgency.<br><br>Thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 March 2012 at 18:08 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Sarah - funny, I've had a similar thought i.e. If I'm mid-way through the chain, adding urgent items to the bottom won't get looked at. I have not doubt I'm missing something.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 March 2012 at 19:18 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>As I understand it, adding a task to the end of the list and dotting it means that you do that task next. This is true even when you are "in the midst of working the chain." (The idea is: always work on the dotted item that is closest to the end of the list.) The common-sense rule about urgency trumping the list, then, applies only to things that are so pressing that there isn't time to write them down. Otherwise urgency is accounted for on the list.<br><br>Tasks that don't need to be worked on quite so soon--that is, tasks of medium urgency?--get added to the end of the list undotted, ready to be selected for the next ladder, if you so choose when you construct that ladder.<br><br>It would be a bad idea to add lots of dotted items to the end of the list, because that would slow you down in climbing the ladder. But, understanding the rules this way, I've found it easy enough to distinguish between items that need to be worked on very soon, and items that can wait until the next ladder.<br><br>Note:<br><br>(1) That's how I understand the rules. I could be wrong.<br><br>(2) I, for one, like the term "ladder" better than the term "chain." There's something motivating about the image of climbing that ladder.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 March 2012 at 19:21 | isinger</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>@avrum I'm glad that I'm not the only one suffering from this particular bout of cognitive dissonance.<br><br>@isinger I think I'm inclined to agree with you about ladders versus chains.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 March 2012 at 20:01 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>The discussions I remember corroborated isinger's take: always work on the dotted item closest to the end of the list.<br><br>New items can be worked on immediately by dotting them, or left until next chain/ladder by not dotting them. Existing items can be added to the chain by dotting them where they already sit. If they are not low enough on the list to become your very next task, you can make them so by rewriting them to the end.<br><br>I am pretty sure Mark Forster confirmed this in one of these threads. Maybe someone will find it ...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 March 2012 at 20:54 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Agree with iSinger:<br><br>1) LADDER LADDER LADDER!<br>2) And if a new urgent item appears mid-climb, then drop down to the ground, insert the new rung, and restart the climb.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 March 2012 at 22:37 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Sarah:<br><br>&lt;&lt; "If one or more very urgent things come up, write them at the end of the list and mark them with a dot so that they are done next. &gt;&gt;<br><br>This means that the newly dotted task(s) is/are done just as soon as you finish the task you are currently working on. In other words they are added to the existing pre-selected list.<br><br>This should only be done when tasks are so urgent that they really can't wait. Otherwise just add them to the end of the list in the normal manner.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>30 March 2012 at 0:46 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Thanks Mark! I don't know why I couldn't get my brain wrapped around that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>30 March 2012 at 1:14 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I also get a sense that if you were in a "drop everything" situation, when you came back to your chain sitting where you left it, you could throw those items "as is" to the bottom of your list. Electronic methods cards that use objects for items are easy to sweep to the bottom of the list for when you come back.<br><br>Whatever you call it, chain, ladder, links, I think the take home message is that you are dynamically limiting your work in progress by literally embracing the algorithm. If you didn't, I can foresee when creating a "ladder" could actually be demotivating: when you reach too tall to take into account your complete sense of person, the current reality, and the supreme reign of time. <br><br>Think of all those Jewel casual video games-chains can be deliciously satisfying. But get too clever or preoccupied with linking up instead of clearing the screen, and you'll end up in a jam. That ladder will be the last ditch effort for climbing out of a hole.<br><br>If to begin, your list is really long from a brain dump, or you're trading out the selection criteria for less heuristic substitutions ("I 'should' do this now', Remember its Tuesday, etc.) Then your ladders would not be well-tempered to begin with. "Want" encompasses all this, including the need to drop everything and help. Right now. If for example you can remember to use ladders with 3-5 items, and you're gobbling up those little gremlins, then most likely "ladder"s working for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 April 2012 at 14:46 | James Levine</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Re: LADDER LADDER LADDER!<br><br>... and add some juicy reward at the top of the ladder?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 April 2012 at 17:30 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>But, LADDER implies climbing, which is work.

Forget your list.  When you are done, come back to your list.<br><br>For me, any time management system is there to make my life easier.  If a system makes me less productive, I drop that system.  FV has been great so far since it fits in the way that I already handle things in my life.  It fit like a glove.

Occasionally, an interruption (anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours) will change my mindset on what I want to do next in the interrupted chain. (for example - I'm two steps through a chain and I need to dash off to the emergency room for four hours because having kids is an adventure.)  <br><br>When I get back, either due to time or emotion, I no longer want to do the chain as it stands.  At that point, I usually cross off the entire chain, write what was left on the chain at the end of the main list and just start a new chain all over.  It seems to work better then forcing myself to finish the chain that was started and that I may not want to deal with currently.  If there was something pressing in the previous chain, it will usually show up in the new sequence.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>23 April 2012 at 11:06 | Bryan R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Chris Parker wrote:<br><br>&lt;&lt; If it is really an emergency, do it immediately.

At least, I usually don't.  :-)     Then when the emergency is done, I can return to FV and continue where I left off.<br><br>But if someone calls and says "I need this and that and this and that by lunchtime!" then I'd better write it all down and give them dots, otherwise I'll forget what they are.   After I process them, I can just keep working FV and continue with what I was doing before the "emergency".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>23 April 2012 at 17:22 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
