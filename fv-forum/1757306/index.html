I prefer to categorize them and keep those categories on-list so I review them regularly.<br><br>Nico: I would think you'd be intimately familiar with urgent items if you stick to doing them.  With SF you are obliged, but with FV you are equally able to keep doing them.  They are at the end of the list, you will visit them every round, and you can do them first each round.  If that's not enough, you can always mark them to stand out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 16:10 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I would put items for things months out, like "decide on summer vacation" in my tickler file for that later time.

You'll never want to do them before the current benchmark -- until it's time to start them. However, if you have too many of them, you'll spend a lot of time reading, comparing and rejecting the same items over and over. I'm using a week as the cutoff for now. I'll refine it as I use the system to see what works for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 19:12 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>You could keep everything (active &amp; inactive) in one list, highlight someday/maybe items and ignore them during regular passes through your list.  <br><br>Pre-FV I started adding tickler dates for future items in the left margin. These are ignored until the date comes. At that point, I re-enter at end of list. I do something similar for someday/maybe's (? In margin). It keeps EVERYTHING on one list without interfering with the AF/SF/FV mechanics. <br><br>It's easy to see when any item has been completed, tickled or dotted. Future/someday items are easily ignored while current items stand out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 19:18 | Scotthutchins</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I think any sort of external reminder would deal well with this issue, just as per the advice in the AF incarnations</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 19:32 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Perhaps in FV/AF systems "someday/maybe" is a project called "dreams" or "future"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 20:04 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>&lt;&lt;I would put items for things months out, like "decide on summer vacation" in my tickler file for that later time.

This action consists of adding it to my someday/maybe list. Then I cross it off. And I'd have a recurring action in the list: "check someday/maybe list", which would allow to reactivate the item in due time. This could be seen as a dismissal on item level.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 March 2012 at 22:42 | Marc (from Brussels)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>These approaches may work fine, but you could also just follow the rules as written, without involving any other lists:<br><br>Enter such items on the list like anything else.<br><br>At some point, one of those items may percolate to the top of the list -- the very first item.<br><br>As the rules indicate, if you CAN'T take any action right now on that item, then cross it off and add it to the end of the list.<br><br>But if you CAN take action, but just don't WANT to yet, that's different.   If the item is "no longer relevant" you can just delete it.   But it sounds like these are items that we probably do WANT to do, at least sometime.  FV is forcing us to ask ourselves, "Why not start now?"    "What could I do NOW to work towards completing this?"<br><br>Perhaps it's enough just to give the item a few minutes of thought -- "Do I really want to do this?  Should I offload this item into the tickler for a few months?"<br><br>Or maybe we can take five minutes to actually move the task forward.<br><br>There are many reasons why I find this approach very appealing:<br><br>It keeps these items on the main list, so they are frequently seen and filtered.<br><br>Items that I REALLY want to do, will actually see some action, early and often, which means I might actually accomplish the thing sometime.   If I bury it on a someday/maybe, where I rarely even see the item, it doesn't get any visibility or filtering.<br><br>By keeping the item always in my mind's eye, it allows my subconscious to process the item.<br><br>It forces me to stay real, and not offload things to the imaginary future where I have infinite time to do everything I want.<br><br>It keeps the system simple and straightforward.<br><br>This is the approach I am trying right now, and will try to follow for the first couple weeks at least.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 5:21 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Good answer, Seraphim.

My original interpretation of this rule was that it applies when I can't do something because of wrong location, missing input, unavailability of contributors etc.<br><br>In my case, I don't want to do the first item because I'm required to spend most of my time on other priorities and don't have any time to spare for this (for now). But thinking again, this could also be seen as a valid reason why I "can't" do it.<br><br>Is this an acceptable/intended interpretation of this rule?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 8:44 | Marc (from Brussels)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Marc,<br><br>From Seraphim's response, I would say that if you have other, more urgent, priorities, the "pure" way to play this would be to select the task and, when you get to it, simply move it to a tickler to remind you when you have more time. <br><br>That's how I'm playing these, and it seems to work well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 9:17 | will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Marc:<br><br>I have to admit that I've sometimes moved the first item to the end of the list in similar circumstances to those you describe. I think the key is that the system is there to help you get your work done, not to get in the way. So the question is whether doing this helps you do the work that needs to be done, or is just feeding your procrastination.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 10:42 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim: What is the difference between a tickler file and a someday/maybe list?

Cross out the item you want to dismiss but add something to distinguish it from a deleted item.  In my practice I place a "D" at the end.<br><br>2. Add "Review dismissed" item in FV list.<br><br>Now what have I done? I made sure that the "Someday/Maybe" items in my FV list are almost invisible to me during my usual use of FV, since they superficially look like deleted items. However, I am now forced to regularly review my "Someday/Maybe" (dismissed) items imbedded in the list because the item "Review dismissed" will, without fail, be included, sooner or later, in the FV algorithm.<br><br>Neat, eh?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 15:48 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I don't use a tickler for hard dates when things have to be done. That's my calendar.<br><br>A tickler is a reminder to start something. It can include a note of the deadline, but it isn't the deadline.<br><br>Having said that, I combine tickler and calendar on the same page. I look ahead on the calendar often enough that I see "Birthday" in time to put it on my task list and start getting a present. That process is routine. Reminders that don't need much preparation are included with the event. ("Bring scissors.")<br><br>However, some tasks aren't as routine. For them, I'll pick an early date and write "Plan 50th birthday party" well in advance of the party.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>15 March 2012 at 15:54 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Nico wrote:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Seraphim: What is the difference between a tickler file and a someday/maybe list?

It's easiest to explain with an example.  I have a "Monday" list with all the things I don't want to see until Monday.   When Monday does arrive, I move all those items to the end of my FV list.  (Or, in the past, to the end of my AF list.)

But I did today, and right the first item on my list was one that would belong on a "someday/maybe" list. I couldn't bring me to simply strike it out; I've put a cross (x) before it instead of a dot. My thought was: "As soon as the page is finished, I'll mark the page finished anyway (which I do with a big cross over it), and then I will mark the x-ed items with yellow text marker just as I usually did."<br><br>In doing so, a "someday/maybe list" is building itself.
