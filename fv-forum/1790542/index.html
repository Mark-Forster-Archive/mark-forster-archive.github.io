Nicole seems to concur.  I also tend to agree, which is why I still have many external lists of old stuff, which I inherited from pre-FV days.  <br><br>These lists are called-out from the main list.  When I look at one of these lists, my primary action now is to grab stuff from them and dump them into my FV list.  Over a month I've absorbed several externals, and created one new one, so the overall number of tasks seems to be shrinking, and the FV list remains a manageable length.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>18 April 2012 at 14:17 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>176. That's after consolidating three other lists. On Monday it was over 14 pages (plus the equivalent of 4 pages from other lists), now it's electronic. 143 are currently actionable, the rest have future dates. I expect another 20 from remaining lists.<br><br>The old notes took fewer lines than I expected, since many were duplicates or sub-tasks of bigger projects. The latter were mostly demoted to notes, with a few items promoted to lines of their own.<br><br>A few of my tasks are "gathering" tasks. "Room of the day" means pick one and work on it. I almost always want to do that once a day. On the other hand, if you give me a list of rooms I won't want to work on any of them. When I finish the room, I mark both "room of the day" and the actual room as actioned. It's the same with "outside work".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>18 April 2012 at 16:25 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Currently 105 active tasks, oldest one from 19th Feb 2012.<br>Down from 220 actives 5 weeks ago, with the oldest one at the time from 2nd Nov 2011.<br><br>Biggest effect of FV?

It's happened that way because, lately I've been resetting after long blocks of meetings, not having finished the chain.

All per the rules.  :-)<br><br>I am resetting like this because I have too many meetings and projects right now, and not enough discretionary time.

The biggest might be that you have a good feel for what your overall workload will be like (overloaded more now than normal and a reprieve in a couple of weeks).  But you also stick to it and know what is on your list.  Otherwise it would take longer than 20-30 minutes to scan a list of 600-900 items.

My list has grown to about 125, but this is due to me consolidating old lists onto my main FV list.  I feel that I must be between 70-90 items to get the most out of my list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 May 2012 at 7:06 | Nico McDonald</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>233 on one combined work and personal list.<br><br>103 on a "can put off indefinitely" list.

The last couple weeks have been crazy.   Up to over 1000, down to 700, back up to 952.   What a ride.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>20 May 2012 at 18:58 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>97. That's a little higher than usual because I'm in the throes of editing a paper so changes I need to make are getting entered as their own tasks. The oldest entry is 14 days old (which is up from my first month or so with FV, when most entries were dealt with in a week); only 21 (21.6%) of them are a week old or more.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 May 2012 at 15:09 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; @ Chris Cooper. Yes it's too long, I agree. :-) Totally new chain takes 20-30 minutes to set up. I just finished a chain this morning, for the first time in about a week.<br><br>This is the first time it's taken me so long to finish a chain. It's happened that way because, lately I've been resetting after long blocks of meetings, not having finished the chain. By "resetting" I mean clearing email and inboxes, and scanning from the last dotted item to the end of the list, for new items that I want to do before X. All per the rules. :-)<br><br>I am resetting like this because I have too many meetings and projects right now, and not enough discretionary time. But there are specific reasons for that, and a lot of this will go away in about two weeks. I expect to see the list significantly shorten after that. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Wow, that's a lot of time investment per chain.  No wonder you find yourself using that "partial reset" approach, especially when you get too busy.<br><br>30 minutes to make a chain from 900 items?  That's about 2 seconds of attention per item on average?  By chance, are you stopping at each item to consider "Do I want to do this before I do x?" rather than scanning the list looking for "What do I want to do before I do x?"  There was a previous thread that talked about the subtle difference between the two, and how scanning is maybe 10x faster than considering each task individually.  What if you scan rapidly and create short chains more often?<br><br>I don't have nearly as many items as you do (in the 50-100 range), but it doesn't take noticable time to create a chain because I'm scanning across most of the items I'm already familiar with, and most of the items I'm selecting are the high-priority items at the top of my list or the recent items at the end of my list, and I typically end up with about half a dozen items selected for the chain.<br><br>I just finished a chain as I was leaving work today.  If I remember, I'll try to time how long it takes to make a chain and give a count of how many items are on my list in total, but I don't think I give each item anywhere near 2 seconds of attention during the preselection process...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 May 2012 at 2:09 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Okay, I timed it.  I spent 70 seconds selecting a chain of 4 tasks from a list of 50 tasks.  That works out to 1.4 seconds per task, which is comparable.  I guess my list is short enough that the time to select a chain doesn't really register as significant.  Interesting.<br><br>It seems like 50-100 items is a lot more manageable than 500-1000...  Seraphim, how is it that you always have so many items coming in?  Is the granularity that fine, or are you including things that most of us wouldn't put in the list?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>22 May 2012 at 13:59 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I just have a lot going on.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>23 May 2012 at 1:45 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
