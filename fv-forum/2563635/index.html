Instead of scanning forward and then working backward, I'm scanning backward and then working forward.<br><br>This is done with one "current initiative" which acts as the root task. The current initiative can be selected from any part of the list, and is dotted as the first task in the chain. Scanning backwards through the list then takes place in the same way as FVP but in the opposite direction. Once some work has been done on the current initiative, it is crossed out and re-entered with a dot at the end of the list. This procedure is repeated until the current initiative is finished.<br><br>When work on the current initiative has been finished, another current initiative is chosen and the same procedure followed.<br><br>I've only been doing this for a bit over a day, but the results so far are really excellent. I'm already on my third current initiative - these are things which have been hanging around for months! <br><br>I'll write at more length (perhaps in a blog post) in due course of time, but I'd encourage anyone who feels like having a go at it to do so.

Currently I'm still having to make an effort to reverse my downward-scanning habit into an upward-scanning one, but that'll soon be a reflex. <br><br>More seriously, I'm a little troubled by how to work newly arrived urgent tasks into the algorithm. In FVP they're placed at the bottom of the list, and they're scanned as soon as a single task from the selection has been done. That should be soon enough. But in RFVP they're not scanned until the whole current selection has been worked on, back down to the current initiative. That can take an indefinite amount of time.<br><br>So the algorithm itself doesn't seem to guarantee that something that's same-day urgent will be reached in time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 December 2015 at 16:39 | Chris Cooper</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim and Chris:<br><br>I've been working a bit more on this (as well as with it) and my current method of doing it is that, Instead of selecting a "current initiative", I use the first active task on the list. I cross it out and re-enter it at the end of the list with a dot, and it then is worked as "current initiative" as described above.<br><br>Chris raises the point about really urgent tasks. The easy answer is to enter them at the beginning of the list (you can leave a blank page, column or piece of paper specially for this). I haven't actually tried this yet myself, but it should work fine. If one of them becomes the current initiative as the result of doing this, that's probably all to the good.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>21 December 2015 at 16:46 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Just wondering if I have this right.<br><br>Here's my list:<br><br>Buy Christmas presents<br>Wash dishes<br>Get ready for work<br>Plan anniversary dinner<br>Make a dentist appointment<br>Take a nap<br>Pack for trip up north<br>Work on resume<br>Clean up apartment<br>Write for 10 minutes<br><br>First thing I do is dot the top item as in normal FVP:<br><br>*Buy Christmas presents<br>Wash dishes<br>Get ready for work<br>Plan anniversary dinner<br>Make a dentist appointment<br>Take a nap<br>Pack for trip up north<br>Work on resume<br>Clean up apartment<br>Write for 10 minutes<br><br>Now I start scanning from "Write for 10 minutes" going up.

I have a question.<br><br>With my own Current Initiative tweak, the first thing I'd do, after selecting my Current Initiative, would be to think, "what do I need to do to get this done?" and write it all down as the next items on my FVP list.  <br><br>This didn't work with Reverse FVP, because I'd write all those things down at the end of my list, but the algorithm would take me in exactly the opposite direction!  :-)<br><br>So then I tried your Dynamic List idea (as you suggested here at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2560976#post2561011">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2560976#post2561011</a> , and described in the "Sowing Seeds" chapter (ch. 31) of your new book):   I would just take a stickie note, and write down all the things I wanted to get done with the current initiative.   And then bang through that list.  Or maybe sketch it out on my white board, and work from there.   When I got the initiative done, I'd just throw away the note.  (So far, I've stuck with each current initiative till it got done -- which is pretty amazing actually.  But I'm not sure what I'd do with the note if I decided to stop before finishing.  I guess I'd just set the note aside.)<br><br>Using a side note actually seems to work pretty well.  It keeps my FVP list lighter/nimbler, and just feels more alive/engaging.  It also seems to make me want just to get it done!<br><br>But I'm wondering how you handle this.<br><br>Thanks!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>29 December 2015 at 21:43 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Seraphim:<br><br>I use a dynamic list, yes.
