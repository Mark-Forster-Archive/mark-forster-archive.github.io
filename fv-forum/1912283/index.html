That is not the main problem with FV nor is that a problem at all.<br><br><br>"Some tasks are not worthy enough to be reviewed multiple times till it gets on top to be dismissed."<br><br>... All tasks you have committed to doing are worthy enough to be reviewed multiple times until you DO THEM. If it's on your FV list you have committed to doing it. There is no dismissal in FV.<br><br><br>"My theory is that Mark also discovered this and that is why he has abandoned this site."<br><br>... You're not a very skilled analyst then. You've received FV and loads of solid advice for years for free; Mark has a wife, children, a family, errands, things to plan, a retirement to enjoy, holidays, summer travel, and a list of tasks that don't involve this FREE website.<br><br>"The truth", is that your powers of observation are lacking and your comment is buoyant with smugness.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>4 August 2012 at 22:56 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>&gt;Some tasks are not worthy enough to be reviewed multiple times till it gets on top to be dismissed.<br><br>why can't you dismiss a task anywhere on the list when you realize it's dismiss-able?

It's occurred to me that in previous systems Mark has stressed that AF and it's variations should be used for discretionary and unscheduled time. Not necessarily for the whole work-day.<br><br>I've mentioned before that I tend to use a variation of AF2 when I know what I want to get through that day or part of day.<br><br>If you take the view that all the tasks on your list need to be done at some point (or kicked off the list if they don't) then I've not seen a more coherent system for actually eating through the list. Your tasks are the same whatever system you use, you just need to use the right tool at the right time.<br><br>But no system will help if you continually overload yourself with commitments.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>6 August 2012 at 12:24 | Caibre65</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Mark has taught me a lot. I no longer use any of his systems, but the following ideas continue to influence my own workflow: <br><br>* little and often<br>* working on tasks/projects that "stand out"<br>* some form of dismissal <br>* pen/paper vs computer<br><br>I'm also curious what happened to Mark, and if he still uses FV, AF...  If he is writing a book, I hope it's a synthesis of his ideas, and not so much a "how to" re: FV. Either way, I'll purchase as a token of support.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>6 August 2012 at 12:58 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>Avrum,<br><br>I too am curious as to what Mark is doing, I certainly hope he is enjoying his retirement.  There comes a time when I think we all realize a TM system is only as good as the user and the will and motivation to get things accomplished can trump or derail any system.<br><br>That said, I am curious what you are using if you abandoned Mark's methods.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>6 August 2012 at 15:59 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>I think "the truth"'s speculations about Mark's absence are grossly unfair.<br><br>Awhile ago Mark said he was very busy.   He was also spending time with family.   Good for him!   Though he made a career out of time management, I always had the impression his life is much bigger than time management.   "The truth" is reading an awful lot into his absence.<br><br>All of Mark's systems have had tradeoffs and emphasized different sets of features.   Mark was usually among the first to identify the shortcomings in his own systems, but that never led him to "quit and go away".  On the contrary, since the introduction of AF1, it led to more than three years of incredible creativity, productivity, and development and sharing of a series of insights into what makes time management work.   <br><br>Gerry asked - "I am curious what you are using if you abandoned Mark's methods"<br><br>I started a new thread on the General forum to discuss this:  <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1913954">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1913954</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>6 August 2012 at 21:28 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>"The main problem with FV is that not all tasks are created equal.

For me, this happens to one or two tasks during every preselection cycle - it's a natural byproduct of using the list as a "grasscatcher" - you are going to write down some things that were passing fancies and then the structured procrastination of system gives you time to realize that rather than tilting at those windmills right away.<br><br>I, too, will pile on the "hope Mark is doing well" bandwagon.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>7 August 2012 at 18:43 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-45p6sodx> <div data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>...

I think this is a feature, not a bug.<br><br>If you follow the rules of FV, the tasks that are not "worthy" of multiple review (or action) will have likely been deleted long before they make it to the top spot.   And if they didn't get deleted by then, the top-spot-forcing-function forces you to delete them.   It takes about a tenth of a second.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-45p6sodx>14 August 2012 at 19:00 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
