<p>What I required was a system which fulfils the following criteria:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Flexible</li>
<li>Comprehensive</li>
<li>No resistance</li>
<li>Any length of list</li>
<li>No pressure to do any particular tasks</li>
<li>Relies entirely on intuition, i.e. <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/25/standing-out.html">“standing out”</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Not a lot to ask.</p>
<p>I came to two conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only one system ticks all the above boxes and that is Simple Scanning (scanning round and round the list doing whatever stands out <em>without</em> any formal method of clearing undone tasks). This is a very annoying conclusion for me because I first started using Simple Scanning in 1997 and have spent the past twenty years trying to invent a better system. The reason I did this is because at the time I didn’t understand <em>what</em> it was the best system for.</li>
<li>More important than which system you use is that once you’ve chosen one you stick to it. None of my theories about the long list will work if one keeps changing systems. Again this is a very annoying conclusion for me because I could have spent the last twenty years becoming a multi-billionaire and secret ruler of the world. Not too late now perhaps…&nbsp;<span>mwahahaha!</span></li>

<p>Finally, a bit more background reading:</p>

Would your list not get very long over time filled with stuff you will probably never do?  Or are you proposing a less formal approach - just delete the task if/when you feel like it or find you have no intention of ever doing it?

What I am trying to avoid is anything in the system itself which puts pressure on particular tasks, because that interferes with the intuitive process. <br><br>Once a task feels dead, you can and should delete it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 October 2017 at 15:10 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>A quote for you from TS Eliot: "We shall not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time."<br><br>re dismissal -- It seems logical that if we trust our intuition on what to do, we can also trust it on what NOT to do, and what tasks 'stand out' for dismissal. <br><br>For me, what interferes with intuition is the monkey-mind/ego trying to 'figure things out' and optimize a system (simple scanning) that appears not to be improved by optimization. <br><br>Trusting our subconscious to take care of the big picture for us (we're the cursor on the screen while the subconscious sees the entire screen) is a big ask, esp. in the kinds of work environments the readers of this blog work in. I suppose the end result is we will all derive our own interpretation, or not, of this 'non-method' and if it works, we won't be able to say how or why.<br><br>On a different note, this perspective is all kind of slotting into how I'm viewing some spiritual issues in my life, the "let go and let God" perspective.

I am attempting to be more efficient but it is  backfiring on  me. And to make it worse, while I am doing one task I think of 4+ more to add to my list. It keeps getting longer. Gah.

I was going to say firmly that most people do not make short lists, leave each thing on the list until it's complete, then scratch it out, and eventually throw away the list.<br><br>Then I thought about how I handle projects and super-short plans. That's exactly how I handle it. I also like scratching things off, so will often subdivide a task so I have something to scratch off after each work session. When I struggle to focus, I sometimes make a list for just the hour, and reward myself with tearing up the entire list when it's done (or drawing a big X over it if it's in my notebook).<br><br>For longer plans and my catch-all list, though, I work the other way. I rarely finish the list. When I've worked on something long enough, I cross it out and re-enter. (Technically, it's already re-entered on my grid, but it's still crossed out and on next-day's list.)<br><br>I think of myself the latter-way. Long list, cross off and re-enter when done for the day, many lines never get done at all. <br><br>My mother and most administrators I've worked with make a list each day, often on a small page-a-day calendar. When the day's done, they DDD what's left. Sometimes the page becomes a diary of what they did. If they use that page for incoming notes, it's on a distinctly different part. Their written list is usually non-routine, smallish things. Routines and large things, that I would normally put on my long list, stay in their memory, or maybe calendar if they need to block out time, say for a trip to the offsite library or a large project that can't be started early.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 October 2017 at 16:21 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Nico, I like that system!

It helps you train your brain to stay focused, a little bit at a time. (Currently, I'm failing. Got through half a pom and had this great idea to type up...) You can start with shorter poms if you like. I only use the timer part of the system, not the way the author does lists.

Yes I will intuitively pick that big project each time I see it, but when there are 100 little things that require 5 minutes of my time, and 2 big things that require some hours of my time (but not necessarily unbroken hours), the straight scanning does not create that focus I want.  The 100 little things collectively tend to outweigh the 2 big things, which I only see after running through all the little things.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>13 October 2017 at 1:44 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>If one or both of the two big things are urgent then one would expect that to be picked up by your intuition.<br><br>For non-urgent big things they will begin to stand out to your intuition once the surrounding little things have been dealt with.

I've seen this referenced while I've been searching for a system, and struck it off because I don't think I have the self-discipline. But possibly if I try to work it into another system, one of Mark's, using them together it might help.

The method was invented to CREATE self-discipline.  You don't start with 25/5, you start with whatever you believe you can pull off, maybe 5 minutes before a break.  Afte you get good at that, you increase the timer as a stretch goal.  You also don't do 25/5 for 8 solid hours.  You do a few then take a longer break.  Again, if you don't have the discipline start with a couple.  Over time you challenge yourself to do more pomodoros, thus developing in yourself the self-discipline. (Well, now you don't need to read the original story, I just told you what it was about.)<br><br>"Do they sell a tomato timer that will reach out and slap you upside the head"<br><br>A timer app like I use with my iPhone could do the slapping for you.  I like "30/30", which lets me set up a 25minute time, and then I get an alarm signaling a 5 minute break, then another alarm signalling time to start up again.  I can also do followup alarms should i ignore the first one, or a 3-minute warning in advance to prepare me to stop.  (Of course this is the same spirit as snoozes on your normal alarm clock.  Ultimately I suppose they are a bad idea because they might establish a habit of ignoring the original alarm.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>17 October 2017 at 3:42 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I was struck by Henry Moore's statement on intuition (standing out?) : "It is a mistake for a sculptor or a painter to speak or write very often about his job. It releases tension needed for his work.
