The lack of speed was due to the fact that the scanning algorithm involves often having to repeatedly scan most of the list.</p>
<p>So I set out to find a way of making FVP fast. This would obviously require making some changes to the scanning algorithm. As usual when I’m dealing with problems of this nature, I found that the answer was staring me in the face.</p>
<p>All I had to do was to change the algorithm so that whenever a task is dotted which I am ready to do right now I stop scanning and do it. That’s all there is to it - it’s as simple as that, but the effect on the speed of the system is enormous.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, the question asked during the scanning becomes a double question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>1) Am I ready to do this now?</em></p>
<p>If the answer is “yes”, do it.</p>
<p>If the answer is “no”, ask the second question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>2) What do I want to do more than this?</em></p>
<p>In practice these get abbreviated to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>1) Ready?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>2) More?</em></p>
<p>Apart from this alteration the scanning proceeds exactly as it does in standard FVP. This simple change saves an enormous amount of scanning time.</p>
<p><strong>A word of caution</strong></p>
<p>It seems a bit strange to say this but this system is almost too fast. It’s like trying to ride a thoroughbred racehorse when you’re only used to a pony. I have found that I have a tendency to do so much work with it that I actually end up exhausting myself. So be sure to take plenty of breaks. Good luck!</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>So do you essentially only have a chain of 1 selected task?

Worth adding some speculation on how "Am I ready?" might work I think.<br><br>According to Psychology Today..."Your head brain reasons, analyzes, synthesizes, and makes meaning of what is perceived. Your heart brain activates based on how the presenting situation relates to your dreams and desires, including your hopes, disappointments and feelings of betrayal if you feel promises were broken. Your gut brain reacts when your fear is triggered, whether the threat is real or you are just afraid of letting go of what you now have.

It lifts a huge mental load off of deciding what to do next. I am almost always doing something useful, and there's no effort to scan the list. There is a clear feeling of when I'm working on the list and when I'm not productive doing something else, and I keep coming back to the list.  Things that I would normally skip over in a catch-all list, I end up thinking "Am I ready to start this? Well, I could spend a few minutes checking on X, or thinking about Y related to this", and just like that I am doing something useful without having to motivate myself.

I actually delete all tasks up to the first incomplete task, to manage my list size.  Inadvertently, this creates rewarding pressure for older tasks, because there have been times where just doing that first task on the list I have been putting off, will result in my list getting culled by 30 or more tasks because I have completed the 29 tasks after it already.  It gives a very satisfying tetris effect, like when you line up four rows of blocks and sneak that long one right into the slot and they all disappear!  :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>17 August 2019 at 0:59 | John</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>John, <br>I've been using your ideas with Dynalist for a month now. I love it. Guess it is the color thing. Also I like the way the older things do stand out.<br><br>Are you using the free version or the pro?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>17 September 2019 at 0:55 | Erin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Dynalist seems to be basically a rehash of the very simple and useful Outliners we used to have back in the days of DOS programs (before most of you were born). They went out of fashion when programs got more and more sophisticated and dependent on graphic interfaces (i.e. complicated, incomprehensible and unreliable).<br><br>I used to use PC-Outliner all the time. It can sort of be replicated on Evernote, but nothing like as well. Of course Evernote can do a trillion things PC-Outliner couldn't do, but I still miss the old program.<br><br>Thanks for bringing it to my attention.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>17 September 2019 at 14:01 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'm using Dynalist, have for well over a year.
