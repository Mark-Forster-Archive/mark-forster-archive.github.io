<p><strong>A Message from Mark Forster’s Son</strong></p>
<p>It is with deep sadness that I share the news of my father, Mark Forster’s passing. He died peacefully in his sleep late on Sunday, 12th October 2025, without pain.</p>
<p>For nearly a year, my father had been living with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), a condition that arose following two previous battles with cancer. In recent months, MDS affected his memory, making it increasingly difficult for him to manage his website.</p>
<p><em>Get Everything Done</em> has been a central part of his life since he published his first book over twenty years ago. He took great joy in the community that grew around it and was proud to play even a small role in helping others improve their lives.</p>
<p>On his behalf, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to <em>Get Everything Done -&nbsp;</em>whether through conversation, support, or shared ideas. Your presence meant a great deal to him.</p>
<p>Matthew</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I've spent a lot of time reading this site over the years.

I appreciated his willingness, even relish, in recognising weaknesses in an approach and working on improvements or trying new ideas. In a world of people claiming they can "change your life" and "smash it!", it has always been refreshing to come back to this calm, thoughtful place, and read Mark simply encouraging me to try new things and see what works for me.<br>Than you Mark and may you rest in peace</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>15 October 2025 at 8:19 | Richard</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Thank you for giving us this sad news, Matthew.

The way he boiled his systems down into simple rules clicked with my brain, and helped me survive college. After that, I'd continue coming back to see what new ideas he'd cooked up. I loved how down-to-earth and humble he was, always experimenting, sharing, discussing with others here, not claiming to be an all-knowing "guru."

Mark was such an original thinker and the generosity of his time and sharing over the years has been extraordinary. I still remember browsing the bookshop where I found Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play. The title was just right. Mark surprised and delighted with new thinking, often so simple and so creative. Same again when 'Dreams' came out, then at one of his seminars on the early DIT system. By coincidence I picked up a notebook and pen a few days ago and went from electronic Simple Scanning back to original Autofocus. I remember the anticipation that Christmas all those years ago as Mark teased the new system, and then the joy of running with it. I've been re-reading the forum entries from back at the Autofocus launch and re-living the whole thing.

He thought clearly and explained carefully. He constantly tested and refined his ideas, always looking for improvements. His insights were often profound and his ideas, while always simple to implement, were often revelatory in their impact.
