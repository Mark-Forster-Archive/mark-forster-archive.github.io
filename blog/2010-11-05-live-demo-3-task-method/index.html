<p>I will only be showing those tasks which are actually being worked on in the 3-Task system. The system is being fed by an AF4 list which will not be shown.</p>
<p>The two things I particularly want to achieve tomorrow are to go for a long walk and to write a plan for our church fund raising campaign. I would also like to remain on top of all routine matters (email, paper, housekeeping, etc) and to watch a movie on DVD at some stage. If I can, I would also like to plan the workshop I am giving in Leuven in two weeks time, and make progress on my income tax return.</p>
<p>All tasks contain three stages: Preparation, the Task itself, and Clearing Up. A task is not complete until all three of those stages have been carried out.</p>
<p>I’ll be starting the day with only two items on my list as one was completed yesterday.</p>
<p>Key: <strong>Bold type </strong>shows when a task is first introduced onto the 3-Task list. When a task is shown in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">strikeout</span> it has been completed. Therefore if a task is in both <strong>bold</strong> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">strikeout</span> then it was completed in one go. If a task has been worked on but not struck out, it remains on the 3-Task list. My comments are in [square brackets]</p>

<p>[I think some people are having difficulty in following what is happening, so to make it easier to follow I am changing the way the list is presented. Tasks will only be struck through when they are completed. I hope that will make it easier to see what tasks are on the list at any one time. I’ll also put tasks in bold when they come onto the 3-Task list for the <strong>first time</strong>]</p>

<p>[I have now got to the end of the open list in AF4. So there should be weightier matters ahead!]</p>
<p>[A couple of general observations so far: 1) There is quite a considerable overhead involved in putting this all on the blog - so things are moving slower than normal; 2) The dynamic of AF4 is changed by using it with the 3-Task system because all re-entries onto the open list are “empty”, i.e. there is no outstanding work on them.]</p>

<p>1857 “Downton Abbey” [for the non-Brits among you, this is a TV series that has been enthralling the nation]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Income Tax Return (next section)</p>
<p>I ended after watching Downton Abbey. So how did I do? Looking back on what I said I would like to do during the day, I see I did all of it. The only thing I could have working on further was my income tax return, and I will carry on with that tomorrow.</p>
<p>I mentioned in one of my comments in square brackets that the 3-Task method changes the dynamics of AF4.&nbsp; If you look at my list of tasks above you will see that the unfinished tasks which I had more than one go at were:</p>
<p>Re-number bins<br>Email<br>Breakfast<br>Walk<br>Leuven Presentation<br>Newsletter<br>Income Tax Return</p>
<p>In ordinary AF4 all these would all have been moved to the open list and the concentration which I brought to them would have been dissipated. So all in all I am extremely pleased with my efforts today and convinced of the benefits of using the 3-Task method with AF4.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hurrah!<br><br>Another "Test Match Special" of task management kicks off.

I like the fact that it can work with other time management systems so the focus is on 3 tasks, as although I'm familiar with Autofocus, I haven't closely followed the development of it and have mainly stuck with an amended version of DIT for my own system, using 'Things' software.  Today I'm working with pen and paper in a couple of small Moleskines and have put a list of 'Autofocus tasks' in one and am using the other for the three tasks lists.  Fascinating stuff, thanks for sharing and I enjoyed Mark McGuinness's post you linked to about tasks on post-it notes too.

The dismissal rules are what sets it apart for me; although AF4 is just almost as good to my work style --- but not quite there now I have tried both systems extensively.<br><br>[ In reply to comment: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2010/11/7/the-rules-by-which-i-ran-the-demo.html#comment10482591">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/11/7/the-rules-by-which-i-ran-the-demo.html#comment10482591</a> ]<br><br>I have started trying the 3-task method with DWM (in fact DWM2, which is just a change in the format, but not in the rules). That is something I had noticed: although everything is running smoother than ever (no paper or e-mail backlogs, no burning the midnight oil to chase looming deadlines), I have not tackled everything that I should have.<br><br>For instance, my computer files. Although I have multiple backups in place, a server, good and running work directories, some of my personal files are running wild. My personal laptop is running out of space. Everything I have done was palliative, as I work very, very little on this task in any form of DIT--AF--DWM. What to do? I need a plan to *finish* a lot of things like this.<br><br>Most of such tasks are just dismissed with time, but once in a while something runs out of control (no more disk space!) and I put them on my list again, do some small thing to keep everything from breaking apart; but eventually task gets dismissed again because I just do not properly finish it.<br><br>So far (well, 1.5 day after processing my list with the 3-task method), I see how I focused more on finishing things. Now I have a plan for those projects that come and go and come back to the list and *have* to be dealt with.<br><br>Mark: When you commit to a task and something prevents it from being acted upon (as your "Email" above), how should one deal with it?  Imagine your e-mail server is down for a whole day --- do you still keep that task on your 3-task list, occupying one of the slots? I am having trouble finding some of sort of rule or guidance that both allows me to deal with this type of situation and does not weaken my commitment to finish a chosen task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 November 2010 at 16:15 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Natalia:<br><br>If I knew my email was definitely down for a long period and there was nothing I could do about it except wait, then no, I wouldn't keep it on my 3-Task list.<br><br>If on the other hand there was something I could do about it (which was the case when my email went down at the start of the demo) then I would keep it on my list and my action to remedy the problem would fall under that heading.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 November 2010 at 16:26 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark: So, in the case where you can do something about the e-mail, do you change your "finished" goal? For instance, all you could do was call your e-mail provider; you did that and they said your e-mail would be back in 30 minutes. Would you cross that task out? Would that depend on how much time it would take it to come back?<br><br>Thanks for your answer! I am sure I will be able to gauge these situations myself in time, but I came across some of them yesterday and I am still afraid things will not work if I am not stricter with my 3-task list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 November 2010 at 17:09 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Natalia: Glad someone else has had the same good experience with DWM.<br><br>Re emails, same here, but life is a balance and I think the other things I have done instead have been more important, I just deal with the key correspondence. But I am working on strategies to ease the constant barrage of email I think we all get nowadays - Gmail's priority inbox, automatic filtering and so on.<br><br>Likewise re disk space etc, sometimes the right thing to do is work on infrastructure ("get and install new laptop", or "set up 25GB Skydrive account").</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 November 2010 at 18:23 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>@Natalia<br><br>Dismissal rules, yes crucial, and DWM gives me a steady list size, more or less.<br><br>With all the AF systems, the list got inexorably longer and longer, and I don't see why things would be different with the triple task adaptation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 November 2010 at 18:39 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Natalia:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Would that depend on how much time it would take it to come back? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, I think the basic question here is whether keeping it on your list is helping you get your work done or getting in its way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 November 2010 at 0:22 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Laurence:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I don't see why things would be different with the triple task adaptation. &gt;&gt;<br><br>One reason could be that 3-T helps you to tackle the more difficult tasks.

If you leave that to the conscious mind, you reject the whimsical idea that would change your life. So I think the strong dismissal of DWM, and its link to the calendar, was inspired as a way to deal with the ever-growing list, and I follow (and applaud!!) your original idea of throwing everything at the list, which you still refer to at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/</a> where the full instructions for Autofocus 1 begin thus:<br><br>Full Instructions<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br><br>As you think of new items, add them to the end of the list.<br><br>One of the characteristics of this system is that you can chuck anything at it.

The system itself will do the evaluation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 November 2010 at 12:18 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Laurence:<br><br>I think one gets into a different mindset when using 3-T or a similar system. I'm finding with my new version of AF1 that, although I haven't changed the rule about throwing everything at the list, nevertheless it is growing far more slowly than it did with the original AF1. I am not consciously rejecting displacement activities.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 November 2010 at 14:37 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I think this explains it:<br>With AF1, thinking of things to do is usually far displaced from doing things.  Also, doing things is very easy because you do a little bit, and the item disappears for a long time.  Also, because you are doing such a variety of things, a similar variety of new ideas come up.  So adding to the list is easy and fun, and there's no immediate negative consequence, so it happens lots.<br><br>The one thing that really curtails new ideas is to be narrowly preoccupied with one big thing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 November 2010 at 15:32 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'm looking forward to seeing details of the new AF1 methodology soon.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 November 2010 at 16:29 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Laurence:<br><br>It's worked very well today so far, but AF1 always requires a bit of time for the list to evolve.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 November 2010 at 18:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>With each AF or DWM system, I've always learned new ways of thinking and developed new habits.

Visualizing a paper-based system based on typed descriptions in a blog or Twitter format is hard for me--I really liked the slide-based demo someone put together of Mark's AF4 demo, and had to do much the same in Excel to recreate what he was doing.
