<ul>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Flexible</li>
<li>Comprehensive</li>
<li>No resistance</li>
<li>Any length of list</li>
<li>No pressure to do any particular tasks</li>
<li>Relies entirely on intuition, i.e.&nbsp;<a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/25/standing-out.html">“standing out”</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve been working on this system for months now trying to get it exactly right. As always when I finally arrive, the answer is very simple.</p>
<p>Getting high speed and high volume is largely a matter of reducing resistance to as close to zero as it’s possible to get, plus having a scanning system which doesn’t get in the way. Once that’s been achieved everything else becomes much easier - because if you’re going to do everything and do it fast the concerns about urgent items, backlogs, unstarted projects, length of the list, etc, just fall away.</p>
<p>You also of course get enormous energy just by the fact that you are on top of things.</p>

I currently have areas of focus (some personal, some work-related) and try to have at least one active item from each area.  I then circulate along the long list using either a randomized or simple scanning approach, in the spirit of what Mark and others have been discussing recently.<br><br>I use an active task "Process email" to rapidly get all tasks out of email into the catch-all list, because this is the lowest-resistance approach that works best for me.  I use an active task "Reset" to quickly (~5min) review the tasks in my areas of focus to make sure there is the 1+ active tasks per area.  <br><br>Using OmniFocus as my catch-all list, this email-to-catch-all list approach works pretty quickly with the MailDrop feature, but I can imagine with a written catch-all list that this might be more tedious...<br><br>Would love to hear how others do it!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 November 2017 at 12:57 | Bernard</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Bernard:<br>That is interesting about - <br>"I use an active task "Process email" to rapidly get all tasks out of email into the catch-all list"<br><br>Can you expand on what you do to actually get the tasks from email into the catch-all list and how long does that take? <br><br>I read Michael Linenberger method sometime ago and that advocated moving email into Toodledo task list or Outlook tasks, but I could not see the point of that and it just added processing time of having information in 2 places.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 November 2017 at 13:22 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark, you certainly know how to set up a cliffhanger!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 November 2017 at 14:02 | skeg</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>You're such a tease!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 November 2017 at 14:34 | eurobubba</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>MrBacklog:<br><br>&lt;&lt; However, can you cover what should actually go on the task list and why. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Basically whatever you want to put on it.

Should some of those tasks generated from email be written in to the task list, or should the task list just contain "do email"? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Personally I would put every task arising from email on the list.

That's why I try to have everything on my one single list (which actually is two lists, one for private stuff and one for work stuff, but that's a context switch I seem to need).<br><br>That's how I handle email, you'll have to find out what works for you - your mind might work differently and your context is most likely different (I receive far less emails than you do).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 November 2017 at 18:44 | Ruth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>MrB,<br><br>I too get a lot of (sometimes implied) tasks via email.  Not processing my Inbox to zero means that I'm building up a backlog, regardless of whether I've copied these tasks onto my list. Lately it's getting bad.  I sometimes Flag a message that I can't deal with sufficiently in the moment, but I regard this as bad practice. So how to process to zero without getting overwhelmed?  Here are a few tricks:<br><br>1. Reply quickly with a short answer when possible.  This keeps the ball moving, so to speak, and follow-up emails are sure to arrive if you haven't actually completed the task. It also makes you look good to those expecting a response.<br><br>2. Print out the email and put it in a project folder or tickler folder, to remind yourself to take action later, then archive it. Printouts are great for jotting down ideas and taking related notes during meetings or phone calls.<br><br>3. Write the next action onto your list with a reference to the email date and sender, then just archive it. When you do start this task, the reference points you back to the message for context for further work, or just to make it easy to find and reply back to the sender.<br><br>I'm going to follow my own advice now and deFlag and Zero my Inbox!<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/z9UjeTMb3Yk">http://youtu.be/z9UjeTMb3Yk</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 November 2017 at 18:47 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>MrBacklog:<br><br>&lt;&lt; If I were to write those action tasks down into the catch all list, it would take quite a bit of admin time to do that.
