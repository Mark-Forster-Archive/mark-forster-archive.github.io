<p><em>Brief description</em></p>
<p>DWM2 does away with the page-a-day diary used in <a href="http://www.markforster.sqarespace.com.blog/2011/1/26/review-of-the-systems-dwm-day-week-month.html">DWM</a>, and instead uses a single list in which new tasks are marked with a small black circle or other suitable sign. Otherwise the system is the same as DWM.</p>
<p><em>Advantages</em></p>
<p>An ordinary notebook can be used instead of a page-a-day diary, there is no wasted space on pages and all tasks are entered or re-entered at the end of the list instead of having two entry points.</p>
<p>Otherwise the advantages and disadvantages are the same as for DWM.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>This is a rather faster and more convenient version of DWM.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Above you provided a link to your DWN2 system but unless you changed the title of DWN2 to AF (this is all confusing for a newbie to your site, which I'm finding fascinating), the link seems to be wrong.  Could you please clarify?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>21 October 2013 at 20:12 | Julliette</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi, Julliette,<br><br>Yes, I'm sorry for the confusing nature of the site. It's been a hotbed of experimentation and the experiments have sometimes moved faster than the organization of the site! <br><br>The link you refer to is to a comment,not to a post.
