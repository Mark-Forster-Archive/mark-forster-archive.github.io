So I think it would be a good idea to use a blog post to repeat and amplify my replies to those comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that the main qualifications for an HITM system are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses a catch-all to-do list (“long list”)</li>
<li>You only work on what feels ready to be done</li>
<li>You only work on that for as long as you feel like it.</li>
<li>There is no compulsion to do one task rather than another</li>
<li>Every task is available to be the next task you work on&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Subject to these any suitable scanning method may be used. The one I currently recommend is <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/12/2/simple-scanning-the-rules.html">Simple Scanning</a>, but I’m convinced that I can find a better way. I’m currently testing another system which may prove more suitable - or not. However what I’m about to say applies to any qualifying system.</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>
<p>There are<em> two aspects</em> to speed.<em> First</em>, there is the amount of time it takes to scan for the next task. On the one hand there would be a FIFO system in which you just do the tasks in the order they are written on the list. There would be effectively no time spent scanning at all. On the other hand would be a system in which you have to scan the entire list each time before selecting the next task. With a large list scanning would take a long time.</p>
<p><em>The second aspect</em> is that speed is not just going through the whole list fast, but also doing the work fast. If you are bored and unmotivated your work slows to a crawl. But if you are fired up, you work much faster - and better too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the two aspects contradict themselves to some extent. If you tried to do your work in a strictly FIFO order, you would probably end up bored to tears and very unmotivated. Any time saved in scanning would be easily outweighed by the slow speed of the actual work.</p>
<p>The ideal system has to be one in which the scanning time is kept as low as possible, but in which the emphasis is on keeping interest and motivation going.</p>
<p><strong><span>Direction</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It refers to giving direction to your life - as opposed, at the other extreme, to drifting aimlessly.</span></p>
<p>The idea behind HITM is that you have a big list which contains everything you might want to do. It’s then by working the list that you discover what you really do want to do. Anything that you decide that you are not going to do gets weeded out. As I think I’ve said before, I think the precise mechanism is less important than the approach. Unlike other approaches where not getting everything on the list done is seen as a failure, with HITM not getting everything done is seen as a success, i.e. it’s what’s supposed to happen. It’s the way you discover what you really want and ride the wave. In short it is what is called “being in the flow”.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I like the concept of everything on one list, but I have not been able to do that as mine would be way too long.

Or to put it another way, if it's not on the list then what's happening to it? If you're getting it done anyway, then there's no reason not to put it on the list. If it's just sitting there with nothing happening to it, then weed it out. <br><br>There is a limit to how much work one person can do. If you have more work than that, you are faced with the choice of 1) skimping all your work so as to maintain the illusion of progress, 2) letting huge backlogs build up with an inevitable day of reckoning, or 3) weeding your work down to what you can actually manage.<br><br>To my way of thinking, the most sensible course is 3). Having everything on your list where you can see it and vigorously weeding everything that's going nowhere is the way to tackle it. You'd probably want to feed stuff onto the list in stages rather than plonk the entire 500 down in one go of course.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 January 2018 at 19:19 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Will:<br><br>&lt;&lt; This is one of the recurring and key philosophical questions.

Why not skip the process of adding the task to the list? Instead, forward the email straightaway to your employer asking for reimbursement of the cost. Bcc yourself in and drop the email into a reminder folder so you can check in a few weeks if you have been paid. If not paid you can simply forward the email to them again chasing. Surely that course of action would be more efficient than an unnecessary step involving a list?<br><br>Regarding other comments, I would say level of work manageable, but copying it all onto lists is unmanageable. I have a lot of tasks that all need to be done at some point, but I feel in control and they do get done. I'm too busy to have pie in the sky tasks so they don't even enter any of my systems.<br><br>Interestingly my task list is actually less than 15 items, more like Marks recent "goal" list.<br>Consists of do post, do email, do posts its, do tele notes, do project x, etc.<br>I just cycle round that doing each category of task for a few hours. Very much like plate spinning.<br>Each category of task might contain a large number of sub tasks, but by actioning them all fairly regularly they are under control and there are no leaks at all.<br>Combine that with a zero procrastination attitude and it all seems to work, with negligible admin time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 January 2018 at 20:12 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>MrBacklog:<br><br>&lt;&lt; That brings up some more thoughts on what is the point of a list and do we actually need one? &gt;&gt;<br><br>No, obviously one doesn't need a list Billions of people around the world lead perfectly good lives without one. What's the point of one? To help you to lead a better life and/or do better work (however you define better) than you would without one.<br><br>As for the other points in your post, you seem to be answering a different question from the one your originally asked.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 January 2018 at 22:38 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Another way to reduce a list is to put things into categories.  If you decided to remove everything from that list which was like Clean _____, and just have Clean, your list would become smaller.  If you then had another list which had all those things to clean you could refer to it when you wanted to clean something.  This second list may be useful or not, depending on what that list is.  If it's not useful, just don't make it and stick to "Clean" as your task.  It's up to you when and whether to reduce things like this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 January 2018 at 23:35 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Another way to reduce a list is to put things into categories.&gt;&gt;<br><br>You may reduce the list that way, but you don't reduce the work.<br><br>In fact having "Clean" as a task is only effective if you have a standard cleaning sequence and know where you've got to on it. Otherwise you have to ask the question "Clean What?" and refer to the second list before you can make a decision. Since most people don't just get seized with the desire to clean in the abstract this can be problematic.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>5 January 2018 at 8:32 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>In terms of creating an incentive to reduce the amount of scanning, I'm finding that I treat my list like a game of Tetris. I'm doing it digitally but a highlighter could do the same thing on paper. <br><br>Basically I get to grey out all consecutive items that don't have anything uncompleted before them. <br><br>For example, if I have an item that is not done near the top of my list, and then 10 done tasks below it, I can't grey out those 10 done tasks (they just have a line through them) until I complete the 'blocking' task. Once I do that blocking task I can grey it out as well as well the consecrative completed tasks below it.<br><br>This a really nice way to keep the focus near the top of the list without being too restrictive. The nice thing about it is that the more completed tasks that come after an incomplete task (i.e the long the blocking task has been put off), the greater the reward will be when you complete the blocking task (because you get to grey out a huge block).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>5 January 2018 at 10:56 | Ben Vallack</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Yes, back to my first question: -<br>&lt;&lt;I was wondering if a catch all list is good for a certain limited number of tasks - maybe less than 200, but then becomes unmanageable when over that number?&gt;&gt;<br><br>I know for me a really long catch all list would not work particularly well as the tasks are too fast moving. It seems more efficient to action them directly from the source/format they first arrived in.<br><br>Hence I'm using a smaller list just to point me in the right direction at categories of tasks so they all get some time spent on them and none forgotten.<br><br>Maybe we are all different and long list work for some but not others. Perhaps something to consider? Maybe if the tasks are longer in the time to action them, then a list works. If there are 100's of quick tasks then tracking them on a list is not the right thing to do?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>5 January 2018 at 14:33 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>@ Brent &amp; Ben Vallack:<br><br>What you are doing with the highlighting is you introduce a mechanism to put pressure on some tasks.

Whenever you jump there, you clear it to zero.

But I have manged it on post and telecall notes. <br><br>I like DIT a lot! <br>Actually I think the recent real auto focus is the perfect system, as it makes you deal with the oldest items which is something I have let slip in the past.

I was using Mark's thoughts about attenuation.<br><br>&lt;&lt;Attenuation is almost the opposite effect to clumping. It is what happens to tasks on the list that don’t get done quickly. As other tasks around them get done so they get surrounded by deleted tasks. This has the effect of drawing attention to those undone tasks. The more the list gets attenuated the more the undone tasks stand out physically. This gives important information to your intuition. You can increase the contrast between tasks by joining contiguous deleted tasks by joining them together with a vertical line in the left margin. This gives you a very good picture at a glance of how many tasks remain on any given page&gt;&gt;<br><br>@Ben<br><br>I love the Tetris analogy.
