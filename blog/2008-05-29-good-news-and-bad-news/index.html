I recommend it to my organizing clients often, but they seem to find ordering it from the UK challenging.<br><br>Before you place the call to the publisher about How to Make Your Dreams Come True, be sure to check your publishing contract. At least here in the US, the issue of rights reversion is usually spelled out in the contract. It's my experience that the request has to be made in writing. Best of luck with that!<br><br>Janine</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 May 2008 at 20:22 | Janine Adams</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark,<br><br>I came across your blog awhile back and was intrigued by the title of your book: Do It Tomorrow. Being a collector of time management techniques, I couldn't help but buy it from Amazon.com. I also bought Forget the 7 Habits and Break All the Rules. This one caught my interest because I work for FranklinCovey and Stephen Covey is the author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.<br><br>I liked your ideas about time management. I've adapted  them for use with my Franklin Planner. I'll be blogging about your book in the near future and with your permission I will promote your ideas in my upcoming workshops through Project Management Northwest. Do you have any tips from your own workshops?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 May 2008 at 20:24 | Theresa Frasch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi, Janine<br><br>Thanks for the kind words about DIT. I have had a lot of enquiries from people in the States about how best to get hold of the book, so it's really good news from my point of view.<br><br>You are right about the contract. I can give written notice to the publishers to reprint, and if they don't signify their intention to do so within six weeks I can terminate the agreement - again in writing. But since they've already told me that they don't intend to reprint they may not require me to go through all that palaver!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 May 2008 at 22:24 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Dear Theresa<br><br>I'm delighted that you have found the ideas in DIT of use to you.

Having just reread it on holiday after a first read two years ago I'd forgotten just how good it is. I really enjoyed the way it is written and how it goes deeper as the book progresses. It is a very different book from your other two and one that I'd recommend to anyone. It's reminded me about Pull mode and spurrred me on to work on a cohesive narrative goal rather than my current list of discrete goals.<br><br>Looking forward to more and regular blog and article updates.<br>Regards,<br>Jonathan</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>3 June 2008 at 13:50 | Jonathan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark,<br><br>I'd echo Jonathan's words -- push for a reprint! *How to Make Your Dreams Come True* is in many ways my favourite of your books. I still remember reading it for the first time at university a couple of years ago, and my copy is now getting somewhat dog-eared...<br><br>Though, if you do publish it as an e-book, I'll certainly be pointing US friends towards it. :-)<br><br>Best,<br><br>Ali</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 June 2008 at 13:44 | Ali</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Jonathan and Ali, <br>Thanks for your kind remarks re "Dreams".
