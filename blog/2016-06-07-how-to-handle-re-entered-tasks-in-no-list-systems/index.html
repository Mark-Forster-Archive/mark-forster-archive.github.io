<p>My answers have at various times included the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have no re-entered tasks at all.</li>
<li>Re-enter a task only if there is current work still outstanding on it.</li>
<li>Re-enter a task if you expect it to be needed again the same day.</li>
<li>Re-enter all tasks regardless of whether they are going to be used again.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve chopped and changed systems to fit one or other of these, but none have proved entirely satisfactory. At one extreme, a lot of tasks are started but don’t get worked on to completion. At the other, there’s a long tail of re-entered tasks to plough through.</p>
<p>And what does one do about open-ended tasks like reading books? Reading a stated number of chapters or reading for a set time are too rigid for my liking.</p>
<p>How to handle these re-entered tasks is a really important question because, you will recall, my intention is not to do anything but to do <em>everything</em>!</p>
<p>I had a flash of light recently about this. If, I asked myself, a task can only get onto the list by being done, then perhaps it should only be able to get off the list by not being done.</p>
<p>So I’ve added the following rules to the <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/5/9/my-current-no-list-system.html">May 9 System</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever a task on the list has been worked on it must be re-entered, whether or not it is going to be needed again.</li>
<li>There is no compulsion to work on any re-entered task.</li>
<li>When you come to a re-entered task and for any reason do not work on it, that task is deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules involve a little bit more re-writing than before, but they seem to have solved the problem. The question of how long to keep a task on the list now boils down to the simple principle: “Work on a task and it’s on the list; don’t work on a task and it’s off the list”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I think I understand the rules, which are simple enough if you're using pen &amp; paper.  I'll probably need to do it that way before figuring out a clever way to run the system electronically.  <br><br>I like the idea of auto-reentry and resulting forced dismissal (deletion without further action).  It may seem negative simply to delete a bunch of (possibly unfinished) tasks at the end of the day. But remember that each deletion is a task on which at least some work was done!<br><br>Does it make sense to use a special mark or highlight for the deleted tasks?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 June 2016 at 19:52 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>While this "enforced dismissal" approach would work for tasks that can be worked on at any stage throughout the day, but what about tasks that need to be done regularly, multiple times a day, but not every time you cycle through the list?<br><br>To use a concrete example, I have a series of wrist exercises given to me by my physiotherapist that I'm supposed to do every 2-3 hours.  I could set an alarm to remind myself to do them, but I found that too intrusive and didn't work well for me at all.  Instead, I simply put "wrist" on my list at the start of the day, do my first set of exercises, and then re-enter that item for later.  Each time I cycle through the list and get to that item, I think "is it time for my wrist exercises?"  If so, I do them.  If not, I skip that item but keep it on the list.<br><br>I often do the same thing with my "email" task -- I like to check my email regularly throughout the day, but don't want to be doing it every time I cycle through the list.  So I'll often get to "email" and decide it's only been half an hour since I last checked it, so I'll skip it.<br><br>I must admit that I like the freedom of being able to choose whether to do a task or not whenever I get to it on the list.  Sometimes I'll get to a task and decide I've done enough on that for today, so I'll just delete it.  The rest of the time, I'll either do it or skip it, depending on what the task is and whether or not I think I should do it now.<br><br>Because of this, I find that your option #3 works the best for me: "Re-enter a task if you expect it to be needed again the same day."

Most of the tasks I did were one-off, and it seemed tedious to reenter them when I knew I would just be deleting them soon anyway.  It occurred to me that I could just enter any new task twice from the start, and 'dot' the first, rather than waiting until I had done some work on it.

It gives me an intentional placeholder so I can make a clean break. That seems to produce a "stopping, for now" feeling that I like. Because of the new list every day principle, I also know I will be back to it soon but refreshed. With this clean break, I'm able to move to the next task with no significant mental residue. <br><br>I've spontaneously developed my own method for dealing with re-entered tasks. If a re-entered task can't be worked on right now, then I can move on to the next re-entered guilt-free. If there are no more re-entered tasks that can be done, then I can add a new task and action it immediately. <br><br>I figured this out sitting in a long meeting where my input and attention weren't critical for about 15 minutes. I checked off "attend meeting", and then looked at my e-entered tasks. There were two, "empty paper inbox" and "design loyalty diagram", neither of which I could do sitting in the meeting. Wanting to follow the system, but not wanting to waste 15 free minutes, I thought of something I could do in my current context - "sketch ideas for camping gear". I did it, crossed it out, and then wrote another which I didn't finish. <br><br>When the meeting ended, I headed back to my desk, went to write another task, and realized that I could action the re-entered ones now, so I did. It felt simple - action re-entered tasks only if they can be done, otherwise skip them. IMPORTANT: this should not be a way for me to procrastinate on something I'm resisting. It's only for things that can't be actioned at the moment due to circumstances. <br><br>I think it's similar to what Michael B. said: "Note that I'm checking to see if the task is ready, not if I'm ready."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 June 2016 at 21:03 | Scott Moehring</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I rather like the record of what I did, in sequence.<br><br>I have gone back to electronic, though.

If entered digitally as plain text, an end-of-day postprocessor could reconstruct the daily log.  And if you prepend the columns, it would all line up without the need for added spaces (if using a fixed-width typeface).  The columns would be flipped left-right, and the current column is on the far left.<br><br>I'll try to replicate here with vee (v) for checkmark, dash (–) for blank space, and two dots (..) for the horizontal line:<br><br>v v v v v Email<br>v v v v v Paper<br>v v v v .. Tidy<br>•&nbsp;v v .. .. Evernote<br>- v .. .. .. Mow Lawn<br>- .. .. .. .. Check Diary<br><br>This lines up pretty well with the Georgia typeface; not sure about whatever default your browser is using.<br><br>This would also work fine with a square-gridded notebook, pad, or even index cards.  Just reserve the maximum number of repeat columns (10-15?) on the left or right edge.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 June 2016 at 14:35 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Will:<br><br>"Would you allow an open dot for the current task, filled in when you finish working on it?"<br><br>No, I've used that in the past and never found it to be a satisfying solution.

In looking through ubi’s example, I think that not stopping before the last task in the cycle may be what causes the divergence between DorD and DoubleEntry. <br><br>I myself am not having a problem (yet) keeping track of my place on the list (for the initial reason Michael B gave), but I’ll be interested to see what he is testing to keep better track.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>11 June 2016 at 15:10 | Dan H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Dan H<br><br>&lt;&lt;  I think that not stopping before the last task in the cycle may be what causes the divergence between DorD and DoubleEntry. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, that was my conclusion too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>12 June 2016 at 12:09 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>This approach to using Mark's May 9 System should produce the following benefits:<br><br>• It's easier to remember what your current task is than mine and Seraphim's previous approach<br><br>• It uses only a single dot to mark tasks as done<br><br>• Reduces the amount of rewrites while also allowing all tasks to remain on the list until undone per Mark's new May 9 System rules<br><br>Example:<br><br>You decide to write the report as your first task, so you write:<br><br>Write Report<br><br>You work on the report as long as you want, then stop and dot the task.

Instead of doing the tasks above the last dotted task bottom to top, do them top down until you reach the last dotted task. <br><br>2. When you reach the last dotted task, do it and rewrite it at the bottom of the list, or delete it. The list is now free of dotted tasks so you can add a new task. <br><br>In short:<br><br>Dotted task on the list? Complete a pass down the list from the top.<br><br>No more dotted tasks on the list? You can now add a new task and do it immediately, dotting it when you stop.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>12 June 2016 at 15:18 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Michael B.:<br><br>Thank you for this, and for such a worked through example.<br><br>While I was able to keep track of my place on the list with the earlier approach, it felt strange not to mark a task after working on it. So I prefer this new approach. (I also wonder if not marking a task after working on it is why it's possible to lose one's place.)<br><br>I also prefer working up the list rather than down the list, so I liked seeing that in the example. <br><br>Finally, I think I now know better what Mark meant, in his earlier comment, by the contradiction in the conditions you wanted. I take it that you weren't able to find an approach, consistent with your other conditions, that eliminated rewriting.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>13 June 2016 at 1:11 | Dan H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'm nearly finished testing and experimenting with all the current "No List" systems. One variation that's proven nice is to make a couple simple changes to the system Seraphim and I mentioned earlier in this thread, which is essentially a modified May 10th system with the June 7th rule additions:<br><br>Entry Phase<br>1. Write a new task down. Use no markings or dots. Your current task during Entry Phase is always the last task on the list.<br>2. Work on the task as long as you want. When done for now, leave the task in place.<br>3. Repeat from 1 until ready for a follow up.<br><br>Follow Up Phase<br>4. When ready for a follow up, draw a line at the end of the list.<br>5. Cycle back to the top of the list.<br>6. Go through each item from the beginning and either dot the task and work on it, or cross it out.<br>7. If you dot a task and work on it, cross it out and rewrite it at the end of the list.<br>8. When you reach the line at the end of the list return to the Entry Phase.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2016 at 10:40 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>The variation posted above should solve the problem of knowing where you are in the list at all times, while also limiting rewrites in a way that feels smooth and simple to use.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2016 at 11:17 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>One potential question is "How do I know when it's best to enter the follow up phase?"<br><br>Answers might include:<br><br>1. When you feel like it.<br>2. When the paper you're using for the list is full.<br>3. Every hour, or half hour.<br>4. When you hesitate as to what needs doing next.<br>5. When you glance at your list and see a previously written task that needs doing again.<br><br>For me, the best answers are 2, 4, and 5.
