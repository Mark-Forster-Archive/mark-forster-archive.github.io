Although it worked brilliantly and never let me down once, for some reason I’ve never come back to it.</p>
<p>The system in question is <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2008/8/3/predicting-your-day.html">Predicting Your Day</a>. You can read the instructions for yourself, plus the two follow-ups (which are clearly linked). But in summary, the idea is that at the beginning of the day you write down a list of what you predict that you will do that day. You then work for the rest of the day without reference to the list. The result the first time I tried it was astonishing, and it continued to work well for the whole time I used it.</p>
<p>Late yesterday afternoon I came across it while searching for something else and decided to have another crack at it. The results were just as astonishing as before. I put twenty-three tasks on the list, and had done all but two or three by mid-evening without once referring to the list. I then had a quick look at the list and finished the remaining tasks in no time at all without looking at the list again.</p>
<p>This morning I started first thing with 64 tasks on the list and at 08.45 I have already done 15 and am working on the 16th (this blog post).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most notable thing about this is the speed at which this all gets done. I find myself going from one task to another without any resistance or time spent deciding what to do.</p>
<p>Right, that’s done. It’s 08.52. What’s next?</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>There's clinical observation and research to suggest that less anxious people/families make better predictions (and respond with better accuracy) than higher anxious people. I'd imagine your exercise above - over time - could strengthen one's ability to accurately predict what one is capable for one day. Perhaps that spreads to improving one's ability to predict other areas, and thus lowering chronic anxiety** in the process.<br><br>** Chronic anxiety is primarily generated within relationships. Acute anxiety is fed by fear of what is; chronic anxiety is fed by fear of what might be. Worry, which is almost always about what might be, can be one clue to how much chronic anxiety a person is dealing with. <br><br>Taken from: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.anxiety.org/bowen-family-systems-theory-how-anxiety-spreads-affects-loved-ones">http://www.anxiety.org/bowen-family-systems-theory-how-anxiety-spreads-affects-loved-ones</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>5 October 2021 at 13:40 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I’m in!<br><br>Avrum, I read out of your post that this ought to work for low-anxiety people and fail for chronic anxiety types because they are bad at prediction, yet you think it would be helpful for the anxious.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>5 October 2021 at 17:46 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Alan.<br><br>&lt;&lt;work for low-anxiety people and fail for chronic anxiety types&gt;&gt;<br><br>I don't think in terms of fail or pass.

Perhaps this blog post proves you may not need one.

As a simple application, instead of making a list of housekeeping chores, you could just walk through the house and tackle anything that Stands Out.  Your house is an implicit List.<br><br>This concept can be extended to a virtual environment defined in your mind, which you walk through and address tasks you "see" at each station.  I don't know this would be better than a paper list, but this approach has the benefit that our minds are extremely good at remembering things stored in this fashion.  All the memory competition people use this sort of approach.<br><br>Back to the tangible world, you could imagine arranging your things such that tasks stand out or don't just by looking at the things.  Put a paper on a desk, or have a book pulled out a certain way to highlight something about it that needs doing.  Put a rake by the back door.  "If it's not away, it's a task."<br><br>p.s. day 2 of predicting my day.

Interesting ideas about extending it to puttering around the stations of my mind or around my office.

I'm either thinking of another play or possibly of the 1957 film version starring Kenneth More.<br><br>The only Barrie play anyone has ever heard of these days is "Peter Pan", though he wrote loads. I'm particularly fond of "The Little Minister" myself, which stared as a novel, then was dramatised as a play and many years later became a film. The play ran in America from 1897 for 300 consecutive performances, making Maude Adams into a star earning $500,000 a year.

I enjoyed the US trailer on YouTube. The film's American title is "Paradise Lagoon", and in the same spirit the trailer promises the film will show us how "a gentleman's gentleman, cast away on a desert island with four luscious dames, manages to keep them all happy!" - presumably by puttering or pottering from one to the next.<br><br>Chris</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>12 October 2021 at 9:09 | Chris Cooper</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>But also "learning to tolerate the discomfort of doing things imperfectly becomes a kind of self-improvement project in itself."  - <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/26/struggling-to-achieve-perfection-this-nautical-metaphor-might-help">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/26/struggling-to-achieve-perfection-this-nautical-metaphor-might-help</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>17 October 2021 at 16:13 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Puttering can be fun.

The first time around, AF came shortly after Mark introduced PYD, and the second time, PYD was an interlude between an extended AF trial, and the third time around, Mark had been extoling the virtues of AF1 to me in the forums a couple of weeks before. <br><br>Coincidence? Probably, maybe, perhaps?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>23 November 2021 at 2:53 | Aaron Hsu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
