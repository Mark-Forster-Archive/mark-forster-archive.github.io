<p>But as Disraeli famously said:<em> “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”</em></p>
<p>Does this study really prove something completely different: that ten years working as a civil servant in Whitehall is a very effective way of reducing whatever mental powers you had to start off with?</p>
<p>(I speak as someone who worked in Whitehall for only two years and has never been the same since!)</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark - Good take on how these studies work. However, I had an issue with your quote (which I use myself almost weekly). As an American, I wanted to give credit to Mark Twain, who popularized it here. Some cursory research showed me that he gave credit to Disraeli, but there are issues with that credit, also. Here's one explanation I found.<br><br>The earliest instance of the phrase found in print dates to a letter written June 8, 1891, published June 13, 1891, The National Observer p. 93(-94): NATIONAL PENSIONS [To the Editor of The National Observer] London, 8 June 1891 "Sir,--It has been wittily remarked that there are three kinds of falsehood: the first is a 'fib,' the second is a downright lie, and the third and most aggravated is statistics. It is on statistics and on the absence of statistics that the advocate of national pensions relies....." Later, in October 1891, as a query in Notes and Queries, the pseudonymous questioner, signing as "St Swithin", asked for the originator of the phrase, indicating common usage even at that date. The pseudonym has been attributed to Eliza Gutch.<br><br>Note that 1891 is after Disraeli died. Yet I will give you the possibility that he uttered it and it didn't show up in print until then.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>6 January 2012 at 12:33 | Terri</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Our brains peak in preschool years. Everyone know children think faster, learn faster, and make all kinds of mistakes because they don't yet understand, but also because several brain functions haven't matured yet. It takes 45 years for the brain to reach full maturity.<br><br>After that it's all downhill. If only I'd known Mark 25 years ago, he could have given me all kinds of brilliant insights on time management he only wishes he could provide now.  Except wait, that's completely false, because Mark today is surely more insightful than Mark 25 years ago in this respect.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>6 January 2012 at 14:00 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Terri:<br><br>&lt;&lt; However, I had an issue with your quote (which I use myself almost weekly). &gt;&gt;<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/814385?SSScrollPosition=7725">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/814385?SSScrollPosition=7725</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>6 January 2012 at 16:08 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I've noticed the nature of my thinking has changed over the years. I don't think I am as fast in some ways at raw, pure computation. But my ability to grasp big-picture ideas, synthesize, and learn more quickly has steadily increased as far as I can tell (I'm 47).<br><br>Right now I've just started taking up sight-singing, having never had any prior music exposure. The learning is difficult and requires a lot of work, but I'm getting it faster than people much younger than I, mainly because I put in the time and effort. I'm not sure how to interpret this. It's possible I'm slower than I was at 20, but that slowness is more than made up for by commitment and self-discipline.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>6 January 2012 at 16:28 | Stever Robbins</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Interesting reading in this respect: "The Secret Life of the Grown-Up Brain" by Barbara Strauch. To quote the back cover: "Did you know that your brain gets better with age? It used to be thought that, as our bodies aged, our minds did too. But now new research has revealed that between our forties and sixties our bains are actually in their peak condition". It's an interesting read, and also a comforting one (I'm 47).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>6 January 2012 at 19:21 | Marc (from Brussels)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Stever:<br><br>I think that the main problem I have found with age is with memory. It's not that I forget things so much as that I can't recall them as quickly as when I was younger. They are all in there somewhere - it's just a matter of getting them out again. On the other hand I do know a lot more than I did when I was young, so maybe there's more for the memory to search through!<br><br>But as for the other components of mental activity, I would say I'm at least as quick as when I was younger.<br><br>I wasn't joking when I said the study had in fact proved something quite different from what it though it had proved. If you put someone in a working environment which is rule-bound, discourages initiative, where unconformity is frowned on, which requires little imagination and doesn't (let's face it) have much contact with reality, then I think it does have a very deleterious effect on one's mind.<br><br>Congrats on the sight singing by the way. Singing is one subject which has consistently defeated me all my life!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>6 January 2012 at 19:59 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'm an avid chess player, and in that context it's abundantly clear that:<br>0. Children learn faster than older people, especially at ages 10-20.<br>1. Calculating variations is hard work, and the young (15-25) are able to to this faster and better.<br>2. Experience compensates, and the best 40 somethings are as good as the best 20 somethings.<br>3. After 50, energy levels, enthusiasm, and ability to concentrate for long periods wanes.<br>4. Understanding doesn't decline, though performance does.  Yet people who reach the top at 40 can still beat 99.9% of players 40 years later.<br>5. Bottom line: Until you've put your all into a thing, you can always do more and be more.  There are uncounted examples, and few counter-examples.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>6 January 2012 at 21:08 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark, the sight-singing has been extremely rewarding and equally frustrating. I'm seriously at the bottom of the learning curve. I haven't been this inept at anything since I was 20. It's skill-based, which means that no amount of intellectual understanding can help me get it any faster.<br><br>Here's what I do, however: I drill every day. It is very clear that daily drilling separated by sleep cycles very directly builds capability. There's a measurable difference every day in my skills. That's neat. It's frustrating only because there doesn't seem to be any shortcut; my results are highly correlated with the time I put in and the sleep in between.<br><br>When I notice a chronic problem in my practice, I design an exercise for that particular problem. For example, there are certain intervals I just can't remember. So I plunked out little made-up songs (with words and imagery) 30-seconds long on my keyboard that emphasized the troublesome intervals. Then I listen to them for 20 minutes each day until my brain starts to memorize them.<br><br>Learning to sing intervals is trickier because I have no outside source of feedback to know if I'm doing it right, which I often am not. For that, I go very slowly with a piano keyboard, and concentrate on listening to the external sound of the keyboard and of my voice, rather than my internal imagination of what the note *should* sound like. I'm gradually becoming able to sing most intervals.<br><br>(One intermediary skill in learning to sing intervals has been to explicitly develop comfort singing a note when it sounds dissonant. If a note is playing and I'm supposed to sing a major 7th above it, I have to hold that note even if it sounds a bit jarring to my ear. So paradoxically, I've had to develop the skill of singing a note even when my ear tells me it's out of tune. Because it's in tune, it's just a dissonant harmony.)<br><br>P.S.

Personally, my memory is very bad from the beginnig and hence I have never been able to rely on it for anything.  There are theories which insist that we hardly use 25% of our brain power anyway - and even that kind of heavy usage is for a very short time in a given day or week.<br><br>On a more philosophical note, we are bestowed with different capabilities at different points in our life.

And more I think that it is one of the major problems of our societies. <br><br>I am 49 and I will have 50 February 14th. I never felt so clear in my head. Yes memory is some time a problem. I don't remember all detail, but did I before ? I have a lot of projects and things to live if god let's me live a little more. I remember my gran father he launched 2 companies he was only 75 !. I am also in many human associations. I meet people they are about 60 to 85/90 sometimes. You could not imagine how green they are. They are just incredible. I remember my uncle he was 75 when he met a woman who was 35. They married and they made a baby. <br><br>The real question is about health. If you have it great. If you haven't it well that is a problem.<br><br>You have to be very strong in your head. <br><br>For my opinion, You have the age of yours thought. You can be 20 and think like a old man or woman. You can be 90 and think like a 20 years old man or woman. <br><br>Still you have hope and dreams you stay alive. Still you struggle for life and live with hope and desire you are alive. Oldness becomes when you are not anymore interested by people or actuality. <br><br>I think what of the most important lesson I ever understood is what I leant with my English vicare. I was ten to 20. He lived at holmer vicarage at hereford. He was about 60 to over. He was very interested by people. For was I perceived he tried not to see the half empty bottle. But instead the Half full bottle. <br><br>Life is a tresor. People is a tresor too. Still you try to progress and love, still you try to care about yours positive thought and thow away bad thoughts, still you try to live and share with other then still you stay alive and young. But if you do not you die. Spiritualy or physically. <br><br>It is just as simple as that.<br><br>So no. As my gran father said, life begins at 45. You are more experienced. You are better and you understand yours mistakes. In fact at 40 and over your are at the beginning of your real life.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>13 January 2012 at 12:26 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Well said, Jupiter!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>13 January 2012 at 15:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>You had an English vicar in Hereford?

After that it becomes impossible to keep up with where your brute brain power once was. In addition there are individual differences as to starting points. Starting with an IQ of 155 and then experiencing waning capability is different from someone with less IQ. Finally there's the EQ to take into consideration.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 January 2012 at 11:11 | Gadgetgy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Gadgetgy:<br><br>I remain unconvinced by a lot of the research on this subject.  My own opinion (not based on any research) is that a lot of the slowing of the brain in later life is due to the way the brain works - that over a period of 50 or 60 years it has laid down very strong pathways which tend to be followed all the time, increasingly involuntarily.<br><br> Growth in the brain occurs when new stuff is undertaken, and this is less likely when one is literally "in a rut". I notice in myself even at the age of 68 that when I am dealing with new stuff and actively engaging with it, my thinking suddenly becomes as clear as it was when I was 40 or 50 years younger. In fact in those circumstances I quite often forget that I'm _not_ 40 or 50 years younger and find myself talking to people very much younger than myself as an equal in age.
