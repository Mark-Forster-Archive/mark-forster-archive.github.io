We usually start off with the best of intentions, keep going for a week or two and then miss a day. Then it’s a shorter period until we miss another day and that turns into two days, and before we know it we have given up the goal altogether. All we have achieved is to make ourselves feel guilty!<br></p><p>How can you motivate yourself to do better than this?<br></p><p>There is a simple method called “Chaining” which can greatly increase your chances of success. It takes the form of competing against yourself to produce the longest chain of days in which you succeeded with your goal.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if your goal is to practise the piano daily you manage to carry this out for two weeks and then miss a day. You have made a chain of fourteen days. Now your aim is to beat your record of fourteen days.<br></p><p>The great advantage of chaining is that it recognises that we are almost certain to fail sometimes, but this a positive as it allows us to compete with ourselves to get better and better.</p><p>So why not give it a try? Select one goal (positive or negative) which you would like to establish in your life and see how long a chain you can make. There’s even a website to help you do this:</p><a href="http://www.joesgoals.com">www.joesgoals.com</a><br><br><p>Get your first goal well established before taking on another. Having too many goals going at once will dilute the effect.</p><p>Let me know how you get on!<br></p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I love chaining and find it very helpful in creating new habits.

Maybe it's because we spent our summer vacations playing-- really playing-- instead of working on a farm like our forebears.  <br><br>our predecessors were much better than we are at working hard for the sake of working hard and not wondering why it isn't more fun.  Maybe they just made it fun, I don't know.  Are we spoiled compared to them?  Maybe.  But if they needed games, they had simpler omes, I think.

Of course if your choice is "work or starve" that does concentrate the mind wonderfully!<br><br>But I think our ancestors often had equivalent methods of making it easier to keep going.

Remember the final scene of "Seven Samurai" where the peasants are singing while they work in the field, and the surviving samurai realise that life goes on and that they are now just spectators.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>13 August 2008 at 0:49 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark, I've recently been  reading around establishing and breaking habits and one view is that people tend to keep doing what they focus on. So, if I have a negative goal of 'not drinking coffee', for example, this may be counter-productive because it may draw attention to 'coffee' and possibly re-enforce it. What are your view on this in relation to the Chaining concept?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>11 December 2008 at 8:28 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Leon:<br><br>Yes, I've heard this theory before, and I wonder if it's just someone's speculation or whether there is any research to support it. Personally I'd love to know how one is supposed to not focus on the subject when one is giving up highly addictive substances like caffeine and nicotine. My experience of doing both is that my every thought was directed there whether I liked it or not!<br><br>P.S. I succeeded in giving up smoking - I haven't smoked since 1973 - but caffeine defeated me, though I drink tea rather than coffee these days.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>11 December 2008 at 11:42 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark, I read about this in a NLP based text, although there was no direct reference to any scientific research. I guess it is very difficult to *not* focus on the bad habit one is trying to give up as withdrawal symptoms surface. I suppose from a practical point of view less harmful / more positive behaviours may be substituted (tea for coffee!). <br><br>Maybe it is neccessary to think deeply and close in on on a 'bad' habit if one is to have any chance of dealing with it... I do think the Chaining method is a good, visual, feedback tool for tracking one's progress though.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>11 December 2008 at 13:46 | Leon</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
