Some people find this quite a difficult concept, and others can’t understand it at all.</p>
<p>“Standing out” is what happens when your conscious mind instructs your unconscious mind to identify tasks/items that fit certain criteria.</p>
<p>So for instance if you were given a list of well-known places and asked to tick which ones you would really like to visit, there are two ways you could do it:</p>
<p>1. You could draw up a list of factors, assign a weight to each, grade them with the weighted score, and then tick the places with a score above a pre-determined minimum</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>2. You could scan through the list ticking the places that stand out as places you’d really like to visit.</p>
<p>My contention is that as well as being much quicker, you are more likely to end up somewhere you really enjoy visiting if you use Method 2.</p>
<p>Of course, method 2 won’t work if you don’t already know at least something about the places in question.</p>
<p>But when we’re talking about tasks on your to-do list, you <em>do</em> know something about the tasks. In fact you&nbsp;are the world’s greatest expert about your life and how it all fits together. You can trust your unconscious mind to come up with better answers than your conscious mind, just as it it did in the places to visit example.</p>
<p>But only if you give it the right instructions.</p>
<p>What are the right instructions?</p>
<p>Tell your unconscious mind to make tasks stand out that you <em>want </em><em>to do now</em>. Very important - don’t attempt to tell it what you mean by “want” - that’s something the unconscious mind can identify much better than your conscious mind can.</p>
<p>For the DDD list the instructions are a bit diifferent - <em>want to do now </em>&nbsp;changes to:</p>
<p>DELETE: <em>don’t want to do at all</em></p>
<p>DEFER: <em>don’t want to do now</em></p>
<p>DO of course doesn’t need an instruction because it’s everything left over from DELETE AND DEFER.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark, interested to test this and hear from other readers if this concept really works in practice.<br>I know I'm quite rubbish at picking the right tasks to do if I'm left to my own devices.<br>A few tasks seem to get deferred now and again when I know they really shouldn't...<br>I will give it a go...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 July 2017 at 20:43 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>MrBacklog:<br><br>It's like almost any human action.

Or think of landmarks. Yes, this chair and book are great right now, but at the end of vacation, will I regret not getting the canoe out?

What am I resisting because of fear? Because of laziness?<br><br>Thinking as a mother, which tasks are important? Thinking as a mother to my son? Mother to my daughter? Primary housekeeper? Wife?

I am very, very often correct when I give back of the envelope or off the cuff estimates in meetings. These estimates are always accompanied by a series of qualifying statements but when I go back to my desk and work it through I am usually pretty close to my ballpark. Maybe this is confirmation bias? Or maybe I've been doing it long enough, and trust my gut enough, to hit a pretty close number based on the factors I am aware of.<br><br>I think the list scan is exactly that. A way to pick out the nails sticking up so you can hammer them down. They say a finger can discern an irregularity too small for the eye to see. You'll often see a woodworker run their hand along a finished edge and then go back and clean it up a little in one spot or another. That is what is going on when you scan a list. This is why the capture habit is so important.<br><br>Combining this with your "feeling good" experiment can be tricky. If you have too many responsibilities it can be hard to know which finished surface you should run your hand along to find an imperfection.
