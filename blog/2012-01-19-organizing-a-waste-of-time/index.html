In the real world, I've spent plenty of time (sadly) using that random-papers-all-over-the-place system, and no, it's not better than organizing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>20 January 2012 at 0:46 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I agree that search is better than file folders when search is good and files/documents contain the right keywords to be keyword searchable. But when things are misnamed, search doesn't work so well.<br><br>The author seems rather thrilled, however, that our technology is letting us drop even a modicum of thinking ahead and instead turning everything into a last-minute scramble. It's hard for me to imagine this being a better life at a personal level, much less being healthy for a society that is confronting serious global trends that will require careful, long-term coordination to fix.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>20 January 2012 at 2:26 | Stever Robbins</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>At some point I agree with him.

If it's anything otherwise, then this paragraph is entirely wrong, in my opinion:<br><br>&lt;&lt;I think that email is much overused as a tool. Most of the things that it is used for are useless. In companies, it is most used for tracing endless discussions about how to do, what to do, who is going to do what, ...

Not deleting it is free.  Searching email for where an idea arose is easy and fast.  Email is very quick, and it doesn't intrude on another person's work process.  If I need to know something this afternoon, I can ask a question this morning, get a response in an hour, ignore it for two hours, and then use it, all with no downtime.  Face to face meetings are useful when the matter at hand gets complicated, as nothing complicated can be resolved at the leisurely pace of email conversations.  But voice-recording and elaborate minute taking? Ick!  Going all-paper and organizing everything that way?  Triple ick!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>20 January 2012 at 14:17 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Organization can serve other uses than "make easy to find in future".<br><br>Tidying notes can help you review them. (This is different than blindly recopying and hoping things will sink in.)<br><br>Putting everything together can help you see if you're missing something.<br><br>It can keep your brain organized. All the notes for a project are in one place.<br><br>It can be closure, as the project is shelved (permanently or temporarily while you work on something else).<br><br>Remember the card catalogue in libraries? I used to maintain the school's.

Select all my email.<br>2. Click "Send to OneNote"<br>3. Archive<br><br>I then process in OneNote following AF1-like rules.   Each email itself becomes an item in my AF1 list, essentially.  <br><br>If I ever need to find the original email, it's easy to find it in Outlook with the search function.<br><br>Gmail is a little harder.  I have to select the text I want, and then click "Send to OneNote".  I can't do all the emails in one batch.  (Anyone know of a Firefox plugin that can do this for me???)  :-)<br><br>With paper, I essentially do the same thing.   I dump all my incoming paper on my desk, and go through it quickly.   If I can't deal with the paper immediately, I scan it into OneNote, and file it all into one big accordion file for the year.   Even the junk mail, if I am undecided what to do about it.   <br><br>With this approach, all my paper is in the same OneNote AF1-like system.   If I need to refer to the original paper, it's pretty easy to find in that accordion file.  Usually I don't have to look too far back.<br><br>Thus, the scan of the item itself becomes a task in my AF1 list.<br><br>The small amount of overhead to scan the paper is nothing compared to (1) trying to set up and manage a more complex filing system and (2) writing down the item in OneNote.   <br><br>I used to worry I'd have all this extra paper (e.g., undecided junkmails) in my folder.  Who cares?   At the end of the year, it just goes into a box.  I have room for lots of boxes.   Once the boxes are old enough to discard they go in the shredder.   <br><br>The savings in mental energy is well worth the cost of finding space for the box.<br><br>The only exceptions to this filing system are essential records that are expensive or impossible to replace, such as official educational records,  birth records, legal documents, etc.   And a good deal of those are in a single accordion file labeled "important", which I keep in my fireproof cabinet.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>21 January 2012 at 0:55 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Seraphim,<br><br>I'm intrigued. I move everything to a "processing" folder, go through that moving anything requiring action to tasks and then move what remains to archive. Do you find you get a better task list in OneNote than the Outlook Task list?<br><br>(I do use OneNote for planning, brainstorming and minuting, though. It is a frustration to me that you can't easily create a note from a task. But I find the task functions in outlook compelling. )</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>24 January 2012 at 22:34 | will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Seraphim follows my page per task scheme in OneNote. OneNote is simply the easiest freeform note taking tool ever. It's also great at grouping and moving around stuff, which is more than enough for AutoFocus. Add in excellent searching.<br><br>Given that, what does Outlook tasks offer to compete?  Most task management functionality is irrelevant to AutoFocus.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 January 2012 at 3:23 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>will - <br><br>When I was doing DWM, I implemented it using Outlook Tasks.  I created a button with a macro that would turn any new email into a task with a due date of Today + 30 days.  I created another button that would reset the due date on any task to Today + 7.    It worked pretty well -- I used that system for 6 or 9 months, maybe longer, I don't remember.<br><br>But the task model is very limited.  OneNote allows me to group related tasks together (with sections, subpages, etc.).  It's free-form enough to allow brainstorming, note-taking, project planning, etc., and have all of that integrated into the TM system.   And you can pull content into OneNote from anywhere -- from a browser, or any standard Office app, or screen shots, etc.  <br><br>For example:  I get some weird error message on my screen.  I want to report it to IT.   Easy:  take a screen shot with the Windows-S key.  The screen shot itself instantly becomes a new task in my list.  :-)<br><br>Can't do that with Outlook tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 January 2012 at 16:39 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Can't do that with Outlook tasks.&gt;&gt;<br><br>All the things you mention for OneNote can also be done with Evernote.
