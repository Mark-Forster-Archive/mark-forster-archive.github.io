By this I meant that I wanted to find a method that would free our minds to naturally focus on what was important to us and leave the rest.</p>
<p>This never quite worked out with Autofocus or its successors. Recently I been spending quite a bit of time trying to work out what I was doing wrong.</p>
<p>Here are some of the conclusions I’ve come to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We should consciously interfere with this natural selection process as little as possible.</li>
<li>We need to rid ourselves of all ideas that we “should” be doing this, that or the other task.</li>
<li>If we don’t get round to doing a task, that’s a sign that we should let it die.</li>
<li>A prerequisite for natural selection is a large seed-bed of possibilities. This would imply that we should use a “catch-all” list and add every fleeting idea to it.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We should rid ourselves of the idea that putting a task on the list implies any commitment to doing it. It does however imply a commitment to keeping it under consideration for as long as it remains on the list.</li>
<li>There is no such thing as procrastination. What we call “procrastination” is just our minds working through the selection process.</li>
<li>A method of weeding out tasks which are showing no sign of getting done is required. This implies no condemnation - it is purely housekeeping to keep the list manageable.</li>
<li>Our method of working the list should put no pressure on us to do any particular task or tasks.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you compare the above list with Autofocus you can see exactly why Autofocus ultimately failed to provide a long-term satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>The solution is not to make Autofocus more complicated or effective. It is to radically simplify it and remove even the faintest suspicion of compulsion from every part of it.</p>
<p><em>Current Method</em></p>
<p>What I have been working with over the last few days is a “Catch-all” list to which I add everything that I think of. I scan it continuously as one list from one end to the other, taking action on tasks that stand out and re-entering recurring and unfinished tasks.</p>
<p>At the end of the day (or beginning of the next) I remove pages on which there has been no movement during the day. This purely a housekeeping matter to keep the list manageable. It’s not a penalty or “dismissal”.</p>
<p>This is proving extremely effective. I’m getting a vast amount of work done without any of the usual heartache (or brainache) about what I should be doing.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>As you will realise if you’ve been around my website for a bit, there’s nothing new about any part of this. In fact the difference is not so much in the method as in the mental attitude that goes with it. It’s a matter of learning to trust that your subconscious mind is quite capable of sorting through your tangled priorities without any interference from your conscious mind. In fact it does a much better job on its own.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I was using No-List Autofocus recently to re-familiarize myself with its immediate doing of tasks in order to get them on the list, and the various ways that were published on how to dismiss pages that hadn't been worked on during the day—counting up the tasks on the page; using dashes or slashes; or adding the date when a page is filled. <br><br>Perhaps if one prefers a bound notebook they might use a dismissal method similar to one of the above and simply delete the unactioned pages with a big "X", then skip over them during subsequent scans.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 February 2017 at 5:46 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Michael B:<br><br>When I wrote "remove pages" I actually meant cross them out rather than physically remove them - though the latter is feasible if you are using a ring-binder and only one side of the paper.<br><br>I simply add up the number of live tasks left on each page at the end of the day and record it at the top of the page.

One question. My first reaction on reading the instruction about removing pages when no action taken on the tasks on the page during that day was "oh no I can't remove up to 30 tasks". I accept its probably a lot less than that but did you find that the fact that you were removing that page that evening if no tasks were worked on, made you work on at least one to keep the page in the system?  Not saying this is a bad thing, it makes me work on tasks in Autofocus that I was resisting to stop me dismissing the whole page.<br><br>I appreciate using terms like make/resisting/dismissal are not how to think about this system but just how I think about the AF systems which I use the most.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 February 2017 at 11:52 | skeg</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark<br><br>Do you review the "removed" pages or just let the tasks return naturally to the active list?<br><br>And do you still add tasks and projects at any level?<br><br>E.g. <br><br>Sharpen pencil<br>Project X<br>Kettle on<br>Annual Report</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 February 2017 at 12:04 | Caibre65</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>skeg:<br><br>&lt;&lt; did you find that the fact that you were removing that page that evening if no tasks were worked on, made you work on at least one to keep the page in the system? &gt;&gt;<br><br>I have to confess that I haven't yet had to remove a page under this rule. However in accordance with the principle "Our method of working the list should put no pressure on us to do any particular task or tasks", that would be undesirable. I think if I felt a task was still "valid", I would cross it out and re-enter it immediately at the end of the list. But remember that the rule exists in order to keep the list relevant, so that you don't have to plough through tons of stuff that doesn't stand a hope of getting done in the foreseeable future.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 February 2017 at 16:39 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Caibre65:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Do you review the "removed" pages or just let the tasks return naturally to the active list? &gt;&gt;<br><br>The idea is to get rid of tasks off the list that aren't being actioned, not to encourage them to be actioned.

When beginning to scan this list, I find that each and every item on page 1 stand out for me, and I work with great focus and motivation all day with these tasks, never going further, since I really want/need to do them all and don't have time to do more than the first page of tasks that day. If I never get around to even start thinking about scanning page 2-10, it seems to me strange to just cross them out, especially if this way of working is supposed to be free and natural. Might there be another way to express the rule of dismissal? Or is there a point in being forced to move on to the next pages, so that you don't have to get rid of a page that you know contains vital actions or thoughts? But forcing oneself to move on through the pages feels less "free" to me. Ideally, I should be able to stay on one page, or even one task/thought all day if I feel like it, without the system forcing me to do anything radical.
