It’s not intended to be a static post, but one which I shall keep adding to (newest on top).</p>
<p><em>Being up-to-date</em></p>
<p>What does it mean to finish a task in the sense of having no work outstanding as stated in the rules? It doesn’t mean “finished for good”. Basically the sense is that you are up-to-date with the work on the project. You can be up-to-date with a project long before it is finished for good. If you have a project which you expect to take three months, then you are up-to-date as long as you are on track with the schedules and deadlines relating to that project.</p>
<p>So a very important part of running the “Spinning Plates” is being clear what you mean by being “up-to-date”. You may need to have a different definition of this for each project. Sometimes these are set for you, but more often you will need to define them yourself.</p>
<p>If you have a project to read “War &amp; Peace” you might have a goal of so many pages or chapters a day - or you might simply be happy to read “something” every day without defining how long that is. It’s up to you.</p>
<p>For Housework, you might have daily chores, weekly chores (each on a different day of the week) and monthly chores. As long as you are on schedule with these, you are up-to-date.</p>
<p><em>Electronic Implementation</em></p>
<p>For electronic implementation, there is no need to have more  than the one active column. The columns across the page in the written  version look pretty and provide a historical record, but they are not  strictly necessary. All you need to know is whether at the end of a pass  there are any arrows or crosses in the column. And of course you can  use any symbols you like (or colour coding) in place of the ticks,  arrows and crosses.</p>
<p><em>Minor Tasks</em></p>
<p>It is a good idea fairly early on to add a task called “Minor Tasks” to your list. You can then keep a separate sublist of small necessary tasks which don’t fit into any of the existing projects on the main list. However this must not become a place where you add everything you haven’t yet succeeded in putting on the main list. Remember that like every other task the “Minor Tasks” task must be completely cleared before you can add any more tasks to the main list.</p>
<p>You are therefore advised to use the following rules with respect to the “Minor Tasks” sublist:</p>
<p>1) Don’t add any tasks which are too big to be done in one go.</p>
<p>2) Don’t add more tasks than you can do in one go.</p>
<p>3) Make the “Minor Tasks” sublist a closed list, i.e. no new tasks can be added to it once it has been started until all the tasks on it have been done. I also recommend you do the tasks in the same order they are written.</p>
<p><em>Size of Tasks</em></p>
<p>I’ve tended to refer in the instructions to “task” and “project” more or less interchangeably. This is quite deliberate because the system simply treats a project as a big task. Whether a particular entry is a big task or a small task is up to you.</p>
<p>It’s sometimes a good idea to combine small tasks into larger tasks as you go along. So for instance if you have a project to sort out your office, you might start with a task “Sort Desk”. Once the desk is sorted, that is retitled “Tidy Desk”, and you start another task “Sort Pamphlet Racks”. That again becomes “Tidy Pamphlet Racks”. After you’ve done this with a few more office-sorting jobs, you can combine them all into one task “Tidy Office”.</p>
<p>Remember that although you can combine existing tasks, you can only include tasks in the combination which are already on the list.</p>
<p>The best time to do this sort of editing, combining and retitling work is when you are rewriting the page because you have filled all the available columns.</p>

There are many variations on how you could vary the time blocks in your book. <br><br>I have been a huge fan in the past of AF1, AF4 and Random and have loved the high turnover of completed tasks and how good that feels. What has always eventually tripped me up has been items that are needed to complete but whatever the system is that I am using has not thrown it up for action/completion (and keeping lots of deadlines in my diary does not work as that is a separate system and I want everything in one). So I always end up going back to the rotation method. <br><br>This new system appears to complicate that simple approach and I am struggling to see what benefits you gain from this approach. I can fully understand the visual approach of having a list with a series of ticks but I have that too by listing the subjects above and ticking them off one by one after each 20 minute period (or 10 minutes per subject if that is all that available time allows that particular day). Hopefully you can see that I am a big fan of your systems and open minded to try new ones so not being critical but keen to hear what benefits this latest system has over your earlier approach</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>16 April 2014 at 13:06 | skeg</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>skeg:<br><br>You're right in that the "spinning plates" is very similar to the system in "Get Everything Done". In fact I often used to use the analogy of spinning plates when running seminars on the system.<br><br>As far as the visual approach is concerned, that is purely a result of the way the method is done on paper. I've already said that it's unnecessary in an electronic version. GED looks even more complicated on paper because as well as the ticks you also have to write in the length of the time-burst.<br><br>The limit of ten on the number of subjects was "until you are well-established in the system". After that you are allowed to increase the number.<br><br>The main differences between the new system and the old are:<br><br>1) The new system doesn't use time-boxing (though there's nothing to stop anyone using it if they want to).<br><br>2) The new system uses a more gradual approach to building the list in which grouping of tasks occurs naturally as part of working the system.<br><br>If you find the previous system works fine for you then stick to it. There's no reason at all why you have to move over to the new system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>16 April 2014 at 16:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Another great post!

So, when the environment starts pushing something that I have not given attention - or pro-action to - I naturally feel like the issue presented is just another distraction; something from Stephen Covey's "LOW importance, HIGH urgency quadrant".
