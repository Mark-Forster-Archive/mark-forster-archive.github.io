<p>First I’ve removed the author’s description and photo. This is part of a move on my part to reduce the “cult of personality”. Of course I’m not going to succeed entirely on a site named “markforster.net”, but it reflects the increasingly small part that time management (as a subject for study) plays in my life now.</p>
<p>Secondly I’ve removed the subscription box for the newsletter. My plans for the newsletter never came to fruition (I just got interested in too many other things), yet it costs me quite a considerable sum of money to maintain a subscription list of this size. If I don’t stop new subscribers I shall soon be into the next price bracket.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 80%;">* This is actually a good example of rationalization after the event. The truth is that I deleted both by accident (by clicking on “Remove” instead of “Disable”) and can’t be bothered to go through the hassle of reinstating them - besides, I rather like it this way. </span></p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Removing the cult of personality is a great move. I do appreciate all of the work you've been willing to share during all these years. Any of the systems you produced have either born fruit in my life, or not, and I know which ones do and which ones don't, for trying all of them. This website still contains lots of useful information. Thank you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 March 2013 at 11:11 | Laurent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Thanks for relenting Mark.

I am not sure what happened overall with you yesterday, but you have many, many friends here that are quite worried about your "FV only" discussion mandate yesterday.  And I am perplexed by your "SMEMA is only for me and not recommended to others".

There is a wealth of valuable information here, and it would be a shame to lose it.<br><br>As far as the photo goes, I thought it made the site more interesting, though I liked the photo of you at the computer better.<br><br>As for the newsletter, that doesn't seem to be much of a loss, but can you repost the two emails from the archive as articles or blog posts, so that the FV instructions are available for anyone interested in using it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 March 2013 at 15:38 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Deven, there's a link to the FV instructions / newsletter archives on the home page</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 March 2013 at 15:53 | Lillian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Ah, so there is.

Even our names themselves are not something we invent out of "cultish" or marketing reasons, but they are given to us by our parents and by our society.  Usually we have no say in that!<br><br>When the forerunners of the world wide web matured enough, system administrators would use the civil names of the users, reduce them to a string short enough for the computers of that time to handle and create so-called home directories for each one.<br><br>Later files in these directories would become the "homepages" of "netizens".  So you got a lot of URLs like ://edu.time-mgmt.everything-online.gov/focus/src/focus/~mforster/.<br><br>There are many websites online, that derive their name from such ~tildeplusname directories. Example: zeldman.com used to be blahlhlh/kjkj/~zeldman in the olden days.<br><br>So, naming your site after your name is just the traditional concept of a homepage and perfectly fine geek culture and not cultish at all.  It is a very egalitarian concept I think.  You know, <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://America/~democracy">http://America/~democracy</a> and so on.<br><br>Having your name on your house is just the generic, modest, identifier.  It is nice in the way that it is agnostic in it's formulation in regards to the content behind it.  So changing the emphasize of the content never breaks the concept of the name. <br><br>I anything, the slogan "get everything done" is resembling those "cult heros" who market their seminars etc pp, because it is a promise and formulated in a catchy way.  But I do not think that promise is unwarranted, it is the experience of many people who gave Mark's materials a serious try.  It is also an apt pointer to what to expect from this site.<br><br>It is also subtly funny, specially when one is acquainted with some of the other brandings in the time management arena.  I still giggle from time to time like a Ford Prefect, when I think of how "do it tomorrow" turns into "did" it already, somewhat.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 March 2013 at 5:05 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark,<br><br>Try Google's Feedburner service to deliver email updates to your subscribers for free feedburner.com. <br><br>Cheers,<br>Corl</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 March 2013 at 0:22 | Corl</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
