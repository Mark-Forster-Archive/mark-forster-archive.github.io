We are right on schedule for that date.</p>
<p>My own testing of the system has continued to go unbelievably well, and has even survived being used over the Christmas season. With most time management systems I get to the stage of having to force myself to continue using it. This has not been the case at all with this new system. Quite the reverse - I actually have to tear myself away from it. Which is pretty sad, I have to admit!</p>
<p>The other thing that I frequently find with time management systems is that I start to get frustrated because I am not doing as much as I want to. Again this has not been the case with the new system. It has adjusted perfectly to whatever has been going on at the time, and I’ve always been happy that it has enabled me to do whatever is really important <strong>to me</strong>. I emphasize “to me” because so many goal setting systems imprison us in what we think <strong>ought</strong> to be important to us.</p>
<p>So, a complete absence of procrastination, a sense of being on top of everything that matters to me, and a renewed vision of where I want to go and what I want to do - is that enough to make me feel this is the most important discovery I have ever made?</p>

I've always enjoyed researching time management and self development programs and have found your systems to be the most workable that I've found, I think because you so obviously work to ensure that your systems are constantly reviewed, adapted and added to. <br><br>I have to confess to a high degree of curiosity about the removal of procrastination - regardless of what system I use procrastination has a habit of creeping up on me.  The fact that a large part of my time is dictated by outside influences gives procrastination a lot of freedom to take over!  Of course it is never my fault!!<br><br>Looking forward to the launch party ........ :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>30 December 2008 at 23:32 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi, Christine<br><br>Yes, the complete lack of procrastination is one of the most remarkable features of this system. I've never worked a system before in which it didn't gradually creep up on me as you describe. I'll be interested to see whether other people find the same.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>30 December 2008 at 23:38 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark<br><br>Can the new system work equally well for those of us who are predominantly computer and PDA oriented?   Or is a paper based system the preferred method to use? Looking forward to the big launch. I have been a constant reader of your work and have been empowered many times.

It's an excellent method that that's similar to how I work my hybrid version of DIT and GTD.  At the least, it's an excellent reference! His system can accomodate many different people's needs, ambitions, responsibilities, etc.  It makes my planning, goal setting, reviews and prioritizing much easier. Plus, it's quite flexible.  It's hard to make it not work!  LOL! (Since I can't use a computer at will (disabled), I've retrofitted many aspects into a paper system.<br>His website is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.michaellinenberger.com">http://www.michaellinenberger.com</a><br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 January 2009 at 1:07 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Like many others, I have found DIT the best of all the many systems I have tried.  I echo what gsd smlies (correct?) says about Michael Linenberger and I use his TWC method as a way of using Outlook 2007 (preferably) for using DIT.  After implementing TWC last year I emailed Michael to say there is a lot in common with DIT; Michael replied that he was surprised not to have heard of it, but had ordered a copy.  I expect to see some of DIT included in a future TWC or update.<br><br>As I also use OneNote 2007 (not as efficiently as i would like, the desire for perfectionism keeps getting in the way, one of the perceived reasons for my own procrastination), I am very keen to see if Autofocus can be done effectively with OneNote 2007, as some have hinted already in comments above.<br><br>You Americans have the snow to use as backlog recovery time, it seems.  I will be on assignment in Africa for five weeks next month, so hope to use weekends to test AFTM and clean up my OneNote files, IF the electricity supply is working.<br><br>Roll on 5 January beta testing, one productive way to spend the 10 hour flight to South Africa next week.  I'd like fellow OneNote users to highlight how they are using the software to manage AFTM.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 January 2009 at 17:44 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I hesitated to sign up because, as I'm retired, I have way too much discretion about how I use my time. I've recently discovered "Refuse to Choose" by Barbara Sher which has helped me understand that I do not have and will probably never have a single, clear focus around which to organize everything I do. Rather, I have many overlapping interests--and time spent on any one always seems like time lost on others. So I'm very intrigued to see if Autofocus can help me focus. Getting Things Done helped a bit, but then became an obsession all by itself. DIT was a breath of fresh air and works well when I'm overwhelmed by externally generated demands that must be met soon (like doing taxes). At other times, I find my lists are just places to park things I really do intend to do, need to do, want to do, while I go about either dabbling in one of my pet projects or another or killing time reading too much fluff on the internet. <br><br>One trouble with creative projects is that when you get up a head of steam, it's very hard to stop working in time to get to the other things originally planned for the day--one hates to lose the momentum/inspiration/energy/excitement. It's joyful for the duration, but then when you do stop you realize you've let some things slide that you didn't want to let slide.... Can't wait to see the new system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 January 2009 at 18:25 | Stan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Roger<br><br>I can relate to your comment re perfectionism being a major factor in procrastination - I definitely believe that to be an issue for me - but find OneNote to be a great tool to deal with that aspect.  It took me a while to use it effectively (and I am still experimenting) but I have found the key for me to be, not just in the planning, but also in the fact that OneNote's flexibility enables me to redefine layouts etc as I feed more into it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>3 January 2009 at 0:57 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Stan:<br><br>Autofocus uses only one list and my recommendation will be that you bung everything into it, including your pet projects, your taxes and your internet surfing and let the system sort it all out for you.
