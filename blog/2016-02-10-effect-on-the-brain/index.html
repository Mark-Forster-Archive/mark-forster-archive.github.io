<p><strong><em>Seraphim asked:</em></strong></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>“Could you elaborate on this a bit more?   I am intrigued.”</em></p>
<p>What is the effect of feeding each day’s sheet through a shredder?</p>
<p>First of all, it brings about a sense of completion. The next day starts with a clean sheet with nothing left over from the day before. Whatever work you were engaged in has to be re-created.</p>
<p>Your mind is not however re-creating the work from scratch. During each day paths in the brain are either strengthened, amended or abandoned. This means that one’s work is always alive, relevant and creative.</p>
<p>This is a contrast to working off an old list, where creativity consists only in writing down yet more tasks on the list without actually taking action on them.</p>
<p>Let’s compare the thinking and action that goes with “catch all” and “no list” methods, which are the two extremes of continuing and one-day lists.</p>
<p><em>Catch all</em></p>
<p>The simplest type of catch-all system is where you just have an open list of tasks and circulate through it, doing the tasks that feel ready to do. At the beginning of each day what you are presented with is usually a long list which has been built up over a period of time, a matter of days, weeks or in some cases even months. At some stage you thought of a task and wrote it on the list. It may get done quickly, but a large number of these tasks will hang around on the list for days.</p>
<p>What your mind therefore has to do is to choose between anything up to 100 or more tasks - all of which you thought were a good idea at some stage in the past. You can only do one of these tasks at a time and very likely while you are doing that task even more are being added.</p>
<p>Your main motivation is to get rid of the tasks on the list. This of course can never actually be done so you always end the day with much the same number of tasks as you began it - frequently more.&nbsp; Because you have such a large number of tasks to choose from your focus is poor and it’s difficult to build up good routines.</p>
<p><em>No-list</em></p>
<p>The simplest form of no-list system is just to write down the next thing you are going to do before you do it. The act of writing down the next action forces you to make a conscious decision about what to do, rather than just drift into something.</p>
<p>Your mind has no list to rely on, so what sort of tasks is it going to choose? It will probably come up with one of the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>The next task in an established routine</li>
<li>Something that is on your mind because you are currently working on it</li>
<li>A project you have previously decided will be your main focus for the day</li>
<li>An urgent project or task</li>
<li>Something which is causing you concern because it is overdue or in danger of becoming so</li>
<li>Something you make a conscious decision to do because you want to do it</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that all these things relate to what matters at the moment. Your concern is with what you are actually involved in. At the end of the day you will have filled the day with stuff that is actually relevant and is within your capabilities to do in the time available.</p>
<p>Your brain therefore will be concentrated on the immediate reality of what is in your life, rather than diffused over a vast sea of possibilies, most of which will never happen.</p>

I think personality type is also relevant.  I find knowing I have written something down I have committed to do for someone relieves stress.  If I had to work thinking about whether or not I will remember these commitments it would be draining on me and reduce productivity.  Maybe I need to build up this skill.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 February 2016 at 17:01 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Gerry:<br><br>&lt;&lt;  I find knowing I have written something down I have committed to do for someone relieves stress. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Strangely enough my experience is that using a no-list method I am *more* reliable at delivering things I have committed to do for someone. This is probably because instead of writing them down for an indefinite future date, I now just get on with them. The result is that I don't have to remember them at all. As I've said several times in other threads, "no-list" methods are not exercises in memory.<br><br>If it's something I've committed to do on a *definite* future date, then I would put it in my calendar, where of course it would get done as soon as that date was reached.<br><br>So my question is why do you need to write down your commitment to someone else - why don't you just do it? If you write down these commitments you will accumulate more and more of them, precisely because you don't do them immediately and instead put them off to the future..</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 February 2016 at 18:18 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark,<br><br>Great idea about the use of the calendar, it seems like integrating a calendar into time management is an idea some embrace while other resist, but for many things it makes lots of sense.<br><br>&lt;&lt;So my question is why do you need to write down your commitment to someone else - why don't you just do it? If you write down these commitments you will accumulate more and more of them, precisely because you don't do them immediately and instead put them off to the future.. &gt;&gt;<br><br>The answer to this is that many times the items are almost mini projects that take hours or days to complete.  I agree if the item is quick and simple it is best to just get it done immediately.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 February 2016 at 19:28 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>My work context is that I have multiple demands coming into me from multiple people, nearly all the time, and there is no way I can do them all immediately. My role also involves being available at any time  for an emergency type context, which can occur several times in a day. <br><br>I need processes that hold where I am at while I deal with the emergency task and ensure I am keeping track of what is most important and/or possible to do. <br><br>My experience is that if I don't write down what's coming in I do forget.  So I use an aspect of the Do It Tomorrow process.  I have a two days to a page planner.  One side of it I use to capture all the incoming tasks, ideas, requests, etc.  if it's something to be done today I put it on a daily list on the other page, which also has a schedule.  If it's really urgent I mark it in some way.  <br><br>Then through the day on a big sticky note I have a very short SMEMA type list which I pull out of my head.  I review that regularly through the day to ensure I am working on what is important In the context of all that is going in.  When I have spaces, I go back to my daily list and yesterday's capture list to see what can be scheduled in my planner or digital calendar,  or put on context lists that I have in another notebook.  I travel and move around a lot and paper often works best for me. <br><br>I find that writing things down keeps my head clear for managing what is in front of me.  I regularly have to decide what is possible for me to do, what won't get done and what can be delegated. <br><br>I often don't refer to my lists and use memory and I usually start afresh about once a month.  But I do find having my lists/ memory joggers there helps me focus on the present moment knowing the rest is held.  They are also what help me relax at night, rather than churning it all in my head. <br><br>Always ready to get a new perspective and try something new.  So really interested in the detail of the new process you are finding is working so well, to see if it fits for me.  Any idea of timelines as to when we might hear about it? <br><br>Also wondering where your thinking is with FVP, which I understood you developed after writing Secrets of Productive People.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 February 2016 at 21:19 | Sarah Jane</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Thanks for this, Mark.  I am still intrigued, but wary, for the same reasons as those who already commented.<br><br>Here's a practical question ...  Practical for my kids, anyway!  :-)   (I've been introducing the older ones to your systems.)<br><br>How would you handle something like a list of college reading and homework assignments, in a system like this?   For example, several long reading assignments, one or two essay projects, a collaborative engineering project, several problem sets, and preparation for pending examinations.  All the assignments have deadlines, some this week, some next week, maybe one in a month or so.   Then throw in a handful of optional reading assignments just to make it interesting, and also preparations for a coming student club meeting, and scholarship application forms coming due.   <br><br>Thanks!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>11 February 2016 at 4:54 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>&gt;&gt; Why? What is it about commitments made to others that would cause you to forget about them?<br><br>I cannot speak for Paul B, it's not that there is something different about commitments to others or even any other sort of list that causes me to forget, just that up to a certain point, my mind, and some others, only remembers so much. also, earlier I had a similar question and gave a list of things to do for a project. which made it look like I COULD easily remember all steps of that project. rather, it was all made up as typical type of steps. might have several projects going at once and not at all remember all steps, so useful to have them on a list.<br><br>I think what I have difficulty understanding, is where the no list is put to use if all lists that are needed are on project or calendar or other places, then what is the no list that we are talking about? is it the list that is used to decide what is the next thing to do, including what I just think of and DO remember and also what I need to go to list to look up?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>11 February 2016 at 5:37 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark, I get your overall direction you want to go to, but I think there may be practical issues a person can run into, especially if you are managing a couple of people or groups.<br><br>Let me give an example of a typical day for me:<br>- Meeting at 10 with an employee. He asks me for a raise<br>- At 11 another meeting with operations where they ask for additional small spend in the warehouse. (Not very a big cost in the grander scheme of things, but important for them)<br><br>I am lucky and have no meetings in the afternoon and can sit and work on my tasks.<br><br>I remember (luckily), that an employee has asked me for a raise.  I start thinking about this.  I start looking at the expenses for the year and think it may work, but I need to check in with HR as well.  I need to set up a meeting with her...but somebody comes into my office with a personal crisis.<br><br>An hour later, I get back to the employee thing and set up a calendar invite with HR for the next day.  OK, this medium sized task is on track and I have a meeting to remind me of it tomorrow.<br><br>BUT, I am almost sure I would have forgotten that in my second meeting I promised to look at extra spend for operations if I did not write this down on a catch all list.<br><br>Yes, operations will remind me if I did not get back to them in the near future, but I hate that.

So long as the catch all list is a reference and not used to drive action. At some point, you worry that you may have forgotten something and your next task is to focus on checking the list. Then, having checked the list, you go back to the no-list approach and decide what to do next.<br><br>Amongst other things, this allows you to use your catch all as a buffer against the constant stream of urgent tasks which will disrupt your "next task" decisions unless they are safely tucked away.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>11 February 2016 at 10:35 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Seraphim,<br><br>&lt;&lt; How would you handle something like a list of college reading and homework assignments, in a system like this?   For example, several long reading assignments, one or two essay projects, a collaborative engineering project, several problem sets, and preparation for pending examinations.  All the assignments have deadlines, some this week, some next week, maybe one in a month or so.   Then throw in a handful of optional reading assignments just to make it interesting, and also preparations for a coming student club meeting, and scholarship application forms coming due.  &gt;&gt;<br><br>How much of this would you put on a to-do list anyway? You're not going to list all the reading assignments on the to-do list, are you? You'd refer to the assignment lists, etc, and probably diarise a schedule of start and finish dates for them. That would be exactly the same with a "catch-all" system and a "no-list" system.<br><br>Basically the to-do list tasks you describe here are:<br><br>Read book<br>Write essay<br>Work on project<br>Do problems<br>Prepare for exams<br>Prepare club meeting<br>Complete scholarship application forms<br><br>Those are all pretty standard student routine actions.

You're not going to list all the reading assignments on the to-do list, are you? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Actually, personally, that *is* what I would do.   All the things I mentioned would comprise maybe 20-30 individual items on an FVP list (for example).   If I am using a catch-all approach, I like putting this level of detail in the one list, indicating the deadline, so I can see all my workload and commitments in one place.   It can be very effective -- even though it does have all the drawbacks you have been describing.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; You'd refer to the assignment lists, etc, and probably diarise a schedule of start and finish dates for them. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Actually, I wouldn't do it that way.   I have *tried* doing it that way, but for me, it tends to make the overall workload invisible and un-engaging.   Specific tasks get my attention and draw me in much more effectively.   For example, "Read Engineering Ch 3 - due Friday" and "Engineering Exam on Tuesday - get ready" get my attention and draw me in a lot more effectively than  "Engineering homework".<br><br>&lt;&lt; What advantage does a catch-all system have here? &gt;&gt;<br><br>I'm not arguing that a catch-all system has any advantages here.  I agree with your overall assessment -- catch-all lists do have the weaknesses you describe.   <br><br>I was really just trying to get a better understanding the no-list approach, and how you envision keeping track of details and not dropping things in a typical student's life, using a no-list approach.   <br><br>You've made it clear that you didn't intend that people would just rely on memory for these kinds of things.   So in the end, I think you are saying, one should develop systems as needed to support the specific needs of one's work.   Keep details in project files, or in a school-assignment tracker, or whatever works.   Keep asking questions and building systems till you find what works.   And avoid a central catch-all as your central model, because it tends to make your work go stale and become overwhelming, leading to a focus on trivia (and everything else you wrote in the original post.)<br><br>When I've tried to do this in the past, I always ended up developing some kind of catch-all anyway.   Things would pile up in my Outlook Tasks, or in my email inbox, or in my calendar, or in stickies on my wall, or a combination of all these.   <br><br>So, to arrive at my own system for handling my tendency to create catch-all lists that get stale and overwhelming, I can follow the questioning approach in your new book (ch. 5 and elsewhere).   I can ask myself "Why do I keep building up these catch-all lists in so many different forms?"    There are lots of reasons.  I don't want to forget important deadlines / commitments.  I don't want to forget brainstorms and ideas.   I am easily excited by new ideas and don't want to lose them (but in retrospect many seem stale or silly later).   Hmm, that's all I can think of right now.<br><br>So then, following the guidance in Ch. 5, I can ask myself the same question tomorrow (without looking at today's answers); then repeat it again for another day or two.   Then look back and see what patterns I find.   Then see if I can develop a system to address the real needs that I uncover.   Perhaps even develop an experiment to see if the new system actually addresses the need (ch. 39).    Etc.<br><br>In my students' world, we could ask, "Why do I keep staying up late to finish my homework?"  (or whatever).   And then start asking "how" questions, and ultimately follow this process to arrive at an effective system to stay on top of my homework.<br><br>Is that the kind of thing you are driving at here?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>11 February 2016 at 20:17 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark, you say that the things you need to remember needs to be written down.<br><br>Pratically, where must I write this down?
