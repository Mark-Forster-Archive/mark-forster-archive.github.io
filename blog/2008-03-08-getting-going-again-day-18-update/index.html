Today I am&nbsp;conscious that I am beginning&nbsp;to slip behind badly. Now this is the point at which a lot of people start saying things like: <em>“I’ve got too much to do to use DIT at the moment. I’ll get back into it when I’ve caught up with my work.”</em></p><p>What they should be saying of course is: <em>“I’ve got too much to do NOT to be using DIT at the moment. I’ll get back into it straight away and then I’ll easily catch up with my work.”</em></p><p><strong>2) How easy it is to get right again</strong></p><p>To get back on top of my work I need to do three things:</p><ol><li><div>Admit that I have got behind and declare a backlog. </div></li><li><div>Draw&nbsp;up&nbsp;my normal&nbsp;Will Do list for Monday and put “Clear Backlog” as the Current Initiative.</div></li><li><div>Get moving on the Will Do list on Monday.</div></li></ol><p>That’s it!

My criteria is if I'm holding true to both my personal aims and my obligations to others, then I won't sweat a bit of fluctuation in my productivity flow.  I don't see where that philosophy can't suit non-disabled people as well!.....From what I can deduce from your entries, you're WELL AHEAD with the *top down* stuff.....the bottom up stuff is always quick and easy to get back on track with.LOL!<br><br>Nope,....I'm not going to buy into your overly harsh self evaluation!

The "failure" related to my experiment with the 7-30-7 system - and it was the system that failed not me!<br><br>The current posting is about how to get back on track when one has fallen behind a bit. Rather than struggle to catch up, declare a backlog and then you are immediately back on top of things.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>8 March 2008 at 17:47 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark<br>yet, again......oops!  I apologize!  LOL!

When can you start to trust the system?<br><br>Is it as simple as monitoring your task ageing or some sort of Days' Tasks Outstanding statistic for a couple of weeks to check that you have your commitments, available time and efficiency balanced?<br><br>I find that declaring (or admitting) a backlog delivers an instant hit of energy and confidence, but I'm not so good at disentangling the overcommitments, inefficiencies and overscheduling that will lead me to the same place in a couple of weeks.<br><br>Can you lead us through your analysis of: <br>- how you determine that it's not right<br>- what led you to this state and <br>- how you have addressed the underlying issues?<br>(obviously disguising any details which are, frankly, none of my business).<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Will</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 March 2008 at 9:17 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Dear Will<br><br>I'm sorry to have disturbed you. I obviously didn't describe what happened clearly enough.<br><br>The DIT system worked perfectly. The reason I fell behind was that I tried an experiment early in the week with a different system that didn't work out (that's the drawback of being me - I'm always experimenting with new systems rather than sticking with what I know works - but then that's how I developed DIT in the first place).<br><br>Because I wasn't in the office much during the rest of the week, I wasn't able to catch up with the backlog caused by the failure of the experiment.However in this situation it is in fact very easy to get back on track as I describe.<br><br>The audit procedure wasn't necessary as I already knew what was wrong. (Or if you prefer, you can say the audit procedure showed that the reason for getting behind was the failed experiment).<br><br>My analysis is:<br><br>1) If you can't catch up with your Will Do list for 3 or 4 days running then you should carry out the audit procedure.<br><br>2) You shouldn't continue to struggle to catch up once you have fallen seriously behind but instead should declare a backlog.<br><br>1) and 2) must always go together.<br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 March 2008 at 12:23 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark<br><br>Maybe we're quibbling about semantics!  LOL!  When you stated to Will above:<br><br>"2) You shouldn't continue to struggle to catch up once you have fallen seriously behind but instead should declare a backlog."<br><br>the words "seriously behind" sets off a loud and frightening alarm similar to the "bomb/airaide alarms of World War II" and flags waving desperately.  My vision here is a Navy Signal Man on the deck of a flight carrier furiously waving his flags to guide in a drunken fighter pilot!

If the plane is a little bit off course, the pilot can correct and still make a safe landing. If it is seriously off course, then he needs to abort the landing and come round again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 March 2008 at 15:09 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark<br>LOL!
