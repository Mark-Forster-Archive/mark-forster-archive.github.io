Accordingly I spent a bit of time developing a variation on FVP called <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/12/21/fast-fvp.html">Fast FVP</a>. Those readers who have tried it out have generally speaking found it works well.</p>
<p>However in the post I also said that <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/">Autofocus (AF1)</a> was systematic and fast but not flexible. So I’ve now been looking at how I can produce Flexible Autofocus. I’ve been trying this out over the last few days and actually prefer it to Fast FVP.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>1. It uses exactly the same rules as AF1 except for the following.</p>
<p>2. When you finish scanning a page, you no longer proceed automatically to the next page and repeat the page scanning procedure. Instead, you scan forward ignoring the page structure until you come to a task that stands out as ready to be done. You may skip over several pages before this happens.</p>
<p>3. Once you have done the task that stood out, you are “trapped” on its page. You have to carry out the full page scanning procedure on that page in order to be released from it. Once you have been released, you repeat rule 2.</p>
<p>4. AF1’s dismissal rules obviously wouldn’t work with this. I don’t see much point in trying to work out a different form of dismissal, so there is no dismissal in this method.</p>
<p>I’m so far very satisfied with how this works. We’ll see how well it stands up in the long term. But there is one challenge yet to come:</p>

I guessed the key mechanism behind its effectiveness was giving just enough extra focus and depth when you need it. I guessed related tasks would tend to cluster on the same pages, so it's exactly the right place to add some focusing power. In fact, I would guess this might make AutoFocus even more focused, in addition to being more flexible.

A forum conversation led to me to take another look at the GED book, and what I see in Chapter Seven (the rotating timeboxes) sure looks like a systematic no-list to me.

In effect it is a "Lots of Lists" system. For instance in the example given in Chapter 7 (page 95 in the print edition) the categories are:<br><br>Email<br>Letters<br>Phone<br>Filing<br>Accounts<br>Client Follow Up<br>Prospecting<br>Publicity<br>New Premises<br><br>Each of those will have either a checklist or an in-box (in some cases both). I was quite clear in specifying this. "For each project you will be working off a checklist".<br><br>How would you adapt this to working as a "No List" system?<br><br>P.S. <br>It's interesting to see how communications have moved on in the eighteen years since the book was written. Email is no longer my primary method of communication. I've sent one letter so far this year (with much grumbling at the inconvenience) and only seem to receive them from doctors.

If a category has one clear priority, then it is the goal for that timebox. In no-list fashion, you can make one of those temporary throw-away lists (I forget what you called them) for any category. When a category needs a new goal, you can select from its no-list list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>23 February 2017 at 19:07 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Bernie:<br><br>OK....

I don't throw away any of my lists, so I doubt mine qualifies as a no-list system. No-list was never great for me anyway, but I imagine those who like no-list could make good use of GED's framework to keep hammering on projects in a tight loop.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>24 February 2017 at 2:51 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark<br><br>I came across this version of AF recently.<br><br>I'm slightly confused by the second instruction:<br><br>"2. When you finish scanning a page, you no longer proceed automatically to the next page and repeat the page scanning procedure. Instead, you scan forward ignoring the page structure until you come to a task that stands out as ready to be done. You may skip over several pages before this happens."<br><br>As per AF1 instructions should this read "you no longer proceed automatically to the top of the same page to repeat the page scanning procedure"?  Essentially it seems this version of AF does away with the quick first scan and the slower second scan and instead you just scan down the whole list ignoring the page structure until you come across a task you want to do?<br><br>Aside from this and the fact there is no dismissal procedure, there are no other differences with AF1 that I can see?  So is the intention therefore that any urgent tasks are more readily available to be selected?  Having tried this out I'm not sure whether this improves this problem which was encountered in AF1 (hence the development of SF) as you could be stuck in page-lock mode which is not really any different from AF1?<br><br>Also can you or perhaps nuntym explain why the dismissal rules won't work here as it seems so similar to AF1 that I'm struggling to find any differences!<br><br>I read in another post that you were working on another system recently - I would be interested if there have been any developments there.
