No need to add me to the list, but just wanted to put it out there that I'm going to do Getting Things Done for Lenten.  I've been totally surprised over the past several months that GTD has been working relatively well for me compared to simple scanning.  This is based less on how much I get done, but more on the emotions that I experience with SS verses GTD.  For some reason, I get really stressed when I'm around my family when I use SS.  GTD kind of gives me the benefits of a long list combined with the flexibility of a no list (i.e. do whatever you feel like doing whenever).  Sometimes I use different elements of certain algorithms to help out (like simple scanning in one context—say internet actions), or reviewing the whole list and "dotting" items that I'd like to get to today, but then doing them in whatever order I'd like.  <br><br>I realize GTD isn't the most popular system among this forum, but I'm going to give it a try.  Seems to have worked the best for me the past while.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 March 2022 at 19:00 | Cameron</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>A tweet I posted today, taking a small jab at Tiago Forte (Building A Second Brain),  and mentioning the Lenten Challenge <br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/chris_r_cooper/status/1501528869987303428?s=20&amp;t=uHz0yBmXgGsFdRjbs-A5vQ">http://twitter.com/chris_r_cooper/status/1501528869987303428?s=20&amp;t=uHz0yBmXgGsFdRjbs-A5vQ</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 March 2022 at 14:26 | Chris Cooper</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'm out, going back to a combination of random and 5t.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>15 March 2022 at 12:46 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Superfocus worked so well for me when I was in school, so reading through all of <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1421758">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1421758</a> evoked a lot of memories and wanting to try it again.

Unfortunately, I caught Covid (flu-like symptoms for the better part of two weeks, mainly bedridden) followed by two weeks of going to bed as soon as possible after work with exhaustion. I had started using "Dreams", refreshed my journaling, to-do lists, and commenced Self-coaching - but it fell apart during the illness. I am recovered now; indeed I have just completed an excellent self-coaching session! But the momentum of a daily commitment is lost. Best wishes to everyone else and I will check in on other people's Lenten experiences. Next year I hope to be back!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>30 March 2022 at 10:17 | Brandon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I was thinking of sticking to the end, but I realised I really hadn't been using the weighted randomiser regularly over this period, so I'm out (as of 6 April). <br><br>Ultimately the randomiser gave me a feeling of working on too many things too slowly. And "difficult" things were often presented to me when I was in no mood (or low energy etc.) to do them, in which case I generally did a negligible amount of work or simply ignored the selection. I guess manually choosing what to do still works best for me. I do like my easily sorted spreadsheet of tasks, so I'll be keeping that around. <br><br>I'm currently trying out NQ-FVP, since Mark Forster's been talking about it recently.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>8 April 2022 at 16:22 | Virix</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>For the last week, I got my list out about twice... so, failed now.

I am happy to report I am faithfully executing my LAPS every day.  However LAPS is not what I started the Lent with.  The initial system (GAS mark II) was not fully gelled and I found it necessary to reboot midway through March.  <br><br>LAPS’ aim, progressing what matters, is the same as my Goal Achievment Sytem (and Mark II), but it’s much lighter.  It’s design is layered, with an extremely simple core makes it easy to stick to. The layers on top can always be changed up, but I haven’t needed to; they seem just right. I’ll explain over time in the forums.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 April 2022 at 13:21 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'm still using Teux Deux to hold my daily task list and finding it very helpful since I'm mostly digital these days. As it's web based, I can use it at work; as there's an iOS app (but very basic) I can add stuff via my phone or iPad.<br><br>At the end of each day, I map out the 10 or so tasks I want to accomplish the next day. I've also taken to adding in my appointments at the top of the day's list; so when I look ahead 2 weeks in my calendar, I'll port over significant appointments/birthdays, etc. Helps me reinforce what's coming up. <br><br>Depending on the day, I'll rearrange the tasks in the list so they're in an approximate order of execution, taking into account meetings, project work, etc. Or, for a new task, I'll put it on tomorrow's task list (DIT!) or in one of Carl Pullein's Time Sectors divisions, which exist as persistent lists at the bottom of the screen: This Week, Next Week, This Month, Next Month, Long-term. On the weekend, I will pull tasks from when I think they need doing into the daily lists; Long-term is basically the longlist. <br><br>Anyway, I'm rather surprised I stuck with Txdx so consistently. Ease of entry, ease of marking something done, ease of moving the tasks around, editing, linking with URLs, etc. all helped with making me remaining consistent. Also, having a workflow for the tasks so I don't have to make so many decisions in the moment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 April 2022 at 14:43 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I am a huge DIT fan, so this was not a difficult challenge for me.  Throw in some SS, some GTD, some decluttering of physical space. That latter is important, send a birthday card can be actioned in 30s or 1hr 40 depending on your underlying level of physical organisation ! I don't differentiate between work and non work, it all needs doing, so its all valid and important even if having a card box and stamps (1st/2nd/Euro and air mail stickers) in the same place (**ALL THE TIME**) sounds trivial to some. <br><br>I still have my backlog which feels overwhelming to me at times, and is a result of poor systems/no systems in earlier life.  Still there are only 2 large-ish boxes and a small box on top, surely 10/15 mins a day will chip away at it.   Its not like those houses we see on reality TV where people cant even walk into a room.. I put a bunny on the top of it today to make it seem less overwhelming! smiley face<br><br>So I cannot contemplate changing my system, in fact, I cling to it.  I rule my diary now, and its not the other way round.  Maybe next year I will feel embedded enough in DIT to try something new, but right now the thought of pages and pages of A4 scoring and un-scoring and dotting and what not would fry my brain, but I am delighted if its working for you.  <br><br>I am setting my own "Non Lenten Challenge" - I hope to get rid of the 3 boxes which weigh so heavily on my mind, check in next March '23 for an update ! <br><br>Then maybe next Lenten challenge I will change to a new system. But not till then.<br><br>thanks Mark</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>16 April 2022 at 12:33 | Mrs Move Forward</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
