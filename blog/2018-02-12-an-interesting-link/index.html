A good sense of achievement.<br><br>Also, if there are lots of tasks then I think the system is better suited to electronic rather than paper.

It seems a lot of what he writes is very similar to what has been discussed here about organizing projects.  While one approach is what Mark Forster did in dumping Welsh stuff onto his FFVP list, another approach is to build up a list outside of the main list with just those items, and the main list would reference that other list.  Now Pivot Lists takes it a step further and suggests to move EVERYTHING out to other lists, and then just pick a list to work on for a period.  This seems likely to work.<br><br>I have an intermediate idea in mind.  I want to run with some of what's suggested and pull out things into separate lists, yet keep the "unorganized list" as a master list.  In my case would still include things not pulled out into a separate list, and call out to each of these other lists, and would be processed typically, by simple scanning or FFVP or whatever.<br><br>Lists I intend to pull out: Shopping (groceries, etc.), meal planning (see my forum post; see also the Pivot List document on Workflows), work separated from home, and certain aspects of work separated one from another.

This keeps them fresh and alive and relevant, while also keeping them simple and no-overhead. If you set up a bunch of standing lists, you now have a bunch of things you need to maintain and fuss over. It's possible this could still be low overhead, but many of us here have a tendency to over-think and over-organize. Standing side lists can become pets that need to be groomed and fed.<br><br>I got the sense that Daniel's system is closer to Mark's dynamic lists -- everything goes first into the main list, then you spawn off the pivot lists when the need arises, dynamically, without premeditation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>23 February 2018 at 15:41 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I suppose that’s a question for Daniel. Certainly they start organically. And he describes a process intended to clear out small lists as you work them. But what happens to those lists when they contain things that are never fully done?  My impression is those lists become standing lists that are always around. I could be wrong on this this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>23 February 2018 at 22:04 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Okay, what I proposed above doesn't work.
