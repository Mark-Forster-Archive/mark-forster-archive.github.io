It’s taken longer than I expected, largely because of the number of possible options I had to test out, or rather the number of possible combinations of options. As I can only test out one set of options at a time, this has all taken time.</p>
<p>What I want to do now is to prove that this new system is not a way of churning trivialities but of being extremely productive. So I intend to report regularly on my progress over the next month. I’m going on holiday abroad on November 14th, so let’s see how much I can achieve by then.</p>
<p>What would I like to have achieved?</p>
<p>1. I want to make some serious progress on writing my book about the new methods, planning how to distribute it, spread the word about it and make some money out of it. This will include making decisions about my newsletter and implementing them.</p>
<p>2. I am planning a major charity walk to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the start of WW1 in 1914. This will involve me in a) getting extremely fit (not easy at my age!) b) improving my French c) getting practical support d) getting sponsorship e) and probably a lot else I haven’t thought of yet. This is obviously a long-term project, but I need to keep moving on it now.</p>
<p>3. I am likely to be leading a major fund raising exercise over the next year. It hasn’t yet been given the go-ahead, but I need to be able to react quickly to any developments.</p>
<p>4. I have commitments to various organizations which I want to carry out efficiently, and some of them are likely to expand in the near future.</p>
<p>5. I am testing out various brain training methods to see what is most effective. This requires a constant effort over a long period.</p>
<p>6. I want to get all my systems and procedures as finely-honed as possible so I am not held up by things not working properly. I intend to draw up a list of everything in my life that needs attention and tackle them progressively over time.</p>
<p>7. And just generally keep right on top of email, phone, paper, household chores, etc, etc.</p>
<p>I think that’s enough to be going on with!</p>
<p>My aim is to report once a week until I go on holiday, and possibly when I get back as well.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Bravo, Sir!<br><br>Will be watching your progress with a keen eye.

I have a bunch of time management background, and am writing a potential book on the subject, and I think your idea is fascinating.<br><br>I am not quite clear on unfinished items (col 1) rolling into crucial (col 2), and where they are in comparison to real crucial items in col 2. Also, and I am sure you know this,a calendar must be addressed in this system, for date certain items, or followups. for example, how do you handle something you don't care about until two weeks or so - I don't imagine you want to keep it in a far back ago page, but you also don't want to transfer it daily.<br><br>Can't wait for your Final-Final as I'll be the first in line.<br><br>Take care,<br><br>Dart</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 November 2011 at 18:37 | dart</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Dart, welcome.  Your comment is about SuperFocus, not the unpublished Final Version.  <br><br>In Superfocus the idea is most stuff you re-enter on the last page, same as AF1, but urgent stuff, and things you are presently working on but have set aside for a moment go in Column 2.  There's no distinction between these.  Current wisdom suggests both these uses be kept to an absolute minimum.<br><br>We agree a calendar is needed for dated items.  If something doesn't need consideration for two weeks, put it on the calendar.  When the day arrives, (if it's not critical for that date) it's entered into SF, and the item will be tackled in the next couple days.  So there would not be any "transfer it daily".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 November 2011 at 16:38 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
