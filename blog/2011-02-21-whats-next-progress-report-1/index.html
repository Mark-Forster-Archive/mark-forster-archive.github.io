List”, and use it as an example of how to work projects with SuperFocus, how have I got on with the task so far?</p>
<p>The answer is nothing.</p>
<p>I’ve passed the page with this task on it twice today, and both times it failed to stand out for me.</p>
<p>Sorry about that, guys.</p>

This is a weirdly wonderful progress report. I say this because I believe that doing something out of choice/desire produces much better results in less time than forcing yourself when it's not the right time. Though, in many work situations, we do not really have control over waiting until the time is right and often have to plod ahead anyway. However, SF provides a much more comfortable platform from which to work. Thanks for your continued work on these very helpful systems.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>21 February 2011 at 23:19 | Maureen</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Not a problem, Mark.

I'm tending to either dump the list or just some readyish items into SF, or at least pick one and say "ebook outline -&gt; WNL" if ebook was the thing chosen. Then when outline is drafted I return to Wnl and pick another item, and/or write ebook back on the main list or the WNL. <br><br>"what's next list" and other big vague things just get ignored in SF more than previous systems.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 February 2011 at 12:41 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>&lt;&lt; "what's next list" and other big vague things just get ignored in SF more than previous systems. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Not if they're in Column 2 they don't.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 February 2011 at 13:00 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Isn't that "illegal"?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 February 2011 at 13:04 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark:<br><br>I've been following your progress on the newest version of SF.

How could a column 2 task not move?  I guess that was a red herring.<br><br>To your question: No, it isn't what you said most recently.  Given my above confusion, it didn't help.  I think I have it straight again: If it's in column 2, it must be worked on; when you mentioned column 2, that wasn't connected to a project you didn't work on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 February 2011 at 17:15 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Point: Vague-sounding tasks don't move much. Therefore it's not surprising to me your project didn't move on the first day. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I didn't quite miss this so much as have trouble understanding why you considered a task which I'd broken down into no less than 16 action steps could be called "vague-sounding".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 February 2011 at 18:41 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Because those 16 steps weren't on your list.

In other words, this task consists of nothing but reviewing the project list of 16 items, thinking about the progress made so far and deciding what specific tasks need to be put on the SuperFocus list for action now. Since this is quite a limited definition, the task will normally be finished every time it comes up. Therefore it will be re-entered in Column 1.<br>"<br><br>This isnt very clear to me as a non(yet)-practitionner of SF3, but i wanted to know, would this be a good answer to your current quibble with SF3 ("big vague things" not standing out/being acted on compared to the former systems)?<br><br>Please feel free not to answer directly to me but simply comment on the "progress report #2" journal entry.<br><br>Thanks</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 February 2011 at 20:37 | Daouda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>@Alan<br>Oops, i just looked up "quibble" in the dictionnary and it doesnt quite mean what i thought it meant (Im french), so it might have sounded little bit offensive. What i meant (trying to sound like a fluent english speaker) was rather "your current PROBLEM with SF3 compared to the former systems").</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 February 2011 at 21:25 | Daouda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>With projects that contain a list of tasks that evolves over time and thought, and 'initiatives' which for me, are more vague groupings of ideas/tasks/considerations, I find that sub lists end up being places where items which have a strong resistance to doing can hide themselves, since there are no rules to process/dismiss/focus on them and gain the benefit of normal flow of the system.  For me, the off-list accounting for these items causes the system to break down because there is a different set of rules there (no rules).<br><br>Alan's mention above of Project ebook outline-&gt;WNL as an example I think brings this more granular to a specific project (which to me means that "ebook something-&gt;WNL" needs to stay on col2 until ebook = done or conciously deciding to postpone/stop doing).<br><br>The challenge (for me at least) here is that ebook WNL is a list bucket where things can go to hideout, additional ebook project related ideas/tasks can be added and then chosen to be the What's Next (the non resistive ones), and the resistive items on this offbook Ebook Project List hide.<br><br>Any thoughts on an approach that is a mirror of the main benefits of the main sf3 list on these outside lists?  Maybe a shorter split horizontally page approach where there are only 5 rows for col1 and col2?<br><br>On a related note, what could a solution look like to this electronically where lists and sublists can be merged/managed virtually in more than one way for each purpose?  To keep things simple, I'll rephrase this as : "What could SF3 look like if you had magic virtual paper that can do whatever you want and be displayed in any and multiple formats?<br><br>Keeping the paper paradigm here I think will help so it is easy to understand in discussion and keeps it simple and focused even though there are unlimitted non paper paradigms possible.<br><br>My thoughts here are possible an inlining of sublists/pages/parts of pages, maybe with different # (much less) of lines per inlined virtual page. <br><br>My thoughts specifically on this are that it is important to have organization/views of tasks as part of a project and also have tasks/subtasks in one big list that takes time of entry/progress/dismisal into consideration.<br><br>BTW- I have and use "magic paper" - a tabletpc, and writing (inking) is natural and I feel can give the best of paper and electronic.  I'll post images of any development work I do here for others to see a virtual AF/SF system if interested.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 February 2011 at 23:23 | DarrenM</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
