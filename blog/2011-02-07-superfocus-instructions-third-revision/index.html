These have been performing extremely well, so I am releasing them now. Please note these do make some considerable changes to the system as follows:</p>
<p>1) Unfinished tasks are now re-entered in Column 2 of the following page and not the same page.</p>
<p>2) Column 2 must always be cleared before moving on to the next page.</p>
<p>3) Once Column 2 of a page is filled, everything remaining on that page must be cleared the next time it is worked on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THE NEW RULES</strong>:</p>
<p><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/">Normal AF1 rules</a>, except:<br><br>1.  There is a second column (Column 2) on each page. This is used for  adding additional tasks to pages as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; a. Re-entering unfinished tasks. These are entered in Column 2 of the <em>following</em> page. If you are currently on the last page, then the following page is the first active page of the list. <br><br>&nbsp; b. Entering tasks which you want to do urgently. These are entered on the current page.<br><br>2. Column 2 is treated as a part of the page along with Column 1, with the difference that all tasks in Column 2<em> must</em> be actioned before moving on to the next page. No unactioned tasks may be left in Column 2.<br><br>3. Unfinished tasks are always re-entered in Column 2, even on the last page.<br><br>4. Once Column 2 is full, no further tasks may be entered on that page.</p>
<p>5. The <em>following</em> <em>page</em> for re-entry purposes means the next page which has any room left in Column 2. When you are currently on the last page, the <em>following page</em> is the first active page of the list. Similarly when entering urgent tasks, if column 2 of the <em>current</em> <em>page</em> is full the tasks are entered on the next page with room.</p>
<p>6. If no tasks are done in Column 1 during a visit to a page, all remaining tasks in Column 1 are dismissed. This rule does not apply to the last page of the list.</p>
<p>7. When you visit a page which is full (i.e. has no space left in Column 2), all tasks on that page must be actioned or dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>Signs and symbols</strong></p>
<p>a. When a task has been actioned, it is crossed out with a horizontal line.</p>
<p>b. When a task is dismissed it is highlighted.</p>
<p>c. When a dismissed task is reviewed and either reinstated or removed altogether, it is crossed out as it is no longer subject to review.</p>
<p>d. A page which has no active tasks left on it is marked with a cross in the outside upper corner.</p>
<p>e. When there are no active tasks left on any previous pages, the cross is surrounded with a circle.</p>
<p>f. When there are no dismissed tasks still subject to review on any previous pages, the circle is highlighted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The aim of these rule changes is to increase the flow of the system by no longer re-entering unfinished tasks on the same page. At the same time additional pressure is brought to bear to keep working on unfinished tasks. Once a task has been entered in Column 2 it must remain in Column 2 on every page until it is finished.</p>
<p>The new rule about what happens when the page is full is intended to encourage sensible use of Column 2. It is vital to the whole procedure, that one is clear in one’s own mind when a task is finished, and this needs to be defined carefully.</p>
<p>I will be publishing consolidated rules for those not acquainted with previous versions shortly.</p>

An observation and then some questions:<br><br>First, in your rules, you have no rule 3 and two rule 6. [Thanks, David, corrected! - mf]<br><br>When you say "When you visit a page which is full (i.e. has no space left in Column 2), all tasks on that page must be actioned or dismissed.", I see this as a fairly major change to AF1 rules which specify you must do something on at least one task on a page, even if it's full, in order to prevent the remaining tasks from being dismissed. It appears that now you must finish all tasks on a full page in order to prevent those tasks from being dismissed. Am I reading that correctly?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 February 2011 at 15:35 | David Coyer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Wow, finally the wait is over!<br><br>It sounds very ingenious - thanks Mark! :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 February 2011 at 16:17 | Kudos</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hurray !!!!

For example, if I have a weekly reoccurring task "clean bathroom", it would be actioned to completion, re-entered into the second column of the following page, and 'dismissed' when that second page was actioned.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 February 2011 at 16:24 | UMOarsman</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>"all tasks in Column 2 must be actioned before moving on to the next page. No unactioned tasks may be left in Column 2."<br><br>If I understand correctly, once you start something, you are not allowed to leave it behind, so every page you must work on it.  So if "Read War and Peace" is your written task, you must each SF page actually read some more War and Peace.  Is this correct?<br><br>Based on the above, I expect you actually enter  "Read one chapter" so you can occasionally escape the book.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 February 2011 at 16:38 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>David:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Am I reading that correctly?  &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, you are.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>7 February 2011 at 17:02 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Tijl:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I take it that recurring tasks are just added like any other new task (i.e. in column 1 of the last page)? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, that's correct.

In the case of War and Peace I did treat it as one long task, so I've been reading some every page of the list. This was the only task I've treated this way, otherwise I'd have slowed progress on other things too much (and fallen very quickly foul of Rule 7).<br><br>You are also correct in saying that I could have phrased the task by chapter, or by number of pages read, or even "Read a bit of W&amp;P".

I started using the new system today, and immediately came up with a query.  However, reading through my post before submitting it, I started to see things in a different way, and realise that if I'd just followed the rules as you wrote them, the query wouldn't have arisen.   I decided I would post it anyway so that you can correct me if I'm wrong, and it may be helpful to someone else.<br><br>I think where I was going wrong was in thinking that I had to stay on the same page all day because it would take more or less all day to complete  the items in columnn 2.  I thought I had to stay on the same page till all the items in column 2 were COMPLETE, rather than until all the items in column 2 had been WORKED ON.<br><br>I now realise that if I follow the rules I SHOULD cross off the task I've worked on and if it's unfinished, re-enter it in column 2 of the following page, then work on the next task that stands out, and if it's still unfinished, re-enter it on colunn 2 of the following page.  Then when all of the items in the current column 2 have been re-entered or completed, and nothing else on the page stands out, move to the next page, where all my urgent unfinished tasks will be waiting faithfully for me in column 2, and get to work on that.  It means I'll probably whizz through all 9 pages of my list quite quickly (I'm using the list I had previously rather than starting a new list today).<br><br><br>HERE IS THE ORIGINAL POST I DRAFTED:<br>I have 6 items in column 2 of the page I'm processing.  They are not urgent in the sense that they need to be done right this minute, but they all need to be completed by the end of the day.  <br><br>My Column 2 is as follows:<br><br>Post query to MF website       (that's what I'm doing now!)<br>Write cheque for window-cleaner<br>Write and post letter to C<br>Preps for appointment tomorrow<br>House ready for guests<br>Shop and cook for guests<br><br>The first three items are things that I will be able to bring to completion in one go. <br>The last three items each consist of about 10 individual  tasks, and for each one I am keeping a separate list outside SuperFocus - if I didn't my column 2 would be filled up with all these individual tasks on one visit to the page. <br><br> When I work on these multi-step items, it won't be possible (or sensible) to  bring any ot them to completion in one go, because some of the individual tasks within them are time-sensitive.  As I work through the page, when I come to one of the multi-step items and it stands out, I intend to spend about half-an-hour on it (or as long as I feel like), then move on to the next item that stands out, and spend half-an-hour on that (or if it's one of the short items, do it to completion), and so on.   So I will be rotating through the items in column 1 and column 2  in this way until all the column 2 items are complete, and nothing in column 1 stands out, and I then move on to the next active page.<br><br>My query is this: after I've worked for 'as long as I wish' on one of the items that consists of multiple tasks, and knowing that it's still not finished to completion, should I cross out the item and re-enter it at the end of my current column 2 on this page?  I feel that this would result in running out of space in column 2.  The other option would be to do the crossing out of the item only once it was completely finished.   However, if I followed the rules, I would have to re-enter the unfinished tasks on colunn 2 of the following page, and wouldn't be 'allowed' to go there till I'd completed all the tasks on the current column 2.  <br>END OF ORIGINAL POST<br><br>Mark, thanks for your patience - I'm sure you'll need plenty of that in the next few weeks, answering all our queries.<br><br>P.S.  I've spent about an hour on this post that could no doubt have been better spent on actually working my SuperFocus list, whereas if I'd just followed the rules, I'd have made some progress on my urgent tasks - a valuable lesson for me!

It's also up to you to be clear in your own mind before you begin, what "finished" means for that particular task. There are many ways to tackle larger tasks, which I will be covering soon in a post, The key thing is to keep the number of tasks in column 2 under close control so that it does not fill up too soon.<br><br>&lt;&lt; what if an old page has a column 2 that's full of crossed-out tasks from things that had been urgent on previous days.

It forces one to finish what one has started, and allows one to get on with stuff that needs doing now - but at the same time it prevents these things blocking all the other tasks that need doing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 February 2011 at 8:31 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>To be clear, if I pick up a non-urgent item to do a little because it's easy, I may put it away to the back page instead of cluttering the active column?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 February 2011 at 11:37 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Just a feet back Superfocus is incredible.

I thought I'd share my initial impressions from a few days use.<br><br>I just started with SF3 and found myself happily building my list and saying to myself "oh, that is urgent" and "oh that is urgent too". By the end of the day yesterday, I suddenly found myself with 5 pages of tasks and way too many Urgent things in column 2 on page 1. A sinking feeling came over me as I realized those things I considered Urgent were actually several days worth of work and I would never get off of page 1.  I also realized that I had tremendous resistance to some of the things Iisted in col 2.<br><br>I thought to myself that this couldn't possibly be what Mark intended, I must have missed something.  I thought about just crossing things off the list and moving them back to the end of the list as I couldn't cope with that much "Urgent" stuff, but realized that if I was going to do that I might as well not use the system at all. I would feel it was ok to "cheat" and as sneaky as as my mind can be about procrastination, I couldn't give in so easily.<br><br>So I went back and looked at column 2 on page 1 and tried to figure out how I could both  honor the sense of urgency that compelled me to put the thing in column 2 and overcome the resistance to some of the items listed. In the end it was  as simple as following the rules as written. Rule 2 to the rescue.<br><br>Actioning the task in this case was clarifying the urgency and ensuring I had properly identified an action to work on rather than just chucking a big hairy project onto the list. Once I completed this I was able to treat some items as unfinished and move them to the next page's col 2. Others felt complete once I did the thinking and spawned clearer, more detailed actions that could be added to the end of the list in Col 1 on my last page. At the end only a brief list of actionable tasks remained in Col 2 and were quickly dispatched.<br><br>Problem solved, no mental gymnastics or "tweaks" required.  The forcing functions of  completing Col 2 and working  on or dismissing items on full pages seems to be extraordinarily effective.  The things going onto the list are a lot crisper. If something ambiguous gets on the list, eventually you have to deal with it and that forces one to engage with the things one might otherwise avoid in other systems.  <br><br>Simple, and elegant, well done Mark!

Sometimes an urgent task in column 2 may become not urgent. How to deal with this situation? &gt;&gt;<br><br>This shouldn't happen too often as since the idea behind putting the task in Column 2 is that you will do it quickly - so it shouldn't have much time to become non-urgent in! But if for example your boss says "I don't need that report now until the end of next week", you can just cross out the task and re-enter it at the end of the list.<br><br>&lt;&lt; 2. Sometimes some tasks in column 1 become useless. But if it's not the time according to your instructions to dismiss them because I just finished one task in column 1, may I dismiss them anyway?

That way it had to get done! "<br><br>Did you mean that you would put it in pages ahead?  This would imply that pages correlated to calendar days, which I hadn't seen mentioned in any of the "Focus" styled systems.  DIT or DWM, yes but AFx or SF, no.<br><br>-OR- did you simply mean that on the day you intend to walk, you put that task in column 2 of whatever your current page happens to be...  I think this is what you must have meant.<br><br>I have a strong affinity to your systems that include a time factor - what can get done in a day.  Then my "to-do" list (or in DIT "will do" list) is also a sort of journal of "did-do"'s... This is useful in a review when I would ask myself a question like: "So what’s been better since we spoke yesterday?" ;)<br><br>Anyway, I was hoping you'd clear up that ambiguity about your daily walk entries and if you have any advice about 'dealing with the day', I'd be interested in hearing it.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Michael</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 April 2011 at 9:51 | Michael K</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Michael:<br><br>I meant that on the day I intend to walk I put the task in Column 2 of whatever my current page happens to be.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 April 2011 at 10:30 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
