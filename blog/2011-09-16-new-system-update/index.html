Using this method one commences by just writing down a few tasks which one wants to be getting on with, and then by adding further tasks as one thinks of them or as they come up in the normal course of work. This is the method I would usually recommend people to use.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods:</p>
<p>1) With the “everything at once” method, you can be sure you haven’t forgotten anything. On the other hand some of what you put in the list may not be relevant any longer, and during the period during which the system reduces the list to a manageable size there is a lack of focus of effort. You could of course spend some time editing and weeding the tasks before entering them in the system but, since the whole idea of a “universal capture” system is that you don’t pre-edit, it might be considered contrary to the aim of the system.</p>
<p>2) With the “gradual build-up” method, there is less initial strain on the system. All the tasks will be current and fresh and the weeding out will be much less drastic. There is however a danger that some important work may be forgotten - though in practice I have always found this is less of a problem than one would think.</p>
<p>Once the list has grown to a reasonable size, I’ll report back to tell you how I am progressing.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Sounds good, Mark.   In the past I've just used my previous list when moving to one of your newer systems, but this time I think I'll try the gradual build-up method, and add a task "Check old SF list for urgent stuff".

The very nature of testing is that it is unpredictable. However I have also made it clear that the system is unlikely to be ready before the end of November, if then.<br><br>What would you prefer me to do?

As new tasks come in they are listed on the diary page for the following day. If a task has to be done on a specific day some time in the future, it can be listed on that day. The result is that as you come to each page in the diary, you have a list already built up for that day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>17 September 2011 at 16:28 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>TK:<br><br>&lt;&lt; When you say "book" I don't know if you mean ebook or paperback.  &gt;&gt;<br><br>As I said earlier I haven't yet made any decisions on what form the book will take or how it will be distributed.
