<p>What I’m going to do is to stop using all aids to time management and rely only on the <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/25/the-most-important-thing-ive-ever-written.html">“Feeling Good”</a> method to regulate what I do.</p>
<p>Will it work? I’ve no idea!</p>
<p>But if it does, it could be really sensational.</p>

"...stop using all aids..." Does this mean RAF is being dropped or side lined for a period of time? I've experimented with many of your systems Mark, AF1 and FV were two I used for several months, but RAF was on another level for me--including numerous productivity methods that I have tried outside of your creations. (I do recognize the boost I get from trying a new system, but RAF has been different in many ways even though I've only used it a few days.) Obviously, if it continues to work, then I will continue to use it. Even though I know and support that your site is about new methods, etc.,  I do admit that I was hoping to see the kind of discussion on this site regarding RAF that FV/FVP generated.

I'm wondering if the choices of what to do will be a matter of how one phrases/re-phrases tasks/chores/options. For example, rather than "Buggerit! I'm detesting doing my bloody tax return" one could say, "I feel good getting my tax return done and out of here!"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>30 July 2017 at 18:26 | Fiona</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I recommend the work of Danielle Laporte - specifically The Desire Map - she has been operating with this philosophy for years and has written a lot about it, and trained facilitators to lead workshops all over. Her work doesn't specifically outline itself as being for women but it is very feminine and I doubt many men have heard of her. The feeling good experiment? Maybe you're getting in touch with your feminine side? I would love to know what you think of The Desire Map!

So maybe one possiblity could be to force oneself to start with a task despite the feeling is not enough for the task.<br>Sure if I really feel to bad a very intensive task wouldn't make sense but what about mind tools just before the decision what to do.<br>For example consider:<br>If I should do a patent research for a new developed device and I rather would do more design work to create this new device in the best way.<br>Maybe it make sense to hold on just short before decide and ask yourself why I want to do this now? <br>As I understood the decision making in the brain can depend on the experiences someone make in the life till now, so when my experience of patent research is not exciting enough and maybe disappointing compared to the design of the new device I rather will do that.<br>But If I hold on a second and bring this in my mind to be aware of this processes of my mind I would decide in the other way.<br><br>What do you think about this?

Could just be the novelty of course.<br><br>By the way I am not using the questions to replace a task list.
