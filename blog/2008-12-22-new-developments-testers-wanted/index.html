Looking forward to the unveiling is almost like having two xmas's to look forward to.  Whether we "take to it" or not is only half the value of the experience.

I recently became "between jobs" and my life is totally disorganized.  I was getting ready to get serious with DIT again since it's the best system I know to get my act together.<br><br>I'm ready to dig in - if I can't break your system, nobody can!<br><br>I tweeted about this as MyklK - so you should be getting a flood of test subjects, but you can handle it ;)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 December 2008 at 17:46 | MyklK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark,<br><br>I signed up for Beta testing your new system.

DIT works really well for me right now. I find the system similar to budgeting money, except it's budgeting tomorrow's time.<br><br>One thing I struggle with, and not sure the new system will cover, is the 'project management' side. Figuring out which projects to follow and when in my life to do them. Once I have an active project, I can go through the tasks fairly well. But I have issues with life goal planning. MS Project seems overkill for this and not sure which tools can be used for this. Excel seems ok, but it's not perfect since I have to run multiple systems.<br><br>Thanks for your hard work and sharing with the community!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 December 2008 at 18:46 | Keyur</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi,<br>I signed up.

("Interesting" is possibly an understatement.)<br><br>As a side note, never underestimate the power of a week of snow days to catch up on things... but I don't think that's a sustainable system long term!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 December 2008 at 20:05 | Les</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Let's all hope that in one week and six days, Mark doesn't announce that the system doesn't really work after all &lt;grin&gt;</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 December 2008 at 20:39 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark, It's great to be part of the party!
