So I taken the decision that I’m going to be concentrating on that from now on.</p>
<p>At the same time I’ve found out lots more about how Simple Scanning works and about what makes it suitable as the vehicle for High Intensity Use of Time.</p>
<p>Here are three characteristics which make it faster and more effective than any other long-list system:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Clumping</li>
<li>Attenuation</li>
<li>Maturity&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next few days I shall be writing about each of these (not necessarily in that order) to show how they work together to produce the high intensity.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>What is the right abbreviation to use for High Intensity Use of Time?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 December 2017 at 17:11 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Looking forward to this to see what I may be missing.

When I write down a new task on my list, sometimes this will remind me of related items. <br>2. So I write down the related items as well.<br><br>That's the first level of clumping.<br><br>Then as you work the list:<br>1. When something stands out, it's because I am ready to work on that item. <br>2. Therefore it is likely that similar/related items will also stand out, even if they aren't adjacent on the list.<br>3. I know from previous experience with all long-list systems, when I am on a roll, I tend to "hunt" for similar items, wanting to get them all done, or at least consolidate them in one place. This will tend to amplify the effect.<br>4. If any of those items are re-entered on the list, they will be re-entered as a clump.<br><br>This is the second level of clumping. It will tend to feed and amplify the first level -- a virtuous cycle of clumping.<br><br>If you stay with a set of related tasks for any period of time, you will tend to keep working near the end of the list. This accelerates and compounds the clumping. So that's the third level of clumping. It will tend to feed and amplify the third level -- a virtuous cycle of clumping. <br><br>With these virtuous cycles accelerating the effect, you will get lots of clumping.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 December 2017 at 23:45 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Seraphim:<br><br>Thank you for a very clear description of how clumping works.

After I do the earlier items during the first scans, the other items are left.<br><br>With DIT, I find that even though I don't want to do some of the items themselves, there is a pressure to do everything in the closed list. This helps maintain the maxim that on average the amount incoming work must equal the amount of outgoing work.<br><br>With Simple Scanning, I find that I fall into the trap of adding items to the list expecting that merely by doing so that everything will magically get done. There is no pressure to do anything, which, I think, is by design. Therefore, it must be a lack of willpower and self-discipline on my part and not a fault of the system. Maybe DIT just works better for me by creating that daily goal of clearing the list. I'm not sure.<br><br>I haven't given up on Simple Scanning. That's why I hope to find out what I'm missing.<br><br>One thing I love about your systems and this site is the amount of introspection that I am forced to do. Why am I working?

I reread this article (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/10/9/thoughts-on-the-long-list-making-everything-easy.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/10/9/thoughts-on-the-long-list-making-everything-easy.html</a> ) which has got me thinking.

For example if I'm halfway through a task and I get the idea to do something else I can add the new thing to the list and then decide whether I'm going to change to a new task or whether to park it and come back later. This has the advantage of not forgetting or ignoring the new task but helps make a more conscious decision. For me it helps reduce anxiety over the sense that I may have forgotten something. The full autofocus list is like an orchestra all playing at once. The actionable step is just the next bar on the instrument I pick up.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>27 April 2021 at 16:03 | michael</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
