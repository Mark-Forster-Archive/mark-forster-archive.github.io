I had misgivings (eg won't I just pick the low hanging fruit? what about unpleasant, but "must do" projects? contexts? urgent stuff? duplication? etc etc), but these are fading with use. It looks like V2 will address these issues once and for all.<br><br>I agree with Charles: thank you very much for making this system freely available (and thanks also to the forum regulars for their ideas on how to get the best from Autofocus).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 10:39 | Adrian Trenholm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>considering the delay, I wonder if the new system really  helps to publish blog posts on time</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 11:00 | M_N</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Thanks Mark, I think you're correct in getting the details right before feeling the need to release it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 11:31 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>thanks Mark <br>Take the time necessary for the system to be available.

Having struggled to get back into AF and becoming REALLY disorganiased after going on holiday I tried to today to strictly apply the rules and realised where I had been going wrong - not following the rules.  For that reason I appreciate how important it is for you to get the rules right before release<br><br>Many thanks</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 12:30 | Mark J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'm really curious how much I will have to change for autofocus.cc to work with the AF2 rules. I know you said we can use the same list with both systems, but my guess is that won't hold for a digital implementation that really models the workflow.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 12:47 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>@M_N: I'm not aware of any deadlines Mark missed due to using the new system. It also seems illogical to draw any conclusions concerning the effectiveness of a system that is *not finished yet*.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 12:50 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark,<br><br>Dismissal tweaks ? Excellent.  Now I am even more excited about the upcoming launch.  With a holiday weekend coming in the US, I might even be able to take time to change over cleanly.<br><br>As far as I have gotten, you have already tweaked it in the blog comments, but it will be great to see it formalized in its own release.<br><br>You need to get more than just fame recognition for this wonderful system. Maybe it is time to make the process into an ebook.  You can always send out updates to the buyers.  or even an updated version of DIT with AF2 combined in.<br><br>looking forward to the new system.

My concern is the cultish requirements to follow the rules.

But my advice would be to keep the old one going as well because I expect some people will continue to prefer AF1.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 13:14 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>@M_N, I wonder which "delay" you're referring to. When is "on time" supposed to have been, in your imagination...?<br><br>@mbo1915, I'm not sure what you think "using your brain" involves. Perhaps you want to become acquainted with the notion of a "procedure". Alternatively, you might find it enlightening to attempt making something like Beef Wellington by "using your brain" as opposed to yielding to the "cultish requirement" of following a recipe...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 13:19 | Lefty</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>M_N:<br><br>What delay was that?

I think I'd do that to show appreciation and express the value of what you have produced.<br><br>Is there enough material on this blog relating to AF for you to produce a book or an ebook?<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to get the system just right - looking forward to it.<br><br>-Christian</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 14:29 | Christian Selvaratnam</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'd go for that, too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 15:14 | Lefty</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I second (third?) the suggestion for a donation link, or an ebook, or a proper book. I've been using AutoFocus for 3 months now, and it's the first system that really works for me and that I continue using instead of switching to something else after a few weeks. So I would buy a book or ebook, or make a donation if asked for, if only to show my support for all the work you're doing for us.<br><br>Thanks Mark, and looking forward to AF2</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 15:30 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'm looking forward to the release of AF2 when you've got perfected (I'm also excited to discover I'm part of a cult)!<br><br>Following the comments about releasing an ebook with details of the AF system, I wondered if you knew about Darren Rowse's new blogging book <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.problogger.net/31dbbb-workbook/">http://www.problogger.net/31dbbb-workbook/</a> Although this book is a compilation of information that is already available on his website, it has sold a large number of copies because people like to have a book rather than having to go on to the internet when they want to refer to it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 15:56 | Kate Davis</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>@everyone I'm guessing that M_N is just as anxious to try the new system as the rest of us, but doesn't know how to show it properly.  I don't really think anyone that's not a fan of Autofocus (and who couldn't be a fan?) would be here.<br><br>No harm, I say.<br><br>Mark: thanks for your time and effort - I'm really looking forward to your new version!

That way more folk will get to know of Mark and he will get his royalties.  Now, you do have a first copy of your own, right everyone ?  <br><br>This model is similar to the musicians who leave the big labels and self publish for free on the web.

Although I am glad that Mark avoids the image of a hyper productive everything done-guru, I got the impression that  even AF 2,0 might not be the miracle cure for writing goals that some of us - including me - were anticipating. <br><br>Once the fabricated exitement about AF2,0 has ended, the fanboys have sobered up and moved on from being "properly" (@Anon_LF) exited, there will be new great impulses and creative ideas from Mark to try out. I find the high expectations revealing: Maybe progress on one's most important tasks depends less on circumstances and systems than we like to think.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 June 2009 at 17:33 | M_N</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>M_N: There are no miracle cures.

But on a paper book you can show examples, have a real executive summury, have the pleasure to turn the pages, to go backward, forward. Most of all a real book can go in a library as a reference. Since over 20 years i still have the best book i ever red about negociation from MarkHCormack "all you will never learn at harvard" hope my translation is good for i have it in French. It is so annotated and highlined that sometime i need to read it carefully just to understand. <br><br>If Mark, you make a real book about AF, i hope it will be created as a practical manual may be a collect of little summury with example because your method is so great that it must be applied step by step. <br><br>I didn't at the beginning and this was my mistake. Now i stricktly apply the method and things goes well excepts about what you mentioned at the beginning of this thread. <br><br>This is the reason why this waiting for AF2 so tease me. I am sure i gona learn a lot from it and really hope to solve a big parts of the difficulties i encountered with AF(1).
