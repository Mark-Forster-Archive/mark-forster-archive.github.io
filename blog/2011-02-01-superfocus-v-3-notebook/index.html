It probably all depends on one's situation. Personally, I would always lean towards the portability side.

Women have a clear advantage here, since they carry around handbags anyway :-) <br><br>Regarding left and right pages: I'd much rather keep the currently 'interesting' tasks on one page (that's one reason why I'm so vocal about DIT's advantages). Many times, you don't see both page of a notebook at the same time comfortably, which would probably defeat some of the principles of SF (as I understand it). <br><br>Plus, I have some ideas about using the opposite side for additional notes.<br><br>Regards, <br>Alex</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 February 2011 at 0:25 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>&lt;&lt;Sorry, I don't follow your reasoning. Why does the narrowness of the rule make it easier to have two columns?&gt;&gt;<br><br>Narrower line rule = smaller penmanship = more letters &amp; words written in a given space = easier to make columns.

Yes the tip make easiest the reading of the unfinished tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 February 2011 at 7:10 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Sorry Alex I had probably assumed that you were looking to use a smaller version of the moleskin that fitted in your pocket - in my experience many men prefer to do this which is understandable.<br><br>It's really interesting how fired up people get about their notebooks - I guess it is because they hold something precious to them, and some people feel it manifasts their taste somehow. However I am the first to admit that writting in a notebook for which you have a connection is a very pleasurable experience. <br><br>I spent many years going for the cheapest option. Then I bought a pack of 5 A4 snopake notepads to take notes at work, with a hard cover, and I realised what I had been missing. Sure they were expensive, but they have lasted me ages, they take fountain pen very well when I am in the mood to use it, and they have a very helpful rulling - large enough for my writing with little tabs top and bottom to help you draw nice straight lines.<br><br>The point for me is that having a nice tool to do your 'work' makes you feel good, possibly leading to better performance. I am certainly more likely to use a book that I really love than one which I bought because it was 'cheaper'.  (Not that I am assuming you all buy cheap notebooks!  This is my observation only).  Another style of book that is lovely to use are Paperblanks - you can sometimes pick these up in sales and on ebay.<br><br>I'm sad to say I am a  victim of stationery rather than a user as I love it in all its forms!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 February 2011 at 8:48 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Sorry to be a little off topic here but Mark you have been prolific of  late! As another poster noted, there is a new energy here, and its rubbing off on a lot of others too. No doubt the new system is behind all of this renewed vitality, and I appreciate the fact that you have put so much of your past work into context ahead of the release of your latest variation. <br><br>I get a sense that things are  rising to a crescendo, but personally I wouldn't mind it if it gets a little quiet  after that.

There must be a skill in that. Looking back through my book, it looks like mine average at about 4 words per item, most needing much more than half the width of the page. So using facing pages for columns 1 and 2 will likely continue to be necessary for me. I have also been using alternate lines, because I don't like clutter - but in the notebook I am using that only gives me 12 items per page, which I am not starting to realise probably doesn't work so well (am I right?), so I think I'd better revise that practice!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 February 2011 at 8:22 | Steve Schapel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Steve Schapel:<br><br>&lt;&lt; the most striking aspect of the photo ... is the number of items on Mark's list that seem to be expressed in 1 or 2 words.

It should start with a verb.<br><br>That's good advice. It turns a list of stalled projects into list of actions that will get done. David Allen explains this well.<br><br>However, if it's always the same verb, I don't need to write it down. Most of the time, "email " means deal with urgent items, then work on the backlog. No need to write that out each time. <br><br>If I want to do something else about email, I write that down. Maybe I want to get serious about the backlog. Maybe I need to concentrate on emails from Joe. In that case, I'll write the extra details. If the backlog is extremely long and I know I'll keep putting off difficult ones, I might write "email Jan 2010".<br><br>If I write a project name with no verb, the verb is either "plan" or "continue to work on". Often, writing the key steps of the plan as separate lines helps break it into doable chunks, but it's not always necessary.<br><br>It's an individual choice and changes with the day. The only downside is there's more writing -- a small price to pay if it helps you get everything done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 February 2011 at 14:39 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Cricket:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I think the long entries come from the advice that every action item should be an action.

This also comes in A5 size.<br><br>What I like most is that being wire bound the pages lay totally flat &amp; Being left handed this seems to help me.<br><br>But back to AF, I've failed. I had been putting dates on my pages (would you recommend this?)  and found that after adding lots of notes in Outlook I then got so overwhelmed by how many notes I'd made over a short time that I'd then move them over to AF - and then forget about them. This would repeat every once in a while and before I knew it I stopped looking at AF because it was so depressing to see on what a gigantic scale I had failed!<br><br>Eeeek! last entry 31.5.10.<br><br>Oh and I started using three colours of pen: red = sales (i.e. most important) black = general office stuff and finally blue = home, i.e. low priority when compared to work etc. Needless to say there's more untouched red (sales tasks) than anything else.<br><br>My problem is that I do so much on the PC writing anything down (neatly) just doesn't fit in with what I do.<br><br>I the bug myself over not letting the system help me. Then remind myself what your seminars cost....good value but wasted if I don't follow your lead.<br><br>Oh and then there's the time timer.....bought two, batteries went flat. I've probably got a note in AF to buy new batteries!!<br><br>Ok, so tonight I'm going to take another look at AF maybe some housekeeping before you release your new version....this will involve adding to a very old list. Maybe I should detach my detachable pages, rewrite and start again?<br><br>Any advice?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 February 2011 at 18:40 | AlanJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Start a new list. The old list is a backlog. One of your new list's items could be "check if that old list has anything useful". Occasionally do that item, and kill stuff off that backlog.<br><br>If you're always with PC, it works well to use the PC to track the list. Outlook has been used successfully by some. Or use a notebook. Your choice. But keep it simple. <br><br>And if you sign up for an account here, we can discuss details in a forum thread.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 February 2011 at 19:50 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>My notebook is a legal pad, and I use the entire page.

I agree with the advantages you mentioned.  The major disadvantage is the amount of time I would spend with my head in my hands staring glumly at an entry of "Bill: Project X" with questions churning through my mind, such as "Did I tell Bill I would phone or email? Or was it that I was to send him some stuff?" and "What was the date again when he was to be back from his holiday?"  Maybe it's a memory thing?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>5 February 2011 at 2:20 | Steve Schapel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Alan Baljeu wrote:<br>&gt; The pending arrival of V3 is making further discussion of known systems moot.<br><br>I hope that this is intended to be a joke and thinking like that never becomes a general consensus on this site.<br><br>What works well for one person, may be completely unsuitable for someone else's work and life.
