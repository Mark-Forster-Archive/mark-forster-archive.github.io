Indeed this is the foundation of the “no list” idea - to keep yourself actively working on the projects you are involved in.</p>
<p>This new system now gives 100% flexibility + 100% freshness +100% openness to <em><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/14/working-in-the-present.html">little and often</a> +</em> 100% effectiveness at providing a framework for developing routines and systems.</p>
<p>Impossible? No.</p>
<p>What can I tell you about it at this stage?</p>
<p>Really only that it’s a <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/12/what-is-a-no-list-system.html">“no-list” system</a> and that all the principles behind it have been thoroughly tested out and debated on this website in the past. There’s no new magic ingredient - it’s just the way existing ideas have been combined.</p>
<p>It ticks all the boxes that I identified for the perfect <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/2/types-of-lists-ix-an-effective-no-list-system.html">“no list” system</a> and goes beyond that.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark<br>Have you decided how we get access to the system.

They imply that the donations button is only for registered charities and non-profits but I've seen many private individuals using them so it's not clear.<br><br>In the end, for my own website donations button, I decided some time ago that it was safer to not have one at all after having had a PayPal button for years.
