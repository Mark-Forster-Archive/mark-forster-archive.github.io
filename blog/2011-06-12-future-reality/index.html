<p>Different people will probably come up with different ways of doing this, but at the moment I am finding that it is very powerful to re-type and revise my Future Reality first thing every morning, and to re-type and revise my Present Reality every evening. This seems to provide the impetus to work towards the vision throughout the day. In fact this impetus is strong enough for me to no longer feel the need to ask the question “Is this what I want to be doing?”</p>
<p>My initial version of my Future Reality was written on 27 May. Since then it has expanded, contracted to one sentence and expanded again. Here are the two versions for comparison:</p>
<p><em>27 May</em></p>
<p><em>I am living a very well-ordered life in which the principles of “How To Make Your Dreams Come True” are put fully into practice. I love creating and everything I set my hands to comes to fruition effortlessly. I am extremely healthy and fit. I have a close circle of friends. All this makes me feel alive, full of energy and peaceful.</em></p>
<p><em>12 June</em></p>
<p><em>I am living a powerful, well-ordered and creative life in which everything gets done when it needs to be done. I’m supported in my work by a tidy and efficient office. The Dreams Manual has been a great success and I am teaching its principles through seminars, teleconferences and the internet, while living entirely by those principles myself. I am extremely fit and full of energy and enjoy long-distance walking, yoga and physical challenges (including passing the 100 push-ups challenge). I run a highly successful blog for ……. and this has resulted in a lot of new members. I speak and read French with fluency. I naturally attract people who share my enthusiasm for living and this is resulting in some amazing friendships. I love the sense of freedom and achievement that all this gives me.</em></p>
<p>Once I’ve written today’s Present Reality this evening, I’ll post a similar comparison.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Thanks for posting these, Mark. One of my resistances to the Future Reality exercise is that I could make it go a whole page, because I feel it has to cover my work, my relationship to my wife, my personal projects, my exercise/diet, etc. I feel as if there are SO MANY areas of my life where I want to see improvement, that I feel EVERYTHING has to be included. <br><br>Perhaps this is an example of your metaphor of "you can't eat everything on the menu." Perhaps if I climb a little higher up the hill I could find some common themes that would be more suited to the FR exercise. (I have started keeping a separate FR at work, one for each of my big projects, and then one 'bigger' one encompassing attitudes and habits.)<br><br>I LOVE the idea of writing the FR in the morning and the CR in the evening. That sounds like a great idea.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>12 June 2011 at 14:17 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mike:<br><br>I agree Mike.

Covey calls them roles. They usually list 5-12 areas. I don't know if Mark has somethings similar. As you do your review, focus on each area in turn.<br><br>A perfectly-balanced life has a perfectly-balance wheel, but in the short-term it's hardly ever balanced. In the mid- and long-term, over-doing an area is just as un-balancing as short-changing one. <br><br>Don't worry about finding the perfect list. As you do the exercise for a few months, you'll see areas that need to be split and ones that can be combined to meet your current life.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>13 June 2011 at 16:06 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hello Mark,<br><br>I did not have time to re-read all comments and articles, so I'm sorry if this has already been asked.

During that period concentrate your attention as vividly as possible upon one simple statement.  Repeat it over and over while focusing on it for this time ... Do not allow distractions, but if your mind insists upon running about then channel its images in line with your declaration.  The repetition, verbally or mentally, is important because it activates biological patterns and reflects them.  Do not strain .... During this period ... remember that you are using the present as a moment of power to insert new beliefs and that these will be materialized.  When the exercise is finished do not dwell upon it .... Three days at the very least are necessary before you can tell, through results, how effective it has been .... You may experience spectacular results at once.  But continue the exercise even if this happens.  Inner channels must be repatterened.  There will be a feel to this that will serve as your own individual guideline.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 July 2012 at 12:50 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>...and a contrary view:<br><br>"" It is good that life never fulfils your dreams - it always goes on disposing, in a way.

The problem is that the ego always regards the future as where all it's sense of lack is fixed.<br><br>The brain often wants what the heart doesn't have a desire for. The ego fails to connect itself to a larger flow of life. Step 1 is therefore to reduce the momentum the ego has built up in this unaligned direction, separating heart desires from ego wants. Future reality needs filtering through that process.<br><br>It also needs filtering by becoming aware of the resistances to the heart's desires. The future reality will be incomplete until the voice of fear over a future reality has been acknowledged. There will be several consequences to this imagined reality, not all of which will be ok within the unconscious.<br><br>There also needs to be leeway in your future reality. The brain may have a poor idea of what is best for you as it projects from past habits and conditioning in an attempt to fix what it sees as lacking. So our grip of future reality must not be too tight - a blueprint more than a final copy.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>21 May 2014 at 11:29 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>One angle that doesn't seem to have been tried is comparing Future Reality with current Autofocus. ie. do current actions imply future reality, and does imagined future inspire current autofocus list?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>26 July 2019 at 18:45 | michael</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
