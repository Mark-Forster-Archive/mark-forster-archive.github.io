This was a system which I developed in response to the perception that Autofocus had difficulty dealing with urgent tasks once the list had grown beyond a certain size - which it inevitably did.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Autofocus 2 suffered from the same problem in reverse. It was great at dealing with urgent tasks - which is why I still use it for panic lists - but not so good at dealing with non-urgent tasks, particularly the more difficult ones which tended to congregate at the beginning of the list.</p>
<p>So I’ve been looking at how I can improve Autofocus 2 so that it keeps its ability to deal with urgent tasks, but keeps the work going on the beginning of the list as well.</p>
<p>I’ve found a very simple change which seems to solve the problem. Just divide the list into two. Here’s how:</p>
<p>1. Draw up a list of things to be done. Keep it reasonably short at this stage. My first attempt was 23 tasks long and so far it’s working fine.</p>
<p>2. Draw a line at the end of the list. Everything that you enter or re-enter from now on goes after the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. You have now two parts, the Old List and the New List.</p>
<p>4. You scan from the end of the Old List back towards the beginning of the list. When you come to a task that stands out as being ready to do, you do it. Then delete it and, if there is still work to be done on it or if it will recur again within the next few days, re-enter it at the end of the New List.</p>
<p>5. Now scan back from the end of the New List in the same way. When a task stands out do it and re-enter it as necessary.</p>
<p>6. If no task stands out continue your scan in the Old List as in 4.</p>
<p>7. Continue in this way, scanning for one task in each list alternately until there are no more tasks in the Old List. When this happens draw a line at the end of the New List which becomes the Old List, and start a New List.</p>
<p>8. Please note carefully that if no task stands out in a List, just carry straight on to the other list. But if a task does stand out, once you’ve done it you do not scan further in that list but move immediately to the other list.</p>
<p>The rules sound more complicated than they actually are. In fact it’s a very simple procedure.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to accompany me in this experiment, please do so. Your comments are welcome.</p>
<p>P.S. Make sure that 1) you always scan backwards from the end of a list towards the beginning. 2) you only pick one task before moving on to the other list.</p>
<p>One last point. <span>When the Old List is down to just a few tasks and none of them get selected on repeated scans of the list you may either delete them or move them to the end of the New List (which will then be free to become the Old List).</span></p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>AF2 is one of my favourite methods so I'll give this a try.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 December 2020 at 17:10 | Caibre65</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'll be happy to give this one a shot. I gave up on the Nov. 29th system pretty quickly -- there's an oppressive feeling deep in my chest sometimes when a system doesn't work. I get that feeling if I go back to a straight-up GTD or even on occasion going back to my Franklin Planner. Too much overhead or something. Before that, I had been using skedpal and loving it, but there was getting to be too much work in setting it up and entering tasks with the right variables. I missed the simplicity of the autofocus systems where you just wrote stuff on a list. Then I tried your "same old thing" system and it has been really amazing! I've been meaning to write about it. It seems to have all the benefits of Random (melting procrastination especially) with more control over what I do. I love it! And I'm able to melt my list like wax and I feel great. So I'll try this new variation of AF2, but I think I have a new standard to return to now.

Its interesting that even after all thr systems you have developed it still comes down to balancing urgent and less urgent items. When I first read the rules it made me think of AF4 rather thsn AF2 given Old and New lists. I have always been more keen on AF systems than FV systems because to me AF rules largely take the decision making out of your hands whereas FV meant (to me at least) that you were always asking yourself the question of what to do next. Given the time of year unlikely to be able to use any system over next couple of weeks but will give this more of a go. It reminds me of a version on AF1 I used years ago. On 20 line pages I would have a rule that I would only do one item per page but always had to do one. Similar in a way to the Ten Task system. Anyway thanks for ALL the systems, there is something there for every one!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>24 December 2020 at 8:27 | skeg</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I wasn’t happy with moving the whole list to Old and starting a new list empty, so I’m making an amendment: When the Old List is clesr, instead of drawing a line at the bottom, I’m drawing a new line more towards the middle. You decide if that means one day back or all-but-one, or whatever. Anyway, urgent items remain in New, and some previously neglected items get to the bottom of the Old and will  get attention.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>31 December 2020 at 14:50 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Alan:<br><br>Yes, that sounds as if it would work well.

Using my rules in this blog post, you are scanning backward. That means that when the New List is the smaller, the tasks you come to first in the Old List are quite new. When the Old List is the smaller, then there are relatively few tasks in it, and you may well by-pass it under Rule 8 without choosing a task.<br><br>So whatever the balance of the Old and New lists, you can choose all new tasks (or all old tasks for that matter).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 January 2021 at 0:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Despite the words “please note carefully”, I didn’t notice that rule at all!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 January 2021 at 16:12 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hello all.<br>Hello Mark<br><br>Thanks for share this idea.<br>I want to ask if this system better compare to FVP?
