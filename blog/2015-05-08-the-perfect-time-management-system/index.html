Finally, after twenty years of thinking about little else (or at least that’s how it felt), I have at last managed to invent it.</p>
<p>I hope this will be an incalculable boon to humankind. Imagine, no more frustration at not being able to trust yourself to achieve what you want. Imagine, always being able to decide to do something and know that you will do it. Imagine, being able to unfailingly steer the optimum path through all the clashing priorities of daily life.</p>
<p>The system is very simple. Once you know it you will be hard pressed to think why it would take one person five minutes to think up, let alone twenty years. Yet, as far as I know no one else has ever thought of it before.</p>
<p>Here are a few characteristics of the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a “universal capture” system, i.e. you can enter any task or project without any pre-editing or prioritizing.</li>
<li>It’s equally suitable for pen and paper or electronic means.</li>
<li>It can deal with any size list, from the smallest to the largest.</li>
<li>No matter what order the tasks are written in, it will always give you the optimum path through them.</li>
<li>It has no problem with urgent tasks.</li>
<li>It encourages “little and often”.</li>
<li>You can attend meetings and write down tasks and queries straight into the list.</li>
<li>Resistance becomes a thing of the past.</li>
<li>You can enter provisional tasks, i.e. ones you haven’t decided definitely whether to do them or not.</li>
<li>You can brainstorm straight onto the list</li>
<li>It requires no randomizers or other equipment.</li>
<li>and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be writing more about this in a week or so’s time.</p>

(e.g. Alfred Korzybski wrote about these exact stages when describing acquisition of any new meaning). But I would say that what you forgot is that this process did not end in<br><br> &gt;&gt;and then everything settles down and we go back to what we were doing before :)&lt;&lt;<br><br>but in USING the (method, advice, Mark`s tip or new meaning in Korzybski`s sense) - maybe sometimes, maybe when appropriate, maybe in individualized way, maybe integrated with previous experiences. In the end, our views and approaches how to deal with tasks/work ARE definitely CHANGED. And for me, it is the meaning of all our discussions, ideas we share, tweaks.

And in any case you know my opinion - the only system that works is the one where you roll up your sleeves and do stuff, not the one where you spend all day moving notes about stuff through a system according to some algorithm, which can provide a wonderful tool for procrastination.
