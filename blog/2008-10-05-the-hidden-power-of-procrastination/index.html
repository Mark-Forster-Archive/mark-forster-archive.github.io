<p>I came across John Perry’s hilarious article <a href="http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/index.php" target="_blank">Structured Procrastination</a> the other day. It is in the finest tradition of humour which tells more truth than the serious articles. Another great exemplar in the time management field is J. Northcote Parkinson’s <em>Parkinson’s Law</em>.</p>
<p>Reading John Perry’s article cast light on something which had puzzled me for years. To describe what it is I have to go back to the first time management system I ever invented - something like twelve years ago. This was a form of open-ended To Do list. Unlike the standard advice about To Do lists I made no attempt to order it or prioritise it. Nor was I particularly careful about what I put into the list. Anything which occurred to me or crossed my mind went into the list. So the result would be a long list which contained everything I could think of. And as I thought of new stuff all the time, the list would grow rapidly.</p>
<p>Since the list was not prioritised in any way, my method of working the list was to go through it continually from one end to the other. Whenever an item “stood out” to me I would do it. Any recurrent items like “Email” would be re-entered at the end of the list once completed.</p>
<p>This type of To Do list was extremely efficient for getting a lot done. However the disadvantage was that a lot of items didn’t get done. Some items would stay on the list for weeks.</p>
<p>What I realised after reading John Perry’s article was that the items which don’t get done provide the motive power for what does get done. In other words the price we pay for the things we succeed in doing is the things we leave undone.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>+JMJ+<br><br>Ah, I remember reading this years ago in this forum, but it never sunk into my mind...probably because of the dismissal-focused mindset we all had before.

The simplicity is definitely a whiff of fresh air for me, as I have been experimenting with quite complex systems before.  Since I go through each page only once per pass, I go through the whole list at least once a day (once is actually very rare; I usually go through the list many times a day). The mess, on the other hand, I think helps with the "standing out" process.  I don't know why, but it seems to me that it does.  And the number of undone items? Well, as long as I remember the dictum<br><br>"What you haven’t done is the price you paid for what you have done."<br><br>they are not a source of anxiety, but actually a sense of I am doing the right things. Especially when I noticed what types of tasks I weren't doing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 January 2012 at 4:37 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>nuntym:<br><br>It sounds like you are having more success with it than I did. But maybe that's because I hadn't appreciated at the time that the undone tasks were providing the motive power for the other tasks to get done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 January 2012 at 11:03 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>nuntym,<br>I work in a very similar way using the AF list with a few simple modifications to cope with the number of people asking me to do stuff. I have found that by simply numbering the pages and items within the page I have a continual list of tasks in the order they crop up. I also add the date when the day changes so I know which items were added on what day. I am currently on page 205 and keep these in a loose leaf file. When reviewing an undone task that I want to move on I try to re-phrase or chunk it and then add it as a new item on my current page. This does help to try and get some action and the older pages are then just archive info for me to refer to. The joy of this is the simplicity and I have understood over time that some things on the list never get ticked off. They are still there to refer to periodically and if necessary / following a periodic review may get added to the end with new purpose. Reviewing back over these items is also interesting as the perceived urgency at the time is not always correct</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 January 2012 at 12:22 | Tony</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Tony:<br><br>Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?<br><br>1) How long approximately has it taken you to get to p. 205?<br><br>2) Have you been consciously aware of the "items which don’t get done provide the motive power for what does get done" effect?<br><br>3) Have you found that through working the list new priorities and goals have emerged naturally?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 January 2012 at 12:32 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark<br>It has taken me just over a year to get to page 205. I have between 20 and 25 items per page and when I file associated info I can refer to my list (for example 205.12) which is helpful when asked 2 months later by someone for info. As long as I know approx when the job was done I can scan the pages real quick and the referencing is easy to get further paperwork if required.<br><br>Regarding the motive power for what does get done effect? I haven't thought about this really before but maybe the list process does create a drive of its own. I procrastinate now as much as I always did but at least I am aware of what is not getting done. The one improvement for me is limiting myself to loose leaf sheets. I only ever have 2 pages out of my file (otherwise they will get lost). Over the last 12 months I haven't lost one page which for me is amazing but because I refer to it all the time I don't seem to loose it. Then when I archive the page in the file I don't have time to transcribe all the undone jobs. I do however rephrase any urgent items as I know that if they are not on my current page list they may get forgotten. This gives an unusual quick focus that doesnt take more than a few minutes. Maybe 2 tasks from 10 undone get added and the rest have to be done during a periodic review. It is haphazard but does work for me. The rephrasing is critical so the new list item is never identical but is re-focused in some way.<br><br>Your question about "new priorities and goals have emerged naturally": Not really, this would be great but in its current form this doesn't really happen. If I am working on a project I can review individual tasks and summarise them easily enough but this is extra work. The AF list doesn't do this. Tracking goals doesn't happen automatically either. There is also a danger of ticking off work but not moving towards a personal goal. Mark maybe your FV will bring us close to a more perfect solution - Keep up the good work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 January 2012 at 13:06 | Tony</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I recently joined a community/ course run by Daniel Vasallo called Small Bets<br>He has an interesting take on productivity.<br>He loves quoting Nassim Taleb...<br>"Procrastination is not a bug, but a feature!"<br><br>So was searching structured procrastination &amp; finally ended up here!<br><br>Guess this was the beginning of Simple Scanning system!<br><br>Mechanically there's nothing much happening, but more I use it, more I benefit from it, I come to appreciate the nuances of getting things done with the least amount of friction!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>19 May 2022 at 10:11 | Sathya</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>This may be entertaining<br>https://mailbrew.com/library/daniel-vassallo/top-tweets-on-procrastination</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>19 May 2022 at 11:46 | Sathya</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
