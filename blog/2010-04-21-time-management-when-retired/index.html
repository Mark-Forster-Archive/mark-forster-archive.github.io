I would take lots of long walks and visit lots of interesting places. I would at last have time to learn a musical instrument, would perfect my French, Spanish and German, and read loads of books.</p>
<p>Some of that’s happened, but the sense of unlimited time available for what I want to do has so far eluded me. In fact I am so busy most of the time I don’t know how I ever fitted full-time, or even part-time, work into my day. I’m not saying this is necessarily a bad thing - just not what I’d envisaged.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that I don’t seem to be able to switch my mind off inventing time management systems. I’m always getting brilliant ideas, and when I get a brilliant idea I want to try it out. And if I’m trying it out then I want to tell other people about it, and discuss it with them and get them to try it out too. So before I know it, I’m doing almost as much work for nothing as I was previously doing for money.</p>
<p>The above is just a preamble to saying that I have now come up with yet another new time management system. It is however very different in the way it works from the Autofocus and DWM systems which I have introduced over the last sixteen months or so. About all it has in common with them is that it uses one long list.</p>
<p>What it does do however is what the Autofocus systems aimed to do, but never quite achieved, which is to autofocus - to zoom in on the things which really matter while not neglecting the mundane but essential tasks which are part of everyone’s lives. So I’ve actually started to get moving with the walks, the music, the languages, the trips and the books. And I may even be able to find time without too much difficultly for that fund raising project which my church seems keen to get me involved in.</p>
<p>How does it work? It’s too early to go into detail, but it is basically a new way of combining some of the time management principles which I have worked on over the years, plus some new ideas.</p>
<p>More soon.</p>
<p>P.S. I almost forgot to say that I think it will work just as well for those who are not retired!</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark,<br><br>being paid or not seems irrelevant when passion is at play...;-)<br><br> Still I would love to hear about your DWM adventure and analysis.<br><br>With kind regards,<br>Ties</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>21 April 2010 at 12:12 | Ties</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark, thanks for confirming what I have heard over and over again from retired friends.

I like this, I definitely could use more balance.<br><br>I've been pondering that the solution to balance is through scheduling.  Setting aside blocks of time.  I haven't followed a schedule since University, and I was more balanced back then.  A schedule can be really nice because it gives me something to look forward to, like regularly doing X activity on X day at X time.<br><br>Maybe there could be some emergent rules for creating a weekly schedule that is responsive to things that might throw it out of whack.  And also responsive to priorities in a simple way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>23 April 2010 at 15:16 | James R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>James R:<br><br>I'm not a great fan of scheduling myself - it just doesn't suit my personal style - but I know that some people get on well with it.<br><br>Two tips:<br><br>1) Leave plenty of unscheduled time for the inevitable upsets to the schedule. I recommend at least 20% should be left unscheduled initially. You can adjust this figure as you gain experience.<br><br>2) Keep a record of how long you thought each task would take v. how long it actually took. That way you can learn to estimate more accurately. Don't try to filter interruptions out of the time taken - they are part of the work environment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>23 April 2010 at 15:38 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>James,<br><br>Have you come across David Seah's work?
