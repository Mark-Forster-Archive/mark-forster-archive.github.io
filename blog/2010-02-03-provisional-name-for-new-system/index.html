That name would clearly stand out in the time managment universe :-) <br><br>On another note, this system is a clear departure from the core concept of DIT. <br>This was obvious from Mark's Feb 1, 15:55 reply in the comments section for the announcement of the system's outlines: <br>-- <br>Avrum:<br>&lt;&lt; How does the new system, in any way, take on the spirit of DIT i.e. Knowing that you've completed a full day of work? &gt;&gt;<br>Does it matter?<br>-- <br>Mark's Jan 31 blog post "Looking For A New Name" also shows this.<br>Therefore I cannot see an 'addendum' to DIT here, and the name probably shouldn't refer to DIT at all. This new system is obviously derived from Autofocus, not from DIT.<br><br>I wouldn't call it "Day/Week/Month"-something either, because I consider the month thingy an unfortunate choice for people in a separated work/home environment. I'd rather opt for 4 weeks to keep the week day in synchronicity and not let work tasks expire on weekends, as I already stated in a useless forum post. The month limit could also prove arbitrary (for some people, 2 or 6 weeks might be more suitable), so it's better to at least leave the 'month' bit out.<br><br>How would I call it? Let's see:<br><br>My initial impressions of the system were rather negative (because I hoped for something much closer to DIT), but after thinking about it for a while, I thought to myself: This could probably best be described as an 'action machine', because it forces you into action, otherwise tasks will expire automatically. And it's a very interesting concept for someone like me who leans towards an electronic implementation (something that AF never was a really good fit for). <br><br>So I would have preferred the name 'Action Machine', but on the one hand, that's already taken by an existing 'productivity' software, and on the other, it completely lacks the 'Autofocus' part. <br><br>In the end, my choice was 'FOCUS MACHINE', because it mixes the Autofocus part with the mechanism that is operated by something, time in this case. And 'FM' makes for a nice abbreviation. <br><br>So here it is: <br>FOCUS MACHINE (FM). <br><br>Sorry for the use of all-caps in some cases, but this comment is too long, and I wanted to point out the most important part.
