If you don’t have this knowledge please don’t bother to read it!</em></p>
<p>One thing that’s becoming increasingly clear to me as I work the new DWM system is that it is not just close to DIT, but actually <em>is</em> DIT.</p>
<p>To see this, let’s examine the statistics which I published in my previous post on February 5th:</p>
<p>Feb 6. 0 (36)</p>
<p>Feb 7. 0 (46)</p>
<p>Feb 8. 0 (50)</p>
<p>Feb 9. 0 (40)</p>
<p>Feb 10. 1 (43)</p>
<p>Feb 11. 16 (62)</p>
<p>Feb 12. 25 (42)</p>
<p>Remember that in DIT you enter all tasks by default under tomorrow’s date with the idea that you take action on them tomorrow. There are however two important exceptions to this. One is that you can enter urgent tasks “below the line” so that they are done today instead of tomorrow. The other is that you can allow yourself to get behind by 4 or 5 days. If you get further behind than that you are supposed to audit your commitments.</p>
<p>If you look more closely at the statistics qyoted above you can see that DWM has kept completely to these principles, except that it has moved the entry point one week into the future. February 12 was where tasks for “tomorrow” were added, and February 11th was today’s list. February 10 consisted of one task which had got behind one day. The 17 tasks shown as already completed on February 12 were the equivalent of DIT’s urgent tasks entered “below the line” today.</p>
<p>Feb 6. 0 (36)</p>
<p>Feb 7. 0 (46)</p>
<p>Feb 8. 0 (50)</p>
<p>Feb 9. 0 (40)</p>
<p>Feb 10. 1 (43) = DIT’s “Behind by 1 day”</p>
<p>Feb 11. 16 (62) = DIT’s “Today”</p>
<p>Feb 12. 25 (42) = DIT’s “Tomorrow”</p>
<p>The only real changes to DIT, apart from the method of entry, are:</p>
<p>1) There is now no need to make a distinction between “same day” tasks and “everything else”.</p>
<p>2) The rather nebulous audit procedure in DIT has been changed into an automatic dismissal process.</p>
<p>I’m sure you will be asking “What about DWM’s 1-month entry point?”</p>
<p>Well, all the 1-month entry point is really doing is adding a pre-screening process to DIT. Instead of relying on the audit to weed out unnecessary tasks, there is now a process by which anything can be added to the list but is weeded out automatically if it no action is taken on it within one month. It also means that anything that gets on the 1-week list has had at least some preliminary action taken on it. There will of course come a time when unactioned 1-month entries co-exist on the same page as new 1-week entry tasks, but there is unlikely to be much confusion between them.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I was under the impression that DIT considered what would be finished on a given day.

So far it's working for me, but I haven't had any tasks show up on it's true date yet.  The 10th will have the first task on it that I haven't actioned yet, so I better get to work if I don't want it dismissed!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>8 February 2010 at 19:33 | Jim (Atlanta)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'm confused now as to what the FIRST entry date for a new task is (in DWM).

Does that entry "Buy New Coffee Maker" go on the March 8th list?

I'm entering all my new and recurring tasks one week from today. I have one week to do or dismiss tasks and have a greater degree of flexibility in choosing when to do them, than DIT allowed.

I work the list electronically and have worked it now for eight days. I am seeing some nice balance. Since I am doing this on my Touch, I see my tasks as a straight list, divided and sorted by "Expiration" date. The top of the list are items that I have started and unfinished (or will need to repeat), but for various reasons am not working as consistently (maybe by necessity) as the items just below this top group. This second group which comprises more than half of my total list and generally extends over two days (six and seven days in the future) are those items that I just started or have consistently worked on since first entered. The bottom part of the list are either the brand new items or those I have not started (and may never start). In AF, the list never changed. DWM seems to be working well because the list is constantly rearranging and moving items to different parts of the list automatically depending on how often we work on it. BTW, I try to work through my list several times a day.<br>I am going to get "Do IT Tomorrow" and see how that helps the system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>8 February 2010 at 23:50 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Will:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Sorry, Mark: I'm not following this.

DIT allowed 5 days grace. DWM allows 7 days grace, but for someone working a 5-day week it's the same.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>9 February 2010 at 0:50 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; The rules of DWM say that things you work on today (5th) move to Feb 12.

All other pages are closed lists (the ones closer than the 1 week mark permanently so) and can only shrink.<br><br>And considering the sixth DIT principle, "reducing random factors", Mark writes on page 30: "it means that we are doing something that we didn't plan to do". In DWM, like in DIT and AF, you write everything down first, and decide whether to do it or not later, when you come back to the task through working the system. You could say by writing it on the list you planned to do it and by actioning it you executed the plan. So it's not exactly a random process.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 February 2010 at 0:22 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Andreas - okay, I concede!

Got many AHA! experiences during the read...<br><br>One thing DIT does better than DWM is that you can easily go back in your daily calendar later on and see what tasks have been planned and checked off during each day. You can also focus better on the present, instead of flipping pages. DIT is so far more logical and easy to understand.<br><br>Well, it's great fun to see the process of developing a new system.
