If I remember correctly, when you wrote 'How to Make Your Dreams Come True', you actually used the 'Dreams' method to write the book, and explained your thought processes and subsequent actions as you went along; it was a fantastic insight, and really 'walked the talk'.  It will be interesting to see whether the Final Version unrolls the same way, though I suspect it might not lend itself so readily to that kind of treatment. This is more exciting than waiting for Christmas!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>26 February 2012 at 10:23 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>If you haven't checked out Apple's ebook authoring application, it may be worth a try. It lets you embed multimedia which could include videos of you working the system or discussing fine points that elaborate on details in the text. <br><br>Of course personally, I'll take *any* format. I'm quite excited to try the new system!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>26 February 2012 at 19:02 | Stever Robbins</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>If you decide to do an electronic version, there's a pretty good free epub creator called sigil ( <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://code.google.com/p/sigil/">http://code.google.com/p/sigil/</a> ) which I've played with and liked. If the online distributors get cranky for their own proprietary formats, calibre ( <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">http://calibre-ebook.com/</a> ) does a decent job converting to other formats. I don't know if calibre will convert copyrighted books nor do I know if sigil will mark an epub as copyrighted.

It spreads copies to all the big distributors like Kindle. I've also heard a few less-good things, mostly about pricing policy, something about if one big company put it on sale (without telling you), it reduces price for all of them.

You have some built in fans on this forum who I am sure would be very willing to tweet and post about it on your behalf. Also there may be opportunities to build reciprocal links which would benefit both parties. I'd certainly be very happy to put a link to you on my website.<br><br>If it is priced sensibly most people will buy a copy just to read about it - it's getting the price point right so you get the best revenue, but it's not a barrier to people who don't know you taking a chance and buying the book.<br><br>I've downloaded some really rubbish ebooks recently (admittedly free - but used as a carrot to buy more) and I am appalled by how useless they are. Why don't people realise that anything you put into the general domain reflects back on you? I certainly wouldn't buy anything from those sources. If they had honed in on a small area as a teaser - and it was really good - then I would have paid to buy the rest.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 February 2012 at 13:49 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I think you will end up with the most income from the book if it becomes available on all the major reading *devices* –&nbsp;Apple iPad, iPod, iPhone; Amazon Kindle; Barnes&amp;Noble Nook –&nbsp;and is easy to download from the corresponding online stores in multiple countries.  I don't know anything about publishing, but this approach probably means working first with a major publisher, who will take a cut, as will Apple and Amazon and BN. But the latter two would probably make paperback "dead tree" versions available for purchase a well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 February 2012 at 20:08 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>&lt;&lt; At this point I would be willing to pay to read FV described in scribbles <br>     on the back of a napkin. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Me too...<br>me too...<br>me too...<br><br>Desperate Karl</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 March 2012 at 9:22 | Theo</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>&lt;&lt;Any thoughts on how Final Version might work in conjunction with GTD?
