I’ve found one method to be particularly useful, and so I’m going to describe how it works in this post.</p>
<p>But first a few words of caution:</p>
<p>1) Just because I’ve published a new method, doesn’t mean that you have to try it out.</p>
<p>2) It doesn’t invalidate any of the methods I’ve previously described.</p>
<p>3) I’m not claiming that this is the best method for anybody, let alone everybody.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I’m finding that it has several unique qualities:</p>
<p>1) It is strongly weighted towards the beginning of the list, which is where the most difficult stuff tends to gather. The result is that one feels that one is really achieving something, rather than just processing trivia.</p>
<p>2) It prevents the phenomenon of “chasing the end of the list”.</p>
<p>3) It is simple and fun to operate.</p>
<p>4) It can cope with a large amount of work. In fact the bigger the list, the better it works.</p>
<p>The rules are very easy. You start with a list of tasks. This can be as short or as long as you like. Add new stuff as you go along.</p>
<p>Select one task out of the entire list. Do it. When you’ve finished working on it, cross it out with a long line which extends into the margin.</p>
<p>Unless the task you chose was the first task or the last task, the list is now divided into two unequal halves (or possibly equal halves if you chose the exact centre task). Do one task out of each half. The list is now divided into four unequal quarters.</p>
<p>Continue in this way. Each time the list is divided further and further.</p>
<p>Because you will be continuously adding new tasks or re-entering old tasks, the end of the list will tend to contain longer divisions than the beginning of the list.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email<br>Voicemail<br>Paper<br>Blog<br>Tidy<br>Check Diary<br>Post Letters<br>Facebook</p>
<p>You decide to do the task “Check Diary”. You re-enter it as it’s a recurring task and at the same time a couple of new tasks get added.</p>
<p>Email<br>Voicemail<br>Paper<br>Blog<br>Tidy<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Check Diary</span><br>Post Letters<br>Facebook<br>Check Diary<br>Call Bill<br>Buy Present for Beloved</p>
<p>You now have two sections divided by the crossing out of Check Diary. Chose one task from each section and do it.</p>
<p>Email<br>Voicemail<br>Paper<br>Blog<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Tidy</span><br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Check Diary</span><br>Post Letters<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Facebook</span><br>Check Diary<br>Call Bill<br>Buy Present for Beloved<br>Tidy <br>Project X<br>Check Diary<br>Draft Report<br>Clean Car<br>Facebook</p>
<p>You now have three sections (it would have been four if you had not chosen a task next to the one already done). Do a task from each section. The second section consists of only one task “Post Letters” so you have to do that one.</p>

Obviously, the longer your list, the more sections you will have.<br><br>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/426952/sections-vs-opentasks.png<br><br>This is an sample list for somebody with 32 open tasks (and 7 sections):<br><br>     0<br>     done<br>     done<br>     done<br>     done<br>     done<br>     done<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     done<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     done<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     done<br>     0<br>     done<br>     0<br>     done<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br>     0<br><br>As you can see, and as Mark already mentioned, the sections gravitate toward the beginning of the list, forcing you to to do most of your tasks at the beginning of the list.<br><br>I still wonder... if like Mark, you have a list of roughly 60 open tasks with the corresponding 15 or so sections, it will take quite a while to go through one cycle of your list, won't it?

I think once one starts skipping sections the main point of the method is in danger of getting lost (but see my third point below).<br><br>2) Your random simulation has produced the following distribution of tasks: 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 18. You can compare that with my 17 sections, containing the following tasks: 1, 2 ,1, 2, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 8, 7, 1, 7, 1, 8, 27, 12. A total of 88 open tasks, if I've added them up correctly.<br><br>3) One amendment to the rules I have considered is that a section containing a singleton should be combined with the next section. This would mean that there would always be a choice of tasks. It would also have the advantage of cutting the number of sections. So my 17 sections would be combined as follows: 3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 8, 7, 8, 9, 27, 12. That's reduced it to only 11 sections. Yours would be done 4, 4, 4, 2, 18 reducing your seven sections to five.<br><br>There would be no need to physically combine the sections; you would just need to remember that when you came to a singleton you should select from it plus the next section.<br><br>So far I haven't found it necessary to use this amendment, but if I start getting bogged down I will try it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>21 May 2013 at 10:40 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>My 20 open sections at the beginning of today have now reduced to 15, which have tasks as follows:<br>1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4, 6, 1, 6, 15, 11, 28.

I'll be honest, I didn't expect to like this new idea. I was really afraid of urgent tasks being left undone. After just a single day of use, I'm a convert! I really like having many small lists come up throughout the day, as well as the ability to (somewhat) control just how many sections there are. Just like every other system you've discussed, my biggest hurdle is to keep reminding myself that it's not just okay, but encouraged to dismiss tasks regularly until such time as they can actually be tackled.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>21 May 2013 at 22:50 | UMOarsman</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'll admit that I have a vice of checking this site every now and then... hopeful that Mark will post a new idea.

I would like to second Marco's question - could you share your ideas in using a planner (like a 2 page/day) along with this new method that you have just shared?  I find a planner (paper) is very helpful for me but that the energy and motivation of working with a task list is missing.  Would appreciate your insights. If this has been discussed elsewhere, I would appreciate being pointed that way.  Thanks.

The actions of partitioning sections actually reduces choices, which is a good thing in many ways I think. You are forced to choose amongst an ever diminishing number of tasks in greater sections, which reduces the overhead of having to scan the entire list before a suitable chain is chosen in FV.  Here, you just jump over a section, choose a task from a small list and do it. <br><br>2. I find that tasks with finer granularity tend to do better and so agree with Mark's point on that. Actually, I've found myself naturally evolving to this, rather than listing projects on my list, even with the other systems.  That's because I find myself losing the feel of a project's urgency this way. I don't mind putting things like "what's the next step" or "review file to check status" if I want to move it along. But otherwise, I find it more effective to just write the various steps in a project as far as possible. <br><br>3. Most of Mark's systems are easy to implement electronically, and this is no exception. I can't explain, however, why I've never been successful at a solid system that I stick with, be it Evernote, or even Mindmanager for task management.  I plan projects, conduct research, outline my case files all very well using software, but when it comes the actual doing of a task, nothing has worked better than pen and paper. I guess it's the speed of reaction to changing circumstances that make  analogue systems work better for me. <br><br>Thank you Mark for sharing your new experiment. I think I like it better than FV for its quicker reaction time and shorter sectioned lists.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 May 2013 at 14:52 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi folks<br><br>Why not just do one task from every page?<br><br>Get lots done<br><br>Karl</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>25 May 2013 at 16:57 | Karl</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Karl:<br><br>Have you tried both?

I spent about 10 hours with it yesterday.  I admit that I got a lot done.  The list grows organically.   However, today, I notice that the tasks that I have to choose from are in different places in my home.  As the list gets longer, and the task are short, I would need to sit down, stand up, walk, go to the computer, go to the bedroom, go to the desk, go to the living room, etc.  This switching from place to place is getting a little wearisome.  This morning I chose from the tasks that I could do at my desk, then at my computer. Any solutions to this?  Perhaps this method might be a good alternative as a change of pace.

The advantage of this is that everything gets done eventually if you stick to it. The disadvantages are that it's completely inflexible, makes no allowance for urgency at all, and one's mind may rebel against never having any choice about what to do next.<br><br>In the LIFO list you do whatever happens to be the last item on the list. The advantage is that a lot of tasks get done very quickly. The disadvantage is that a lot of tasks never get done at all.<br><br>All systems using a full list are trying to achieve the best possible balance between these two extremes. If the list is weighted too far towards FIFO it is too inflexible. If it's weighted too far towards LIFO then one is processing too much trivia at the expense of the weighty stuff.<br><br>The system proposed here allows a fair amount of flexibility and gives a choice of task most of the time. But as I've said above it won't deal well with really urgent stuff, which is best dealt with out of the system under the "if it needs to be done now, do it now" rule which applies to all time management systems.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>26 May 2013 at 11:06 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Wondering if you start the sectioning of the list anew everyday, or do you stick with the sections day to day?

It's necessary to temporarily stop working the sections and work the urgent matters that come your way. FV is more accommodating that way, as well as more able to cope with bigger tasks at say, the project level as opposed to individual tasks. <br><br>As an example to illustrate my own experience, today while working on my sections, something urgent came up which required me to evaluate the whole case file to brief my boss. As part of that briefing, I had to complete some smaller tasks which I had previously entered in my main task list. This of course threw my neat sections out of whack. <br><br>FV would have dealt with it quite nicely. A task called "prepare for briefing"  entered at the end as part of the current chain, and worked on after completing the task at hand. Any smaller tasks inadvertently done by that task would simply be crossed out at the next chain selection process or when weeding the list. <br><br>So, I think FV has its own unique strengths that's probably more suited for my kind of work. It was great to discover this by working the system because I end up trusting my choice even more knowing why it works for me so well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>27 May 2013 at 16:55 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark, I am intrigued by this comment of yours from about a week ago:<br><br>&lt;&lt;I've also found that the system works best when large tasks are split down as small as possible. For instance I cleared a paper backlog in record time by entering each individual piece of paper as a task.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Can you elaborate on how you did this? If you had 43 pieces of paper, did you enter 43 tasks as separate lines onto the list in one shot, or did you keep entering the next five at a time ... did you write them in a descriptive way for each paper (requiring you to inspect the papers as you wrote them), or did you write generically "next piece of paper"? And so on.<br><br>I ask because I haven't had much luck breaking things down like this. I tend to do it in ways that bog down the list or become irrelevant quickly.
