Most of the comments I have had have been from people who like the new arrangement, but obviously no change is going to please everyone.<br><br>The idea of the diary is to show the DIT system in action - which is I think one way of helping you to understand the book better. The reason it's boring is because I am concentrating on describing how the system works rather than the amazing and salacious details of my colourful life.<br><br>The blog entry you are commenting on is announcing a series of articles which will have the precise intention of helping people to understand one of my less understood books better.<br><br>As for advertisements - well, this site is a commercial one and has never pretended to be otherwise.<br><br>Although I appreciate that some people, such as yourself, don't like the extra volume, the fact is that the number of daily hits on this website has risen by over six times since the beginning of this month.<br><br>What I suggest you do is make a note to come back to the site once a month or so and look at the "Most Popular articles" section in the sidebar for anything which you haven't seen before.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>28 February 2008 at 10:25 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>P.S.<br>One way I've thought of to help people in your situation is to introduce a new category "Articles" which will be reserved for proper articles.

I find it your most intriguing book. However, when I try to follow the ideas I worry I'm missing details so turn to a more detailed system such as DIT to keep track of everything. But then I start to feel I'm not really moving toward my dreams, just managing minutiae. I've yet to find a happy medium between the two - doing them both feels like a lot of extra effort and far from the flowing promise of 'Dreams'.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>6 April 2008 at 19:20 | Matt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Matt:<br><br>The great advantage of "Do It Tomorrow" is that it keeps you on top of your work. This gives you energy and renewed enthusiasm to achieve your goals. It also gives you a method of telling when you are taking on too much.<br><br>Usually the feeling that you are managing minutiae comes from not being selective enough about what you feed into the DIT system. As I say on the Home page of this website "Don't get caught in the activity trap!"<br><br>The sure sign that you have taken on too much busy work is that you feel overwhelmed but not challenged by your work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>10 April 2008 at 12:09 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark,<br><br>Makes sense. I'm going to revisit the vision creation exercises from Dreams to provide the context for what I keep and cull from the will do list when I find myself getting behind. Hopefully that will give me the feeling of pushing in the right direction.<br><br>Hope your back feels better soon.<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 April 2008 at 16:56 | Matt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Thanks, Matt, I am feeling much better now - though still not 100 per cent.<br><br>Keep us posted on how you get on with the vision!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>15 April 2008 at 8:35 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I started the "How to Make Your Dreams.." book and made it to page 30, then it went on the stack of incomplete reads. I'm wondering if I've missed something though, because I've read some positive reviews. What is the gist of what this book is about? I just had a hard time understanding what the intent is.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>27 April 2008 at 0:04 | Mark in Texas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I suggest you look at the summary on p. 193.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>27 April 2008 at 13:48 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I have found that this book is one I come back to every now and then as a way to focus what I am aiming for. The idea of having a clear vision of where you want to be seems to work well over time - and comparing your present situation to that vision to see what needs to change can also be helpful in ensuring your goals/projects are actually going to get you where you want to be. <br><br>It is also helpful in making sure you trim back those committments that don't move you in the right direction, however worthwhile they may seem in and of themselves - there are only 24 hours in the day and you can only do so much!<br><br>The dialoguing is something I have only recently started to use in earnest having seen it also mentioned elsewhere. My method is maybe just a little different but probably in the same vein (Mark, correct me if I'm wrong here!). I think of something I want to achieve then one of the 'voices' takes the form of an interiewer asking the future self (voice 2) how I managed to achieve the particular goal. The first time I tried it I was amazed at what I came up with - I was writing in a journal type situation. It seems to reveal insights into how you can go about achieving goals and projects that somehow ordinary thinking doesn't seem to produce.<br><br>I don't know if any of this sheds any light on the 'Dreams' book and sometimes you have to be in the right frame of mind to get the most from some books, but I hope my experiences help to explain it in some way.<br><br>Good luck</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>27 April 2008 at 17:58 | Hannah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>PS I guess I should also say that I use it as a supplement to the other Mark Forster books. The others seem to be more about the nitty gritty of day to day time/self management whereas 'Dreams' is to me more of an aid to creating and keeping focused on where you're going - your overall vision for yourself and your life.<br><br>You can be the most organised and efficient person on the planet but if you haven't worked out where you want to be headed you won't be very effective and it won't do you much good, nor make you very happy with life!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>27 April 2008 at 18:06 | Hannah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>A tactic I came across called 10-10-10 asks you to consider any decision about which path to follow from the points of view of how would this decision seem in 10 days 10 weeks and 10 months, or, I suppose, 10 years.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>18 September 2010 at 20:59 | MC</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
