<p>A few weeks ago I said that I was intending to have another go at the <a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&amp;categoryId=90409">Resistance Principle</a>. How have I been getting on with it? Well, the truth is that I found it exactly the same as in my previous attempts. After an initial period of success, my mind started to rebel against it and I&nbsp;found myself most&nbsp;days&nbsp;achieving only trivial tasks - and sometimes not even those.</p><p>However I then changed tack a bit. Instead of asking myself “What am I resisting (now this moment)?”, I changed the question to “What am I resisting the most (overall in my life)?” To be able to answer this question satisfactorily, I found it necessary to work off a task list. By marking the resistance I felt to each item on the list out of 100, I ended up with an ordered list of things to be done.</p><p>This worked brilliantly in getting some major outstanding projects completed. However the problem with this sort of approach&nbsp;is: “When do the low resistance items get done?” If writing an email to a friend has to wait until I’ve cleared all the items I’m resisting, my friend isn’t going to get many emails from me!</p><p>So what I am trying out now is an adaption of Colley’s Rule. For those of you who haven’t come across Colley’s Rule before, it is a method designed by a 19th Century mathematician for making decisions. It&nbsp;enables one&nbsp;to&nbsp;come up with a high quality of decision without&nbsp;all the stress of trying to find the “best decision”. According to the rule you draw up the specification for what you want, i.e. a four bedroom house within two miles of the nearest primary school, etc. and then take the first house you are offered as a benchmark. You do not buy this house, but instead buy the next house you are offered which is <em>better</em> than the first one. This has been shown mathematically to produce a very high quality of result. </p><p>You can&nbsp;apply Colley’s rule to all sorts of decisions. I’ve used it myself for such things as&nbsp;chosing a&nbsp;restaurant in a strange town, or deciding what to do on my day off. How can I apply it to the list of items I am resisting?</p><p>Well, in this case what I am doing to apply the Rule is to take the top item on my list as the benchmark, and move down the list until I come to a task which I am resisting more than the top item. Once I’ve completed that I take the <em>next</em> item on my list as the benchmark and move down the list until I come to a task which I am resisting more than the new benchmark. I continue working my way round the list using the same principle.</p><p>I find that this works very well. It ensures that all the high resistance items get done, while giving a chance for lower resistance items to get cleared too. As items tend to rise in resistance the longer one leaves them, there is a natural balance built into it. Using this method one can reduce the average resistance of one’s&nbsp;to do list very quickly. The lower the average resistance is, the quicker you can get through the tasks on the list.</p><p>As always, I want to stress that I am trying this out, not recommending it. That will come later - if it works for me!</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I tried this, and found it worked well. I have a question though, I completed one item on the list, then went to use the next as a benchmark, the next being going for a run which I am resisting at the moment because I am supposed to be training for a marathon, it was marked 80/100 resistance, but there were no other higher items on my list, what do I do then?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>5 February 2007 at 19:10 | Wendy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I am going to answer my own question now. I did just skip to the next task and use it as a benchmark, but I suppose you could start at the top of the list again. Regardless, I now am going to have to go for a run because it is the next highest resistance item on my list!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>5 February 2007 at 20:08 | Wendy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi, Wendy<br><br>My answer is that if I haven't found a higher resistance task by the time I get back to the item, then I do the item itself. <br><br>Mark</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>5 February 2007 at 22:56 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Interesting related article at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://kevinchiu.org/kevin_chiu_procrastination.pdf.">http://kevinchiu.org/kevin_chiu_procrastination.pdf.</a> The author suggests incrementally increasing diffculty in a batch of tasks helps build a flow state.

My own experience has been that working from most to least resistance produces the best results, but I would be interested to know what your findings are if you work from least to most.<br>Mark</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>12 February 2007 at 18:11 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark,<br><br>I've only been trying an easiest first approach for a couple of days so I can't really tell yet what difference it will make. <br>My first impression is that getting into the day's work is easy and gives an early feeling of being productive. I'm going to play with it for a few more days to see if I fade as I get to the harder tasks or whether the early momentum remains.<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 February 2007 at 9:40 | Matt Gregory</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi, Matt<br><br>I've certainly found an easiest first approach can work well provided one is working off a closed list and has enough time to finish it.<br><br>Otherwise I have always found that the most difficult items just end up getting carried forward from day to day.<br><br>I'll be very interested to hear what you come up during your trial.<br><br>Mark</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 February 2007 at 12:09 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark,<br><br>As you suspected, starting with the easiest didn't work for me, at least not across a whole day. <br>I found starting small with a batch of uninterrupted tasks does allow a certain monentum to develop, but there's no way to remain uninterrupted across a whole day. The end result is, of course, to have the toughest tasks facing me at the end of the day while having lost momentum through interruptions.<br>If I could have large chunks of the day uninterrupted, say 2 or 3 hours, I think it might have some productivity value to create batches that ease me in to each uninterrupted period. However, that's a lot of organisational overhead and not particularly practical for me right now.<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>19 February 2007 at 16:32 | Matt Gregory</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
