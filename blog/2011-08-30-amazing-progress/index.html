Today I succeeded in shifting the most enormous work load while experiencing absolutely no resistance.</p>
<p>Getting the basic stuff under control goes without question. There’s not been the slightest doubt that my email, paper and phone calls would remain cleared all day, that my office would remain tidy, that the household chores would be done right on time, that comments on this website wouldl be read and answered. That’s just the light relief.</p>
<p>What is hugely more impressive is the progress that I’ve made on more serious projects. Things are really beginning to move, although it’s early days yet on most of them.</p>
<p>In spite of this, the system is running too fast at the moment because the workload isn’t heavy enough. One of the great advantages of the Final Version is that you can precisely balance your workload to the system. It does this in a much more sophisticated way than <em>Do It Tomorrow</em> did. This is a bit of a new experience for me - I haven’t had a time management system before which tells me that I’m not giving it enough work!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’m away for most of the day on a visit to the Houses of Parliament so I’ll be interested to see how the system deals with a very short work time.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>+JMJ+<br><br>Seems very promising Mark!<br><br>Can the Final Version be used in a small notebook like my 3x5 fliptop?

You're not obliged in any manner to follow his evolution.<br><br>Different things work for different people. I know that most systems - by Mark, or David Allen, or whoever - that I have tried worked for some weeks and then the magic worn off (sometimes because they worked too well and I was left with nothing to do, and the system got useless when I finally could play videogames without feeling guilty) I was not looking for something that suited ME, but just a magic wand.<br><br>If you wait for Mark to find the perfect fit solution for you, you'll be disappointed.<br><br>Yet, I like reading about Mark's ideas.

I say that because AF1 for me was such a positive revolution in the way I did my work.  I think Mark has a particular genius that is rare and quite original.  His approach to time management has been genuinely helpful, (although of course not always perfect) and I think many others find this as well.  <br><br>One point further, Mark's originality and creativity tends to inspire creativity and originality in others as well,  Hence this rather prolific and interesting forum.
