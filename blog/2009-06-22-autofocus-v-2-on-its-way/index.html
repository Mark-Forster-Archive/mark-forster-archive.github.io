In this case what happened was that, as soon as I started using Autofocus again, I suddenly realised what was missing from my attempts to produce a revised system.<br><br>As a result I am now putting the final touches to the revised system and intend to release it later this week.<br><br>What I’ve been aiming to achieve in the improved version are the following:<br><br>1. Easier handling of urgent and must do items.<br><br>2. A more balanced approach to the day as a whole.<br><br>3. Quicker handling of large or difficult items.<br><br>4. Eliminating the tendency for the list to slow to a crawl.<br><br>5. Faster sifting of unwanted items.<br><br>6. Dismissal less of a hit-and-miss process.<br><br>7. Less need to use subsidiary lists.<br><br>8. Removing the need for most of the ‘tweaks’ which people have reported in the Forum and elsewhere.<br><br>By and large I think I have succeeded.<br><br>One of the features of the new system is that it uses exactly the same type of list as before. So there is no need to re-write your Autofocus list in order to switch to it. The same applies if you don’t like the new system and want to revert to the old one. In spite of this I expect most people will want to start from scratch with the new system.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Awaiting eagerly for the new version ;)<br><br>I've adopted your system of "do it tomorrow" very successfully at workplace, but for personal matters "autofocus" seems to work better.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2009 at 7:24 | Tamagochi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Yay Mark, looking forward to the release!<br><br>Although I'm not sure if I like the last sentence about starting from scratch: that used to be the one motivation for me to switch systems, so I could spend more time tweaking without getting any work done :-)).

One thing that I loved about DIT was that I had a clear view of how full my day was and could use it as a tool to help buffer and keep at bay emerging so-called urgent requests. If there's anyway of considering that as part of your new system that would be welcomed.<br><br>Nicole, I'd urge you to see it as a reboot of your system rather than a switch. Having In May started a new list after reaching a fragmented 100 activites spread over 35 pages it really helped get back to basics.<br><br>Best regards.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2009 at 8:33 | Jonathan in London</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Jonathan:<br><br>What I've found myself with AF v. 2 is that it is very good at giving shape to my day and making best use of the time available. Unlike AF v. 1 all the tasks on the list are potentially available for action at any time. So it improves the handling of both genuinely urgent and non-urgent stuff. In the way it works it's much more like AF than DIT though.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2009 at 8:58 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark, the list of functions/features/capabilities (whatever) looks very good.  I think many of us will be pleased with getting just four of the eight.<br><br>"Giving shape to the day" sounds intriguing and potentially hopeful for the likes of me.<br><br>I look forward to v2 being released, ideally by Thursday as I am due to spend about 7 hours at Cairo International Airport waiting for the 04h00 KLM flight out of there..<br><br>Jonathan in London comment about rebooting: that's a very good way of describing it</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2009 at 9:28 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I'm looking forward to it too, Mark.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2009 at 9:51 | Virginia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Wow...

I.e. all the big projects I could think of were put in first then the smaller ones and then smaller as I dumped at  a finer level of granularity.<br><br>Since the first pages were mainly large projects, it quickly reached the point where I hit the dismissal rule on a page of projects.  I realize I could start one, or label them as "potentials if the resources are available" to avoid outright dismissal of the backlog, but i was caused by the clustering effect of a minddump.<br><br>You probably started your new variant with a working list that did not have these attributes and I was wondering if  you or others had thoughts on how to overcome the resistance that this clustering can generate. Does AF 2.1 address this any better?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2009 at 13:18 | Roger D</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I had been previously put off by Autofocus for the very reasons that Mark has described as improvements to his new system.<br><br>So I am now eagerly looking forward to it; I will be more than happy to start from scratch!<br><br>There's just one thing Mark... I go on holiday on Thursday morning so any chance of the new system instructions before then so I have some reading material while I'm away?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2009 at 13:28 | Jason</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark,<br>Wonderful news.

Maybe it's an added incentive to close as much off as possible before I go.<br><br>Jason, I'm going on holiday too and am hoping the instructions come out when I'm gone so that when I come back full of energy, I can dive into a new system!  I'd be too afraid I'd build a huge list that I can't work on while I'm on holiday... :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2009 at 14:13 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Jonathan, thanks for the hint about "rebooting," that's indeed a much more effective description.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2009 at 14:36 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Could have used it on a Monday morning...&lt;wink&gt;...but will be delighted to read about it whenever you gift us with it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>22 June 2009 at 15:16 | Ruth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Great Mark, looking forward to it!
