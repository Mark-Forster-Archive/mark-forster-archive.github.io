<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.simplymoleskine.com/product/QP060/Moleskine%C2%AE-Large-Ruled-Notebook"><em>Moleskine Notebook</em></a>. I much prefer using pen and paper for time management lists, and it’s important to me how the notebook feels. The standard Moleskine ruled notebook with 31 lines to a page is just the right size and durable enough to be carried around with me. I like the paper quality too.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Papermate-Comfortmate-Fresh-Retractable-Ballpen/dp/B000SHQV0I/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1296497141&amp;sr=1-3"><em>Papermate Comfortmate Ball Pen</em></a>. The most comfortable, reliable and indestructible of cheapo pens, and of many a lot more expensive too.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.timetimer.com/"><em>Time Timer</em></a>. I use this visual countdown timer all the time for seeing how long I’ve got before I’ve got to do something. It’s also great for keeping track of the time during presentations, and for showing a group of people how long they’ve got for a task.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kitchen-Countdown-Timer-minutes-display/dp/B0039V7ZC8/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1296497497&amp;sr=1-13"><em>Kitchen Timer</em></a>. When a visual timer isn’t appropriate I use an ordinary electronic kitchen timer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ryman.co.uk/0105050701/Ryman-Colour-Lever-Arch-File-Foolscap/Product"><em>Lever Arch File</em>s</a>. I find these the most useful form of filing. They also have the advantage that they will stand upright on a shelf. Unfortunately they don’t seem to be easily come by in the States.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.caelo.com/"><em>NEO Email Organizer</em></a>. I don’t think I could survive without this program, which makes it possible to handle easily even vast quantities of email. I’ve been using this for years, and have found it invaluable. It only works with MS Outlook though.</li>
</ul>

Hopefully others will share their favourites!<br><br>I am a big fan of Filofax because they look great and you can re-organise your pages easily. I've had problems with syncing my phone etc so this year I am carrying a small diary in my bag - it's quite liberating to get back to pen and paper for this and I can easily see all my commitments, wheras on my phone I could only see a daily view.<br><br>I also love the Pilot Frixion Erasable Rollerball pen - yes you can erase it with the friction pad at the end of the pen!  Great for if you want to make changes. You can get them in several different colours from Cult Pens - no affiliation - but they do seem to deliver very quickly.<br><br>I use most of the other items you mention, but haven't tried the email organiser - I may have to take a look at that!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 February 2011 at 8:52 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Thanks, Alison.

I can't agree. I use random corporate giveaways and most of those are better than Bic!

They don't have a separate cap which either gets lost or comes off when the pen is clipped in the pocket.<br><br>2. They are not made of hard brittle plastic which breaks if you tread on them by mistake (or sometimes even if you don't).<br><br>3. They don't have an unreliable ink flow which frequently gives up long before the pen is empty.<br><br>4. They don't have an uneven ink flow which often results in smudges on the page.<br><br>Disadvantages of Papermates compared with Bics<br><br>1. They are a bit more expensive, but still incredibly cheap<br><br>2. You can't see how much ink is left (though see 3 above)<br><br>Out of the pack of 12 Papermates I bought in August last year (£5.80), I still have ten left. However the missing two have been mislaid - I haven't yet had one run out of ink.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 February 2011 at 12:00 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>In an ideal world I favour fountain pens, and have Mont Blanc (special presents only as very expensive) or at the other end of the scale you can't beat a Lamy Safari fountain pen - you can even choose your nib (I prefer an oblique). <br><br>However there are lots of times when a fountain pen is not suitable - I have one or two 'nice' biros for desk use (I mostly work from home), but tend to use cheap and cheerful ones when out and about - it's amazing how they go missing!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 February 2011 at 12:44 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I have a montblanc too a fountain pen which is new and beautifull.

It is fully customizable with different types of papers, dividers, and pockets you can buy.  And the pen holder can easily accommodate anything from a slim ballpoint pen to my thick Lamy Safari.  <br><br>It is the most perfect notebook organizer I have ever seen and used.<br><br>Now if only the store would offer a punch....<br><br>God bless!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 February 2011 at 13:25 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>nuntym:<br><br>Unfortunately when I followed the link you gave, it asked me for a zip code (which I don't have) before it would let me on the site.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 February 2011 at 15:50 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>@Mark, <br><br>I just check Staples UK, they are not carrying the M Arc line =/<br><br>Oh well, the Staples US do not carry lever arch files (which I am very interested in) so I guess that's a (sorta) fair trade-off...<br><br>Anyways, just place a 5-digit number and I guess that'll take care of the zip-code thing.<br><br>God bless!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 February 2011 at 18:29 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I have to give a plug for the Zebra SARASA gel pen in 0.7 size. (The 0.5 is a little scratchy.) Nice looking, comfortable, flows nicely, beautiful DARK lines and letters are the output. I keep track of time by filling in bubbles and sometimes doodle with solid colors and this ink lets me saturate the surface, like paint.<br><br>I get annoyed by inconsistent pens so when I find a different one I throw it out. I keep a box of sarasa around.<br><br>They do run out of ink quickly though.

(Yes, there are notebooks that already come with pen loops, but I never found one with paper to my liking.)<br><br>The one I found is from a German brand ("Leuchtturm 1917"), and I bought in in a brick-and-mortar store for EUR 2,50, but you can find it at Amazon as well: <br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.de/PENLOOP-Stift-Schlaufe-PenLoop-scharz-LEUCHTTURM1917/dp/B002CWMAPW">http://www.amazon.de/PENLOOP-Stift-Schlaufe-PenLoop-scharz-LEUCHTTURM1917/dp/B002CWMAPW</a> <br><br>Don't know whether there are these ore similar ones sold outside Germany, though.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 February 2011 at 22:55 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>A UK alternative to the disc bound books is one made by snopake:  <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://shop.snopake.com/product.asp?s=qtsnd4333027&amp;strParents=&amp;CAT_ID=100&amp;P_ID=695">http://shop.snopake.com/product.asp?s=qtsnd4333027&amp;strParents=&amp;CAT_ID=100&amp;P_ID=695</a> <br><br>I haven't used it yet - I've tried to buy one before, but the snopake site seems to be the only place I can find online at the moment.

I find the grip much better but i am accustomed to the cristal bic and for the moment i find the writing more difficult. But it may change when they will be really used.
