I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised as one of my contentions has been that it’s the psychological attitude that counts as much as the system itself.</p>
<p>Simple scanning does have two major disadvantages though:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The list tends to grow uncontrollably</li>
<li>It gets spread over a large number of pages if one’s using a notebook and pencil/pen.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>So over the last week I’ve been working on how I could improve these aspects of simple scanning. I think I’ve succeeded - though it needs some further testing.</p>
<p>Here are the stats for the short period (4.5 days) I’ve been using it. I started a new list for the test wth 31 tasks to the page.</p>
<p>The first column shows the page, the second the number of tasks remaining as of this moment:</p>
<p>1 - 0</p>
<p>2 - 0</p>
<p>3 - 0</p>
<p>4 - 0</p>
<p>5 - 0</p>
<p>6 - 0</p>
<p>7 - 0</p>
<p>8 - 0</p>
<p>9 - 4</p>
<p>10 - 15</p>
<p>11 - 21</p>
<p>12 - 2 (of 2)</p>
<p>So in 4.5 days I have actioned 343 tasks, with 42 remaining.</p>
<p>More details soon!</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Can't wait...<br>Now I thought I was a busy/productive person until I saw you got through 343 tasks to do in a few days!<br>Amazing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>13 July 2017 at 17:24 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>MrBacklog:<br><br>The number of tasks isn't really the crucial thing.

Paradoxically the best way to push through what you've taken on is to avoid forcing yourself to work on a specific task or for a specific length of time. That way you neither experience resistance to the task you are doing nor to the tasks you are not doing.<br><br>&lt;&lt; Cal Newport's Deep Work emphasis on periods of long uninterrupted concentration &gt;&gt;<br><br>These will still occur. It's just that they won't be scheduled.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 July 2017 at 12:45 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>&lt;&lt; I wonder if the saying "a bad workman always blames his tools", is something to carefully consider before thinking it is the system that is not working... &gt;&gt;<br><br>Much as I don't like it, that fits my experience. There are better and worse tools, and some tools will fit an individual, or job, or season, or combination of the above, better than other tools, but eventually it comes down to using them.<br><br>Now that I finally experimented with tiny goals, a quick touch of each project most days (a tiny bit more than opening and immediately closing the folder), I've found that most projects can be broken up, even ones I hadn't expected. Those tiny touches keep momentum going. For the rare bits that do need a longer session (still shorter than before I tried asking "how short and still useful?") I have less resistance. The momentum is there, and I know better what to expect. Much nicer than, "An afternoon or five, maybe more, dealing with that mess in the folder."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 July 2017 at 20:28 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>@Cricket: This matches my own experience. The "tiny bit" is the "at least one minute of work or thinking about the best next action" in my system, which can result in just reprasing the item and reentering it at the end of the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>16 July 2017 at 9:34 | Nordwind</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>@Nordwind: That's even smaller than my tiny bit. I wonder if "Gently think about why I'm resisting and what my actual goals are?" might work for me. In hindsight, I'm more likely to ask "Why do I have to do it that way, or at all?" when relaxing than when working.<br><br>Another important part for me is not creating a mess while doing the work. Take one thing from the pile, and put it in its new home. If that new home is full, take one thing, put the first thing away, and take the new thing to its new home. Very different from pull everything out of your closet, put it on the floor, take three things to their new homes, and get distracted. Dana White, of A Slob Comes Clean, describes this very well in her book How to Manage Your Home Without Losing Your Mind. I find some types of projects are easier to convert to this method than others, but I'm finding it worth the challenge.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>17 July 2017 at 1:04 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>@Cricket: That is a good question. My method consists of two modes: "urgency mode" (skimming backwards and working on items that should be acted on within the next hour) and "top down mode" (work on the first unactioned item for as long as I want to, but for at least one minute, before crossing it off and reentering it at the end of the list (sometimes rephrases or as the next action for that particular project). Only items that can't be worked on right now (wrong place, wrong time) may be skipped.<br><br>When I work in "top down mode" every item has to be worked on (except the above mentioned skipping rule). If I feel resistance / procrastination, I think about why this item is on the list at all, if there are other/better ways to get the same result, if the item should be transferred to my "trigger list" for later, or how I can rephrase it to get a grip on it and reduce my inner resistance against it. This works so good that usually I no longer feel any resistance to tackle this item on the next pass.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>17 July 2017 at 10:58 | Nordwind</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>'These will still occur.
