One Month On</h1> <span class="date" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>8 February 2007 at 16:00</span> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt><p>In a <a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&amp;currentPage=3&amp;categoryId=75905">previous entry</a>&nbsp;when I had been doing my new diet for just over a month (January 5th)&nbsp;I summed up how hard it had been. Now that I’ve been doing it for just over another month I thought it would be good to analyse how hard it had been again for comparison purpose. As of today, I have lost 10 lbs and have four rules in place: No Seconds; No Snacking; No Sweets and Small Portions.</p><p>I’m still finding it easy to keep to, in spite of the fact that I’m getting to the stage where in most diets one tends to plateau. As you’ll see below there is some evidence of that happening, but not so much as to pose problems.</p><blockquote><p>So in the 34 days since the previous report:</p><ul><li><div>On&nbsp;4 days I have had no rules in place at all; so I have been able to eat exactly what I like, when I like, in what quantities I like. </div></li><li><div>On&nbsp;30 days I haven’t been allowed second helpings.</div></li><li><div>On 23 days I also haven’t been allowed to eat more than 3 meals a day.</div></li><li><div>On&nbsp;14 days I also haven’t been allowed to eat anything sweet.</div></li><li><div>On&nbsp;7 days I’ve also had to eat small portions</div></li><li><div>On 1 day I also had to skip a meal.</div></li></ul></blockquote><p>If you compare these figures with the ones given <a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&amp;currentPage=3&amp;categoryId=75905">for the first month</a>, you will see that the diet has increased in difficulty - not so much though that it has been hard work to keep to. As in the first month, I’ve only had to skip one meal.</p><p>The good news is that I’ve now lost enough weight for it to be noticeable, both to myself and others. Still a long way to go though!</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark <br><br>Do you think you have to eat fairly healthy anyway to have this diet succeed, obviously it is more about how often and how much you eat, rather than what you eat (except the sweet option) but presumably you could eat a diet low in vegetables and fruit, and still lose weight, although you may have to miss more meals than a person who does have their five or more a day. Has it changed what you eat, do you butter your bread still, have pizza, or lasagne, those types of things?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>8 February 2007 at 17:57 | Wendy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi, Wendy<br>The whole idea of the diet is to concentrate on one thing at a time. Complicating it with things like exercise and/or nutrition just makes it more difficult to keep to. Of course if you want to pay attention to exercising and nutrition you are free to do so and you will probably find they make it easier to keep to the weight. Just don't make them a condition of the diet.<br>Mark</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>12 February 2007 at 18:01 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Wendy - Diets don't work. Die t. Notice the word 'DIE' in diet?<br><br>When you restrict your eating the way Mark suggests, you lose weight - yes, but what you are aiming for, is to lose 'fat' not weight. You want to preserve your 'lean muscle mass' that is what raises your metabolism to burn more fat.<br><br>Your body needs energy - It takes energy to pump your heart, and do all the wonderful things your body was designed to do. If you don't give it the energy it requires - it will use up precious reserves or lean tissue, leaving you with a scrawny body, which still contains fat.<br><br>Without adequate lean tissue - your body can't burn the fat.<br><br>When you restrict your eating - 'diet' you lose predominantly lean muscle, with some fat, yet still maintain stored fat on your body. <br><br>The less muscle you have on your body, the less fat you burn.<br><br>Your body has no option, than to return to it's former fat self, with a bonus of even more fat.<br><br>As I said in one of my other posts - What you  want here is a fast metabolism - How long do you think a car will run on little or no fuel? It will soon stop - die -  <br><br>You may be able to maintain an even weight on much less food today, but what about tomorrow, next week, next month, next year? <br>Reduce energy consumption and unfortunately the result is - reduced performance, accumulation of toxins and lowered function of vital organs. End result - ???????????????????????????<br><br>SOLUTION- Raise your metabolism by eating lots of - fruit, vegetables, little meat, little fish, good fats (organic coconut oil, virgin cold pressed olive oil,little organic butter and lots of water, daily walking, some weight bearing exercises a couple of times a week. Eliminate grains and sugars completely.<br><br>RESULT - A Lean Machine. <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 July 2008 at 5:11 | Olga Szewczuk</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Dear Olga<br><br>I like the way that you start off by saying "Diets don't work" and then go on to prescribe a diet.<br><br>Since you've posted this twice in two separate places, you'll find the rest of my answer at:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2007/2/18/dieting-update.html#comment1616218">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/2/18/dieting-update.html#comment1616218</a><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>14 July 2008 at 8:36 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mark - I didn't prescribe a diet.
