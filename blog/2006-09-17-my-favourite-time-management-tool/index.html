Or perhaps you have trouble getting yourself moving on it at all? Perhaps you tend to find yourself wandering off around the net while you’re supposed to be answering your e-mails. If you have trouble with any of these, then the answer may be a very simple piece of technology – a timer.<br><br>Timers are my favourite time management tool. I started off years ago using a clockwork kitchen timer. Now I’ve progressed to an electronic one, which can also be used as a basic stopwatch. It is a flexible tool with many uses, most of which are to do with helping you to concentrate on your work and avoid being distracted.<br><br>If you have paid attention to my articles&nbsp;in the past&nbsp;you may have introduced some more structure into your day, in the shape of breaks and a definite time for stopping work. This sort of structure works best when the timings are exact. Imagine you are back in school. When the bell goes, you all pile out into the playground. The last thing the teacher wants is you hanging around in the classroom during a break. But as soon as the bell goes again, you all troop back in for the next lesson. You may have noticed how annoyed you get when you attend a seminar or a conference when the timetable starts to slip. It destroys your ability to concentrate on the subject under discussion. A timer or an alarm (like the one on a mobile phone) are excellent ways of keeping to any structure which you may have laid down for yourself.<br><br>The timer is also great for working in timed bursts. If you have a big writing project it is usually most effective to work in bursts of, say, twenty minutes with a brief pause between each. The exact length of the burst doesn’t matter so much as long as the fact that it is timed and as long as you stop immediately when the timer goes off, even if you are in mid-sentence. Make sure you time the breaks too because they will be more refreshing as a result.<br><br>The mind goes on working while you are taking a break, and you will find that it’s easy to get back to the task and that your mind has moved on because it has had a chance to assimilate. <br><br>When you are resisting a big task really badly you can try working on it for a very short timed burst of five minutes. Then you can gradually increase the burst each time, perhaps by five minutes. So you work a series of 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes and so on. This is a very good way of overcoming resistance and procrastination.<br><br>An alternative way is to say “I’m going to work on this for not less than five minutes”. Once the timer goes off you can stop or go on working as you please. But note that you must have decided which method you are going to use before you start. It’s no use saying “I’m going to do a timed burst of five minutes” and then going on working when the timer goes off. You will lose all the effect and make it more difficult for you to use the technique in the future.<br><br>Another method is to use the stopwatch for occasionally timing such things as clearing your daily email. Make it into a competition with yourself to see whether you can beat your own record. It’s surprising when you are working against the clock in this way how conscious you are of how much you normally waste time.<br><br>If you’ve never used a timer as a time management tool, then why not dust off that kitchen timer now or invest in a cheap electronic one? You won’t regret it!</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I use a timer loads at home.  Especially when I'm trying to tidy up, as I have a tendancy to get sidetracked!  Flylady (www.flylady.net) says you can do anything for 15 minutes!  And I find it amazing just how much can be done in what seems like an insignificant amount of time.  Flylady advocates the "do a burst and then stop, whether you're finished or not" method.  I like this, as it gives permission to quit, which is sometimes hard to do when you think you ought to keep going even if you're not enjoying the task.  It helps to avoid "crash and burn", too, where you do too much and then don't want to do anything for ages and ages!<br><br>I'm away from home at the moment, and forgot my timer, so I'm desperately looking for a new one!  I miss my permissions to stop  ;o)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>13 August 2007 at 7:17 | katie1980</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Excellent post - as is the rest of your blog.

I also add up the sessions each day and if I beat a previous daily productivity 'personal best' I buy myself a bunch of flowers or a nice bottle of wine to celebrate.<br><br>Another variation, when I fear I'm settling into one of my procrastination moods, is to set the timer for 15 minutes during which I have to sit absolutely still on the sofa, without reading or watching TV or phoning up a friend or even "getting the file out". The empty wait quickly becomes so boring you can't wait to start working again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>24 February 2008 at 1:18 | little b</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Little B:<br><br>I like the idea of giving yourself such a boring time that you can't wait to get working again.<br><br>It reminds me of a technique for giving up smoking I read about once. You start off by HAVING to smoke a certain number of cigarettes a day - the theory is that this makes smoking into a chore, rather than a pleasure.<br><br>I have no idea whether it works or not.

Giving myself permission to work on something for just fifteen minutes (my usual interval) makes it so much easier to give it all my attention.

What model of timer do you use? Do you recommend an up or down timer? What attributes should we look for when buy one. <br><br>Ra</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 October 2008 at 0:41 | Sun_Ra</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Sun Ra,<br><br>My timer is a simple electronic kitchen timer. You can buy them at most hardware stores. It's basically a count-down timer though you can use it to count up as well. <br><br>There are also many timers available on-line which you can use on your computer, and most mobile phones have timers as well.<br><br>For time management purposes the count-down is the important factor. You also need to consider your working environment. If you work in an open-plan office then a noisy alarm wouldn't be a good idea. You might try a websearch for a visual timer - I know they exist but I don't have any specific recommendations.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>1 October 2008 at 16:26 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>If you use Windows, I highly recommend the following free tool, Instant Boss:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/featured-windows-download/time-your-work-sessions-with-instant-boss-298550.php">http://lifehacker.com/software/featured-windows-download/time-your-work-sessions-with-instant-boss-298550.php</a><br><br>This is a Lifehacker post regarding the software.<br><br>I've been using it for a couple of years now and love it.

This approach was used extensively by Milton Erickson for many behavioral problems.  If a person could not sleep, he would tell them they MUST stay awake for some number of hours.  It works for many kinds of behavioral issues.  It sets up a tension that the patient resolves by rebelling and doing what you want them to do.  Many parents have discovered this approach with their children as well.<br><br>Mike</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>11 January 2009 at 1:12 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Mike: <br><br>Thanks for this.
