How did I get on?</p>
<p>I could have posted about this before but I delayed because I didn’t want to distract from the important business of <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2008/12/22/new-developments-testers-wanted.html">setting up testers</a> for the new system. The reason I could have posted about this before is that the system took less than a day to sift through the books and make a selection of five for me. The weird thing is that the selection (a history of Islam, a textbook about better driving, a novel, a devotional book and a history of the events leading up to World War II) is far better balanced than I would have come up with by myself.</p>
<p>This is the amazing thing I am finding out about this system. Although very simple, it succeeds in balancing the rational conscious parts of my mind with the intuitive and feeling parts to produce results which I could have arrived at no other way. Just about everything I know about time management has gone into this system and the result is something so easy and obvious that it’s difficult to see why it took so long for anyone to think of it.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>A little clue?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>23 December 2008 at 13:45 | joe jones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>It sounds like the only thing this new system can't do is make me a cup of tea...hmmm...then again... &lt;grin&gt;<br><br>I found Mark's comment below his last blog posting "New Developments: Testers Wanted" very interesting..."I'm interested in how people actually react to the new system, which includes whether they combine it with something else, or even give up almost immediately."<br><br>The "give up almost immediately" comment suggests to me that despite our (as blog readers) perceptions that Mark's new system will automatically run our lives for us while we sun ourselves on the beach counting our lottery winnings, there might well be some hard work involved in keeping it going.

The problem with LifeBalance etc is that you have to make decisions  with your rational mind about what your goals and priorities are. My system is designed to balance the rational and non-rational parts of the mind so that your goals and priorities emerge from working the system itself.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>23 December 2008 at 19:33 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Hi Mark, 'Autofocus' actually seems to have a ring to it...What do you think?<br><br>My current tea maker is very good (although she could be a bit quicker at times) so I don't think I'll need this facility.

I know it's a paper and pencil system which I like in general, BUT my problem with my ADD tendencies is that I need to have my list on my person at all times. I constantly misplace my notebook and I am in all different levels of my house all day. If I leave it in one place, I forget what it was I needed to write down by the time I get to it! That is why my IPhone (that I wear in a holster) has been such a huge step forward for me. I will be interested in determining if paper really can work for me or if not, if there is any way to make the system IPhone-friendly. I'm very willing to keep an open mind (wait, maybe that's my problem in the first place - LOL).  Thanks so much for your enthusiasm. It's contagious.
