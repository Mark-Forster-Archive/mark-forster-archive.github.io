I mean things like producing these daily tips or the daily What’s Next report, or doing the dishes faithfully after every meal.</p>
<p>The common characteristic of these tasks is that there is no specific time involved. Tasks which do have a specific time would include cooking a meal, picking up the children from school, making a news broadcast - these are all done on a time schedule and therefore don’t appear in your SuperFocus list at all.</p>
<p>Producing daily tips or the like doesn’t have to be done at a particular time - but it does have to be done during a particular day. It’s not sufficient therefore to put the task in Column 1 because you can’t guarantee that it will get done within that time window.</p>
<p>These types of task are best handled by being treated as urgent tasks in Column 2. When the time approaches that the task should be done, put it in Column 2 and it will get done - regularly and consistently.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>How will you remember to put the task in column 2 at the right time?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>23 February 2011 at 19:02 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Alan: good question! would be good to hear a response from Mark.<br><br>Mark: I can't seem to resolve the 'urgent' labelling for the type of items often described for column 2 (e.g. washing dishes). <br><br>In many of the examples given I don't know if I'm being pedantic about this.

It also provides a nice physical break from the desk / computer.<br><br>- "Feed dogs" (recurs 4 PM every day) -- dogs get fed within an hour or two, and task is deleted<br><br>- "Vitamins" (recurs 6 AM every day) -- vitamins get taken sometime that morning<br><br>- "Send out agenda for XXX meeting" (recurs 6 AM the day before the meeting) -- the agenda gets started in the morning and finished by end of day<br><br>- "Continue DVD at 46:30" (single event, 6 AM Saturday morning) -- I told the kids we'd finish this DVD this weekend...<br><br>- "Time Card" (recurring event, 12 PM every other Friday) -- Time card gets submitted by EOD every other Friday<br><br><br>Here is a task that I try to keep in Column 2 almost all the time:<br><br>- "BP / headaches" -- This forces me to record my blood pressure and headache pain levels in my medical journal for review with my doctor at my next appointment.  I keep it in Column 2 all the time, thus I check and record it several times a day.  If I happen to be moving quickly through my list that day, and hit this item more than enough times, then I will say to myself "OK this is done for today" and create an Outlook reminder to re-enter it in Column 2 at 6 AM the next day.<br><br><br>Reminders and alarms can also be used for things that aren't quite so urgent.  For example, here are some items that go into Column 1 (on the last page) when triggered:<br><br>- "Enter your action items from Meeting XXX" (recurring event, 6 AM the day after the meeting) -- I want to make sure I get my action items done, but they don't need to be done the very day after the meeting -- I usually have a week or more to get them done.<br><br>- "Set up quarterly meeting with XXX" (recurring event, 1st week of every quarter) -- Meeting is to be set up sometime for the first few weeks of the quarter, doesn't really matter exactly when.  Obviously I haven't triggered this one yet, since SF has only been public for a few weeks, but I expect it to work just fine.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>24 February 2011 at 5:30 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I may remember to do something at a particular day and time, but wouldn't count on this memory if it was important.
