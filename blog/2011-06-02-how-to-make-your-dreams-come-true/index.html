This book is now out of print, but you can download it for free by <a href="/storage/How%20To%20Make%20Your%20Dreams%20Come%20Word%2097.doc">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m seriously thinking of re-writing this book as an e-book. It’s very different both in content and style from my other two books, and I think the style tended to put many people off. What I think is needed is a clear manual which is much easier to follow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, many of the issues raised by<em> Dreams</em> are being explored by the Forum members. See the threads:</p>

If you do re-write it, I'd suggest finding a balance between giving the reader a clear map of where you're headed while still providing lots of examples of your thinking.  For a lot of people, part of the issue is not just learning a new technique, but understanding what using that technique looks and feels like.  Learning to "talk to yourself" is a messy process, and really does take you places you didn't expect to go.  The book as it is shows that, and makes it ok.  My concern is that a step-by-step guide might lose that sense of playfulness, exploration, and acceptance of imperfection.  I always find it more useful to be shown what to do, rather than told what to do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 June 2011 at 20:37 | Kalieris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>For me the frankness of the dialogues in "Dreams" was very appealing and authentic; I felt they added real humanity and is one of the things that kept me reading it. I fear a manual will be less human, but may make the methods more accessible to people. There seems to me to be quite a few manuals on similar approaches. Perhaps there is room for a revised approach.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 June 2011 at 20:39 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>One suggestion: replace "Future Vision" with "Ideal" - it eliminates push-mode drivenness to get to some point in the future and lifts the dream to a timeless vision, relaxing "push harder" thinking - or at least it does for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 June 2011 at 21:18 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I used this site to make a .mobi for my Kindle.

It's like salesmen who sell sales lessons and artists who paint about art, and writers who write about writing: They connect to their peers but not the general public.  A book that teaches dream pursuit by example of dreaming about mastering dream fulfillment techniques - I don't know if your book is like this, but it's my impression of the format.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>2 June 2011 at 22:29 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>&lt;At the moment I'm favouring the terms Future Reality and Present Reality, which I find add a bit of focus to the vision and give a more definite place of "residence" for the Future Self. &gt;<br><br>Maybe it's just me, but I feel presumptuous to talk about Future Reality and Future Self, when I really don't know if it's anything like the actual future.

For example, the consequence for NOT engaging in PUSH activity for a hobby/interest, may help increase PULL motivation, creating Flow-like states, and momentum towards things you really, really want to do. But how about the minutiae of a job, parent or general living. Often, I don't want to workout, but with some PUSH, I do feel better after I go. Yet, the internalized Mark Forster voice states: "Well, that's fine, but if you stuck with PULL, you'd be compelled to create a stronger vision for your physical body, not needed guilt,etc., to help you workout".<br><br>Anyway, a discussion of real world consequences of living in PULL mode would be greatly appreciated. I'm posting this on the forum as well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>4 June 2011 at 16:46 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>avrum:<br><br>If you an internalized Mark Forster voice telling you to do anything, you've got it all wrong.

I read the entire book first, bookmarking the exercises. Now I'm doing the exercises.<br><br>"What was better about today?" and it's making a nice difference. I've just finished my first no-holds-barred Future Vision (exercise 3). Well, some-holds-barred since everything was subject to relaxed and not over-committed.<br><br>It's encouraged me to focus on kids that will remember great parents rather than fighting to teach them life lessons. It's already paying off. The kids are still learning the right lessons, and they are happier. I'm learning to relax.<br><br>By the middle of the book, I wondered if you intended me to get the same insights from the exercises that you did.  While your insights were interesting and helpful, I hope to have a different journey with new insights. Otherwise, I might as well take a short-cut and just use yours. I'm not how to address this other than reiterate that everyone's journey, and two journey's by the same person, will have differences and similarities. (That assumes I'm right about your intentions.)<br><br>I'm not recording What was Better every day, and the exercises are sometimes a week apart, but it's good progress.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>27 June 2011 at 21:39 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Cricket:<br><br>You're right.
