<p>The first is that you can now link to a note from just about anywhere, including other notes. For time management purposes you can now put a note in Outlook Tasks (or an equivalent program), which means that you can use Outlook’s powerful reminders and alarms in conjunction with Evernote.</p>
<p>The other effect of this change is that you can use Evernote as a Wiki if you want to. From any note you have the ability to link to any number of other notes and websites. This is invaluable for project management.</p>
<p>Another important change (though not quite so relevant for time or project management) is that pictures in Evernote can now be directly opened by any of the normal graphics programmes and can also be dragged and dropped like any other picture. For photographers this means that Evernote is now a place suitable for keeping your best shots.</p>
<p>What I’d like to show you now is how I am using Evernote to write my Dreams Manual.</p>
<p>Ok, to show you that I need to open Evernote and click on the Dreams Manual notebook. I’ve got one note per chapter, so today I think I’ll do a bit of work on the last chapter “Putting It All Together”, which I’ve so far only put a few thoughts in. So I open that note in a separate window (you can have as many notes open as you like). In this arrangement, I can instantly get at any of the chapters without disturbing what I’m doing with the one I’m currently working on.</p>
<p>I’d like to show you my arrangement - that’s easy with Evernote.&nbsp; I can use Evernote to do a screen clip - let’s do that. Now it’s just a matter of dragging the screen clip onto my desktop and uploading from there directly into Squarespace:</p>
<p><span class="thumbnail-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a href="javascript:showFullImage('/display/ShowImage?imageUrl=%2Fstorage%2FDreams%20Manual%20ScreenClip.png%3F__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION%3D1308227333352',998,1295);"><img src="/storage/thumbnails/817805-12742911-thumbnail.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1308227333353" alt=""></a></span></span></p>
<p>All that took about 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Click on the thumbnail to get the full size picture.</p>
<p>The left window is the main Evernote screen, with in the left column the list of chapters and on the right the index page with a link to each chapter.</p>
<p>The right window is the open note for the chapter I want to work on.</p>
<p>And you can see this post being written in the background.</p>
<p>Of course I can resize/move any of these windows and columns to get the best working environment.</p>
<p>Pretty cool, huh?</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Very cool indeed, Mark. I downloaded the Evernote update just today, and I'm ecstatic with the new note linking feature. That was the one thing I missed from OneNote. Thanks to that peek into your Dreams post, I had given Evernote another look, and I'm now completely sold.<br><br>However, as a commentator over at their blog put it, more could be done with the hyperlinking capability by linking actual paragraphs or bookmarks within documents or PDFs. Currently, I use Sciplore Mindmapping (which is a redeveloped version of Freemind), in my line of work where extensive online research is required, most of which is downloaded as PDFs. As I annotate and highlight the material, I add bookmarks to the PDF, with a succinct one line description of the important principle in the passage. The PDFs and their  bookmarks can then be exported to Sciplore, with a link to the files. I end up with a list of the important facts and ideas from all the reading I have done, which I may use to put together a paper or opinion.<br><br>Hopefully, a third party developer picks up and runs with this in Evernote.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>16 June 2011 at 15:45 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>JD:<br><br>Yes, I agree this is one thing I'd really like to see too. Nevertheless the new version is a huge advance. <br><br>A few other things I'd really like to see:<br><br>1) the ability to re-arrange the order of notes without having to "cheat" by changing their date of composition/updating. For instance the only way I got the Index note to the top of the column was by re-dating it (I'd actually written it last).<br><br>2) the ability to remove notes from the display without deleting them. <br><br>3) compatibility with the formatting on Squarespace. At the moment I have to copy text from Evernote into Notepad and then copy from Notepad into Squarespace.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>16 June 2011 at 15:50 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Curious how every new feature of EverNote and every wish listed here us already part of OneNote.

I had intended my statement to say that those were its strengths. OneNote's strengths, though, are its rich-text capabilities and the freedom to dump anything into it anywhere on a page which make it much easier to just dump notes into it. Evernote has, in my opinion, actually become a little more cumbersome for note entry with its latest iOS version. (Their Windows desktop version is merely the same as before. I have seen NO progress with Evernote's "ease of brain-dump" features.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>16 June 2011 at 22:33 | jFenter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Mark: that could be done with one page per note, opening multiple windows, switching them to popup display (hiding all other pages).

They both have more than adequate functionality. The great advantage of Evernote is that it doesn't impose any type of structure on you. You can structure it as much or as little as you like. Because all the notes appear on the same roll, you can see everything that you've put into it. That means that you can focus in or out whenever and to whatever extent you like.<br><br>I've put up a picture of the Evernote Roll at:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/storage/The%20Evernote%20Roll..png">http://www.markforster.net/storage/The%20Evernote%20Roll..png</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 June 2011 at 11:29 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>This is too good for me to ignore :-)<br><br>To me the great advantage of OneNote  over  Evernote is that it DOES impose a type of structure on you.  These restrictions provide a tangible framework that keep your organization simple and breeds creativity as any constrained medium will do. (Autofocus itself is a perfect example of a constrained medium.).  Being limited by the OneNote structure makes me come up with simpler and ultimately more useable organization.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>29 June 2011 at 12:10 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>PS.

Thanks Clarita for the recommendation. It seems to indicate high memory usage, though. I hope this will not slow things down.

But for other types of files on your PC, the app can send it directly to Evernote, without the tedium of dragging and dropping. <br><br>And it sends to other programs too. For example if you have a document you wish to email via Outlook, a single action places the document as an attachment and off you go!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>6 July 2011 at 2:02 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Try ccToDo- ccToDo helps you put your business and personal life in order. It's a to-do list that travels with you wherever you go, and on whatever device you're using: iPhone, iPad, iPod, Windows, web, and email. Automatic cloud-synchronization means you'll never forget a task again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>15 July 2011 at 11:09 | to do list</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I have tried astrid, proofhub, evernote.
