The answer is a resounding “Yes!”</p>
<p>I’m now testing out what I hope will be the final version of my revisions, and I hope to publish it fairly soon in the form of a supplement to DIT, which will be free of charge.</p>
<p>The revision keeps the basic structure of DIT, especially the concept of “one day’s work in one day” which was its most innovative feature. However the system is now more flexible and responsive to what goes on during the day. In particular it can now cope extremely well with tasks that need to be done more than once a day. The Current Initiative is streamlined and is better integrated into the system as a whole.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is in the “audit procedure”. Instead of being just a recommendation, it is now incorporated into the system in such a way that it happens automatically. No thought needed!</p>
<p>How does DIT now compare to AF? Well, it now seems to be as responsive as AF, is a universal capture system like AF, and forces one much quicker to either do something or discard it. I’m hoping that it will hold up well under the further testing that I will be giving it.</p></div> <h2 data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Comments</h2> <ul data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Great news Mark - I love Do It Tomorrow and still use it a lot.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>26 January 2010 at 14:02 | Ann Lewis</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Great news, indeed. I use my own "revised" version of DIT every day and still recommend the book to everyone who needs it. The only really inventive thing for me about AF is the more or less subconscious approach towards tasks. It would be fantastic if this idea would find its way into the new audit procedure.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>26 January 2010 at 14:58 | M. Romer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>Just re-reading Do It Tomorrow - lot's of good stuff, some of which I seem to have missed in the first reading. Bought the book after getting into Autofocus, so I have never implemented the pure DIT methodology, but of course there's lots of other excellent tools and practices in there, too. Especially the 'little and often' example (drafts for the book) struck a chord with me, since writing reports is always a daunting task for me. I might even give DIT2 a try when it comes out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>26 January 2010 at 15:07 | JMTee</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt> <div data-astro-cid-gsbvazvt>I read Get Everything Done but have not read Do It Tomorrow. Not asking 'what have I missed?' but do I 'need' to read it. I struggled a bit with AF - the demo helped a lot though.
