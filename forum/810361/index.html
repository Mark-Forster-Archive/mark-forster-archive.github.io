So I am trying not to start any more books until I finish a few that I am still in the middle of.<br><br>Regarding Lyubomirsky's book. I bought it with great anticipation. She has a research article, which you can read for free in its entirety<br> <br>    <a rel="nofollow" href="http://tiny.cc/G0qtB">http://tiny.cc/G0qtB</a><br><br><br>that astounded me.<br><br>In a nutshell, she confirmed that writing or speaking about your thoughts and feelings about negative emotional events makes you feel better. And she demonstrated that writing or speaking about your thoughts and feelings about positive emotional events makes you feel worse.<br><br>I believe that kind of research is directly relevant to much of the work that Mark Forster and others do. So much of it is about getting your thoughts, and sometimes your feelings, written down either on paper or digitally. Traditional psychotherapy is "talk therapy." You probably don't need all that theoretical baggage of the id, transference, or archetypes. You just need to talk about your thoughts and feelings with someone else listening (actually, you don't even need the listener). And then there are a lot of cognitive-behavioral-therapy methods, many of which involve writing down your moods and then rationally disputing them.<br><br>So, the point of this rambling post, if there is one, is that you might want to read her article in addition to--or instead of--her book.<br><br>[If there are problems with the link, use your search engine for the title "The Costs and Benefits of Writing, Talking, and Thinking About Life’s<br>Triumphs and Defeats."]<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 June 2009 at 18:53 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt; You probably don't need all that theoretical baggage of the id transference, or archetypes.&gt;&gt;<br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by "You probably don't need.... ". If by "not needing", you mean "not needing" to understand the unconscious process to grow, heal, etc I would agree with you. Therapists DO need to appreciate the unconscious process. The "curative" factor of talking therapy is partly explained by the interpretation of  transference.  <br><br>&gt;&gt; You just need to talk about your thoughts and feelings with someone else listening (actually, you don't even need the listener)&gt;&gt;<br><br>I strongly disagree. One of the primary reasons people are disconnected from their hopes, dreams, etc., is because they were talking, but no one was listening and/or empathizing. Or in Family Systems parlance... you weren't Seen, Heard, and/or Understood by your family or origin. The end result is an feeling of ennui, and daily choices (mates, jobs, etc) based on rebellion or pleasing others. Therapy works because:<br><br>a) the therapist is trained to NOT get caught up in the content, but rather, to appreciate the process of the session<br>b) to provide a holding enviornment where an individual, or family, begins to experience themselves, and others, in a brand new way. <br><br>For the most part, friends and family are unable to do this for us. In general, they have a vested interest in homeostasis, because they GET something from our inability to change.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 June 2009 at 19:32 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re: Moises and article on writing, speaking and thinking about positive events:<br><br>Interesting studies, it's worth noting that the results/conclusions from the studies require nuanced interpretation. <br><br>&lt;&lt;In a nutshell, she confirmed that writing or speaking about your thoughts and feelings about negative emotional events makes you feel better. And she demonstrated that writing or speaking about your thoughts and feelings about positive emotional events makes you feel worse.&gt;&gt;<br><br>I don't think the studies indicate that. It's how you think, write or speak that influence how you feel. In her experiments she did use different 'how's' and compared the groups. It wasn't that conclusive that for example, writing about a positive life event causes worser feelings, it's just that in comparison to the other experimental groups, lower feelings were reported. There is some indication that writing about a life event in an analytical fashion isn't as good as talking or thinking about it and in general doens't boost positive feelings . Like wise writing about a negative life event seems to improve ones feelings, but repetitively thinking about a traumatic experience may do more harm than good. <br><br>It's not as simple as 'think, write or speak' about negative events to feel better and don't think, write or speak about positive events or you might feel worse...<br><br>in fact, people that have just experienced trauma usually do worse when they have to speak, think or write about what happened shortly after they have experienced the trauma. And as the paper mentions, it depends on how you think, write, speak . Thinking repetitively about a positive event seems to have a positive effect according to that particular study. (gloating can be quite pleasurable can it not!)<br><br>The interesting thing is that people don't tend to analyze positive events. Part of the reason is that there is no reason to and the other reason is that people that feel good process information differently compared to people that feel bad. If you feel bad, you tend to process information systematically, i.e. detail oriented. If you feel good, you tend to process information more superficially, using heuristics. I think the lesson in that is if you want to feel good, don't analyse!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 June 2009 at 23:25 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I highly recommend an audio book that I've been listening to this week: "Effortless Success:  How to get what you want and have a great time doing it" by Michael Neill.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Success-What-Great-Doing/dp/1401919081/ref=reg_hu-wl_mrai-recs">http://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Success-What-Great-Doing/dp/1401919081/ref=reg_hu-wl_mrai-recs</a><br><br>I used to listen to his radio programs at work and have one of his books.

Or when you find a diet that you can follow that just fits with your life.  Or a job where you really enjoy going to work on Mondays.  Or when you find a time management system that just works well with your life and your issues.  <br><br>It's like using Autofocus to me - some days I still can't bring myself to work on the book.  Then I start imagining how wonderful life would be if I could schedule myself somewhat rigidly like I did in my 20's and early 30's.    Then I start having fantasies of divorcing Mark and hanging out with Brian Tracy.  Eventually I wake up, of course.
