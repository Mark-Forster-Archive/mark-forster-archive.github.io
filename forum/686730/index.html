Might you sit down at your desk at 8.30am on a Monday morning, ready to tackle some of the tasks that actually pay your mortgage, and then find that what was "standing out" was to get up and spend all morning cleaning out the garage instead? This isn't a criticism, I'm just interested. In my early days using AF (very positive so far), I'm definitely finding myself "suppressing" certain tasks in my mind after they have "stood out", because they're not work tasks, and it's "work time". It would seem very, very strange to me not to do this. <br><br>(Apologies if I'm missing something obvious here. I've been through the FAQ thread.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 March 2009 at 16:27 | Ludlow</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think people are handling this in a number of ways...<br><br>I have one book but I'm working from one end for work tasks and the other for personal tasks... so I consciously favor the "work" tasks during "normal" working hours by starting from that end of the book.  However, if none of the "work" tasks stand out for me, I will flip to the other end of the book and see if any of my "personal" tasks grab me.  Usually one does, and it will be a small one - like starting a load of laundry or something like that.*  When I'm done working on that task, I come back to my book again starting on the work end - usually at this point I'll feel ready to tackle one of the work tasks again.  Repeat throughout the workday, and what happens is that I spend much more time on "work" tasks than on "personal" ones - the "personal" stuff becomes my breaks from the "work".<br><br>In the evening/on weekends, I do the reverse - start from the "personal" end of the book and do "work" stuff if the "personal" doesn't stand out for me.<br><br>*Other days, like today, I end up spending an hour and a half actually finishing a big project.  But my daughter's room has lovely new curtains now!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 March 2009 at 17:52 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Ludlow<br><br>There is a lot of "accepted wisdom" that recommends defiining work time and work space for home workers, so that they do not overlap.  I had often tried to do that, and felt I ought to do that, but found that my home items were my biggest procrastinators during work hours and that I was drawn to work tasks during "home" time.<br><br>I started AF with one mixed list with no preconceptions about what to do.  The first item that stood out was "make bed".  Seemed a bizarre choice but I did it.  I immediately realised that that one item had quite a significant impact, in that when the bed was made the bedroom carried the sense of being a sanctuary.  That was an interesting revelation so I carried on - AF quickly identified a number of things that I unknowingly mentally associated with tasks - and over the weeks those tasks started to settle down into a pattern.  Strangely that pattern left me doing primarily work style tasks in what I would consider work time, and domestic tasks at evenings and weekends.  What I could never do myself (separating work/home), AF achieved effortlessly.<br><br>My recommendation would be that you don't suppress what you feel is standing out because "it seems to be the wrong time".  Let AF identify why it is important to do those tasks at that particular time.  It is the extent to which we are prepared to listen to our subconscious that is the extent to which AF will work for us.  You will know instinctively when to do certain things - if the choices seem odd go with them - there will be a reason ......<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 March 2009 at 18:23 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ludlow:<br><br>Personally I don't make any distinction between work time and personal time. And as far as I'm concerned "Cleaning out the garage" is work - whether it pays the mortgage or not!<br><br>You're going through an interesting process here. First your mind makes an item stand out. And then your mind suppresses it. Note that it's your mind that does both. The list is not some power out there which makes decisions quite apart from you.<br><br>So which part of you are you going to trust? The intuitive part which is integrating all known factors, conscious and unconscious - or the "rational" part which is concerned with whether it's the "right" time to do certain tasks?<br><br>They're both you!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 March 2009 at 19:04 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find having one list is simpler - although technically I have a work context and a home context, yet much of the time I can do some of the tasks in either context so it works for me. I also like being able to review all my items in one go as it keeps things fresh in my mind and helps me to mentally move things on also. If I can't do a task in a particular context I don't get hung up on it - as I'll know I'll be able to do it another time, and as I say it may be that a mental breakthrough is reached and a task, although in the *wrong* context can be re-defined / clarified / broken down further / dismissed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 March 2009 at 20:13 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ludlow:<br><br>In the first week, I also cleaned out the garage. Not a good week, I felt overwhelmed. Then I divided work and private task and re- introduced the project list (separate), and reminded myself in AF to check my Projects and deadlines, maybe also reorder them.<br><br>Lookimg at projects from time to time helps my "subcoscious" decide what stands out. I also spend more time on work tasks this way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 March 2009 at 22:55 | Mark</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for all these very useful replies. I'm sure I have some kind of deep-seated belief that work "ought" to feel like hard work, and I do see that AF challenges that idea! Ironically (given my concerns in my initial post) what I'm enjoying the most about AF so far is the way that I *can* just do the most fun task on a page, since by the rules of AF everything will come to be the most fun task on a page at some point, or will need to be dismissed and thought hard about. I'm not sure this is quite what others here mean by "standing out", which is obviously the one slightly mystical part of the process... but probably we are all using this phrase to describe somewhat different experiences.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 March 2009 at 23:34 | Ludlow</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For right now, I'm trying to keep separate lists--not so much that I don't want to do home tasks during work time, but rather the opposite! When the kids are home, I don't want to be focussed on work, but I do still want to be busy--just with family friendly tasks like cooking or crafts.<br><br>My method (for now) is to keep two lists, but to add a note on every page or so of "work" to check the "home" list.<br><br>I find that keeps the home tasks in my mind and gives me the option of doing some of them even during work hours.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 4:38 | ds</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ludlow<br><br>The most fun task sounds like a good way of describing how things stand out!  Sometimes I catch myself doing a number of tasks on a page because they're low resistance and I can just do them, and AF certainly enables so many more tasks to be done that way, but I'm not sure that doing that is always allowing me to see what "stands out".   The more I use AF the more I seem to learn about it.  Mark talks about the initial scan of the list and then the slow scan to identify task by task which stands out.  For me sometimes I think I rush that process and just do - my aim for today is to go back to looking for those fun items!<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 9:35 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Isn't this the problem with GTD: you have many lists, one for every context - but if it is a context you rather avoid, you'll never get to the point to look at it. For me, it is the house - doing repairs etc. - that's a rather overwhelming context, because I am not the handy man at all.<br><br>But then: I started AF with one list for all. I've put "chop wood for the chimney" on it, just to see what would happen. Of course, this task rather NOT stood out. First. But on the third day - it was one of the first days of spring here, sunny outside, blue sky, a beautiful weather  of the kind that's calling you to go outside - and I came across that task and, yes, all of a sudden I WANTED to go out and chop some baskets of wood! My wife couldn't believe it, because I had postponed this all autumns and all winter, for months... And it was FUN!<br><br>Since then, it's no more a question: One list for all. I only would have two notebooks if I had a job in an office.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 11:57 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have found this aspect of the system really interesting.<br><br>I started with one list, and I found that I was meant to be dismissing tasks that I couldn't do purely because they were home task (eg context sensitive).  So, in order not to re-enter tasks, I added a home context to my notebook. <br><br>My immediate thought was to transfer all my personal tasks onto this list, but that turned out to be disastrous.  I would only look at my home list when I was home, and some of the personal tasks were getting delayed because I would normally get them done at work, when I was on my computer, or near a phone or whatever.  So now I limit my segregation to purely context reliant tasks.  So I have home (ie must be physically at my house) and errands and "everything else".<br><br>As to mixing personal and work tasks, Autofocus just cleans out the mess.  Personal tasks used to distract me from my work stuff a lot, and I used to timeblock, and all sorts of things.  Now, I will work on a personal task if I feel like, and it then gets done.  I think I was previously trying to prevent myself from "procrastinating" so it would take longer to get done.  Or if I chose to do a personal task in work time, I would end up finishing it, where AF gives me permission to do a burst on it and then set it aside.<br><br>So my list started out more personal than work, and it is slowly becoming more work than personal.  Not only that, but I am getting work tasks done that I have been procrastinating about for weeks.  Amazing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 12:18 | DrCris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm really now of two minds about the question.  I have always been a one list person.  That is so logical to me it never seemed worth thinking about.  But now I realize that I do use multiple lists but more for projects than contexts.<br><br>For example, I have a separate list for my computer maintenance projects.  I have a number of systems here with various problems, software updates needed, etc.  The thing is that when I'm in the mood to work on computer stuff, I like to see it all laid out in front of me so I can work on it more logically.  Even if I see an entry on the AF list "Update system 1 to SP3", and it moves me to get to work on that system, I'm likely to open the computer projects book and see if maybe I should update all the drivers first, or maybe delete junk files first, or run a defrag program, or do a backup, or ...<br><br>OTOH, I don't really see this as using separate lists.  I have a master AF list and everything gets written there.  If I think about backing up the computer, it goes there.  If I see an entry to do anything on the computer, I'll go to my list of computer tasks and work from there, however.  I'm kind of schizo that way ;-)  I suppose it is really a kind of redundancy and I usually wind up crossing things off in multiple places ... a practice I hate on theoretical grounds and one which makes me think about a digital solution (where you can have one entry that appears in multiple contexts because of tagging) bu then paper just works so well that I don't want to do that either.<br><br>As others have noted I see great benefit to seeing things mixed in together in random order and it is just that mixing that often helps break log jams (like the chop wood story above).  It probably has to do with "comparative resistance", as someone somewhere (in all this blizzard of ideas) wrote.  "Chop wood" might be a high resistance task when compared to other things on the page like "Wash dishes", but once "Wash dishes" has been crossed off and "Chop wood" is left on the list with only such tasks as "Pump out septic tank" ... well, it sure seems like a mighty attractive thing to do on a nice early spring day to get out and get some fresh air and exercise while chopping wood.  LOL ;-)<br><br>So there it is ... one master AF list with supplementary (and usually somewhat redundant) project lists as needed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 13:03 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Dr Chris:<br><br>This is why I advise in the instructions that if you are going to have separate lists, then they should be by location rather than by type of task (work, personal, etc). It's where the task is done, not what sort of task it is, that is the crucial point.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 13:57 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>On this issue of physical contexts... and I don't think this is an original point, because I've seen it mentioned somewhere else on the forum, but... wouldn't it work just as well to use one single list with a "cheat rule", whereby an item could be re-entered rather than dismissed if you gave it some thought and realised that it was purely for contextual reasons, rather than reasons of psychological resistance, that you hadn't yet done it? This would seem to work better for multiple (ie more than two or three) contexts than having a whole bunch of lists, which you might never look at until you were in the relevant context. <br><br>If, at the dismissal stage, you felt there was a context you were actually avoiding altogether, you could add an item to the AF list to switch to that context (eg "Go to garden shed then review AF list for garden-shed-based tasks...")<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 14:50 | Ludlow</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ludlow:<br><br>&lt;&lt;if you gave it some thought and realised that it was purely for contextual reasons, rather than reasons of psychological resistance, that you hadn't yet done it?&gt;&gt;<br><br>If a task has got to the point where it is likely to be dismissed, then there will already have been multiple opportunities to do it. So it's very unlikely that the reason it hasn't been done is "purely for contextual reasons".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 15:24 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark - a very good point, but if so, doesn't that argue even *more* in favour of a single list, even for people with multiple contexts? I'm not sure how to square your reply with your advice that people who have an office and a home that are in two different places should keep two lists. Surely they will have multiple opportunities to get round to everything on the list?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 15:31 | Ludlow</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ludlow:<br><br>I wasn't arguing again the single list. I was arguing against the cheat rule.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 16:29 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark - pardon my ongoing argumentativeness, I'm really, really interested in figuring this out. (If you want to stop responding to me on this I won't hold it against you...!)<br><br>I realise that you were arguing against the cheat rule. But your reason for being against the cheat rule, as I understand it, is that AF is designed to give you multiple opportunities to do a task before it becomes a candidate for dismissal. In other words, you'll almost certainly have been in the relevant context, unless you're deliberately avoiding that context. So either way, if you haven't done the task, there's something else about that task that's causing resistance.<br><br>If I am right about that, why do you need this rule in the instructions?<br><br>"DO use a separate notebook and list for each location, e.g. Home, Workplace."<br><br>...surely, if I use one list for all locations, I will eventually get an opportunity to do everything - or alternatively need to think hard about why that thing is on my list? <br><br>Again, apologies if I am missing something obvious...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 17:41 | Ludlow</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have one list for work and home. It's all work to me, although most of it is fun. (I like to work.) I color code my files and my calendar into "Make" (studio, art career), "Teach" (classroom, academic career) and "Life" (everything else). (ADD-er here.)<br><br>My creative work--the "Make" or "my work" is often (but not always) fun. (There are difficult and resistant tasks in any endeavor worth doing, in my experience, although overcoming obstacles is also something I consider "fun.") And my university committee work--part of "Teach" or "work-work" is NOT fun (although sometimes I am surprised). But all these tasks are ultimately advancing "my work" in some way. So it makes more sense for me, and is much easier, to keep one list. I LOVE clearing away "Life" and "Teach" tasks because that's also clearing the way for "Make."<br><br>I haven't found any issues with context or saying to myself, "gee, there's nothing I can do because I'm in my studio and not at home." Or, "gee, I can't work on this studio project I'm enthralled with because I'm at home."<br><br>That may be, in part, because so many of my domestic chores are time-chunked and routinized. If it's 6:30 AM I am doing a, b and c. If it's 6:30 PM I'm doing x, y and z. And all appointments are on my calendar, so that takes care of when and where I have to be.<br><br>It's also because I want to unconsciously keep advancing my creative projects, so of course I welcome those ideas any time and any place, whether I'm in my studio or not. That's why I have a journal or "portable studio." And I have plenty of "research, investigate, think about, review" tasks in AF. So I keep those projects moving forward.<br><br>Similarly, I welcome the breaks to do errands or make phone calls when I'm in my studio. As I posted before, when I'm on a deadline or facing a complex and unpleasant task I use a timer to either limit or expand my work periods and keep me focused. "Life" tasks make great breaks during those periods, demonstrating again that something becomes more pleasant when compared to something which is unpleasant.<br><br>I have dismissed tasks both "home" and "work" tasks, and not because of context. I have always had many opportunities to do the task before dismissing it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 18:04 | Liz I.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ludlow<br><br>I keep one list for all but if I was working in a client environment with AF lists there may well be occasions where I would want to have that work in a separate list, particularly if other people were likely to see the list.  I wouldn't feel it would enhance my credibility to have a list on view with "write client report" next to "clear sock drawer"!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 18:34 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ludlow:<br><br>The rule you quote is aimed at the classic Home v. Work situation which about 95% of office-bound employees find themselves in. It is as if they live in two distinct worlds in which there is very little overlap - perhaps just the occasional task like "Call my bank" at work, and "Finish report by deadline tomorrow" at home.<br><br>In that situation it's much more efficient to have two separate lists. You don't want to be scanning loads of irrelevant home tasks while at work, or loads of irrelevant work tasks while at home.<br><br>However the situation becomes much greyer where there is a significant overlap between Home and Office tasks. In that case it can be quite difficult to judge whether it's more efficient to use one or two lists. Ultimately one can only decide by trying out both, and seeing which works best.<br><br>My point is that, whichever you choose, you should work your list(s) according to the rules about dismissing tasks.<br><br>I hope that has made it clearer.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2009 at 15:02 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It has! Thank you. <br><br>It seems to me that the time and energy invested in scanning irrelevant tasks would really not be that significant, whereas the time and energy involved in figuring out which home tasks should go on the work list might be quite annoying - but clearly this is a case of 'do what works best in one's own situation'.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2009 at 16:01 | Ludlow</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ludlow:<br><br>It's precisely at that point - where the time and energy invested in scanning irrelevant tasks equals the time and energy involved in deciding which home tasks should go on the work list - that the dividing line lies between having one list or two lists.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2009 at 18:24 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark posted earlier in this thread: <br><br>"This is why I advise in the instructions that if you are going to have separate lists, then they should be by location rather than by type of task (work, personal, etc).

I think Mark mentioned that if a task is likely to be dismissed, then it has been reviewed multiple times so the issue is unlikely to be for purely context reasons.<br><br>I think this is inaccurate.  80% of the time I work through my AF list, I am at work.  So if I kept one list, I would review home tasks (like change sheets or fold up clothes) regularly, but still not be in a position to review them.  Cheats don't help as they add a long standing task to a new list, where it will likely to ignored for a while more.<br><br>So having a distinct physical context list is important for my time-poor location, IYKWIM.  I would not consider having a work only context, as I review my main list multiple times at work.  Does that make sense?  Anyway, the reason I realised that I needed this list was I tried one list and it turned out I had too many physical-context-sensitive tasks to let me dismiss pages appropriately.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 March 2009 at 1:25 | DrCris</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
