Care needs (should/ought) to be taken when selecting said dishwasher, as it can occasionally come accompanied by various psychological issues of it's own.

I hope it's not too late?<br><br>Though I remember my 3 year old daughter, having got marmalade all over my calculator, did carefully hand wash it with the rest of the dishes. It took a couple of days to dry out, but then was fine. So perhaps careful hand washing in warm water with plenty of detergent? Or perhaps things have moved on in the last quarter of a century (dear Lord, where did it go?) and it would be safer to accept the tea stains as part of the patina of life, and think of us fondly whenever you notice them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2009 at 6:32 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will<br><br>I am so sorry to have inadvertently touched a nerve - perhaps there is a branch of "Doleful Laptop Users" in your area?
