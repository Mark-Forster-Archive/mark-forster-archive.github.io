My work is not overly date or deadline based, but is an ongoing set of items that frequently change. Adding everything to one master list has really helped me to reduce stress at work, as I know that nothing I need to do will be forgotten. Not only that, but I love crossing off a task and adding it to the bottom  of the list when I've done some work on it, even though I haven't finished it. It keeps the list dynamic and me motivated. Best of all, when I'm bored of looking at something, I just scan the list for something smaller and more manageable to do to pass the rest of the afternoon, or to get me through a patch of boredom :-) It's without a doubt the best method I've ever used in the workplace to control my own work, and has really helped me to feel like I have everything under control.<br><br>Now the bad news: at home it is a completely different story. I still haven't actually completed a single page of items. I am reluctant to put aside those things which I don't want to do, because they do still need doing, hence the list just depresses me when I look at it, as it seems like an endless set of insurmountable tasks around the home and garden. I've done some of the more enjoyable things - reading books I've listed etc., but there are huge sections of list which just don't ever budge. I'm not sure what it is about the home list that makes it so different from the work list, but as a start I think there are two relevant issues:<br><br>1) At work the list is on my desk, and in my line of sight all day. At home I can come home, make dinner, do some stuff around the house, slump exhausted in front of the TV  and go to bed, without ever actually opening the notebook.<br><br>2) At work the tasks are all very similar - they involve either talking to someone, or doing something to progress a project. They are easy to define and break down into small to-dos. At home the tasks are so diverse - read a book, finish tiling the bathroom, plastering in the lounge, hang a roller blind, organize digital photos, go for a run. Each item seems like a much bigger undertaking than anything on my work list, and a much bigger effort to  actually start. <br><br>I think what I have realized is that the majority of things I feel I should be doing outside of work, I don't actually want to do at all. Ever. Maybe I need some kind of major lifestyle overhaul :-)<br><br>Obviously I'll be sticking to this at work, probably forever!<br>I'll try it for a little longer at home - if I have any breakthroughs I will update.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2009 at 13:28 | faye</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A quick follow up - I've just read through the huge amount of suggestions and FAQs about the AF system, and have re-visited my list with a bit more enthusiasm. I'm going to try rephrasing my home tasks and making the tasks smaller, to provoke less resistance.<br><br>Not only that, but I realize I have a tendency to scan the whole list, and not just a page at a time. I can see that Mark has clarified you should do something from a page until that page is done (tasks all worked on or dismissed), so I'm going to be stricter about that, as I quite often just look at the next page when nothing looks like fun on the first one (oops).<br><br>Will see how the next week goes :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2009 at 14:04 | faye</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I know some people who work longer hours at what they do best and earn more money to hire people to do what they hate doing.  Just a thought.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2009 at 14:05 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Love my job - hate DIY and housework...<br><br>You might have a very good point ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2009 at 14:08 | faye</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Faye:<br><br>To get the right effect from AF it's important to look at each page as a unit, as you say. But it's also important to go through the page looking at each item in turn individually. Don't just skim the page until you find something nice to do.<br><br>I think from what you say that you may still not be doing the system quite right. You only HAVE to do one thing from a page each time you visit it (though normally you would do more). Items only get dismissed from a page if you don't do ANY of them on a visit to that page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2009 at 14:50 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Faye<br><br>Just a tip for getting going on your home list - you could try doing just a quick scan of your list/s whilst in AF mode at work, or on the journey home.  I think the fact that tiredness stops us from even opening our notebook is a material fact and if you can find a trick to make that easier that could be just the breakthrough you need. You have said that you do "some stuff around the house" in the evenings.  If you put onto your list those very items then you will effectively be giving yourself permission to do those things "when you feel like it" and you may well find that is all the kick start you need.  And don't forget to add "make dinner" and "watch TV" to your list!<br><br>Mike's point about employing someone is a good one!  It sounds as if you are already  experiencing the benefits at work, and once you translate it to home I am sure you see ways around the "daily drudgery" that will surprise you.  <br><br>Good luck - keep us posted!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2009 at 16:12 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find the same: it works superbly at work, and doesn't take off at all at home. One of the reasons is very obvious: at work, I'm working from my desk a lot of the time, and my notebook lies in front of me as a central point of reference. At home, the things that need to be done are not necessarily desk-based, so working from a notebook is way less evident, purely from a logistics point of view. I would venture the statement that the AF system is ideally suited for (mainly) desk-based, office jobs, and much less for other types of circumstances.<br><br>Are there people her in non-office jobs who found ways of overcoming this obstacle and making it work?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2009 at 17:33 | Marc (from Brussels)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Absolutely, Marc!  I tend to treat my notebook "at home" as if I were at work.  If am "working" in my study then my notebook is on my desk, if I am "working" at the dining room table, or from the sofa then that is where my book is.  If I need to go to another room to action a task then I just return to my book afterwards, sit down and scan from where I left off.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2009 at 19:00 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
