Just show me the peer-reviewed study which has been reproduced more than a couple dozen times.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yeah, I can believe that all I want and it won't make it so, will it? ;-) The problem, of course, is in studying thinking and beliefs. Not exactly the same as chemistry. How do we measure mental processes accurately. We can't. That does not mean that our beliefs/thoughts don't affect our health. The placebo effect may be proof of that influence or proof of intermittent symptoms. Peer-reviewed studies or no, the anecdotal and experiential evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of an influence of thinking on health outcomes. And btw, you're setting the bar awfully high demanding well crafted research replicated more than 24 times! <br><br>Do you deny that it's even a factor? I'm certainly not arguing that thoughts are necessary or sufficient for recovery from cancer. IOW, you may believe you're going to die and you don't. You may believe you will recover and yet you die. But does it play a role? IMO, absolutely. Good grief, that's the case for diet and exercise considered to be vital. Ask any hospice worker if people have an influence over their deaths. How many will themselves to hang on until a special event or a loved one arrives or leaves? I'll be astonished if you don't believe it is an important factor. After reading more about chemotherapy's minimal impact on survival rates for breast cancer for example, I would argue attitude/beliefs/whatever you wanna call it are every bit as important. <br><br>So how far has my intelligence ranking fallen?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 April 2010 at 3:45 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If thinking can't cure a common cold or heal a paper cut how can it possibly cure cancer?

We're all individuals and as a couple with one son still living at home (now a top notch nurse, sparked by witnessing Gill's care 15 years ago), we approached it our way and adapted as we went along.<br><br>We stopped ourselves  asking "Why" (the condition could have been triggered by Chernobyl, my own Dad - not related to Gill - had it when he died in 1994) early on and decided to focus on what we thought were the important things such as getting a better perspective on everyday life, prayer and support from true friends and close family, and trying to maintain a sense of humour, if a little dark at times.:<br><br>"Keep your hair own, Mum!" said Tim when Gill, in the middle of some pretty savage chemotherapy and bald, freaked out over some trivial thing.  Gill had two wigs then which we named "mood" wigs as we could tell her frame of mind from which one she was wearing.<br><br>It was tough, but we got through it even though the condition is not curable, yet.<br><br>One of my favourite, cynical sayings which we trot out now and then: <br><br>"Cheer up, things could be worse.  So I cheered up and sure enough, things got worse."<br><br>For anyone going through something similar, my advice is: hang in there, and deal with it your own way as best you can, when (if?) you emerge from your ordeal, chances are you will be quite a different person from the one you were before.

Is that naive, too? I'm wondering if you read my whole post? In no way have I suggested that there is a one-to-one relationship between thinking and disease just as there isn't for diet and exercise. But to dismiss it as a powerful force is what I think is truly naive.<br><br>RogerJ, I'm sorry for what you and Gill had to go through.

Some witnesses tried to comfort me by saying that it's as bad for the the spouse (or parent) as well as the patient.  I used to thank them for trying to comfort me, but told them it was not like that for me.

Where to even begin?  My Irony Meter is so badly broken that I doubt I'll ever get it back from the shop.<br><br>Norman:  Can you still be stuck in the Reductionist Fallacy?  Apparently so.  And here I was starting to think better of you.  &lt;tsk tsk tsk&gt;<br><br>And what do you mean that the mind can't cure cancer?  How would you know?  You seem to begin by saying that the mind does not exist.  (Or are you simply speaking for yourself?)<br><br>You said: "Believe all you want that "positive thoughts" (whatever that is) cure cancer. Just show me the peer-reviewed study which has been reproduced more than a couple dozen times."<br><br>Well, "positive thoughts" are thoughts which are "positive".  Does that help you at all?  They are thoughts about getting the result you desire rather than about the results you do NOT desire.  It is actually a pretty simple concept.  You focus thinking on being well rather than on being sick.<br><br>Next, I don't think anyone (certainly not I) said that thoughts cure cancer.  You seem to have left out the description I gave about there being multiple causes for things.  (Remember me going into germ theory for a second there?)  I'm confident that no one can say (which is not to say that they WON'T say) what cures anything.  The best minds (as I define them) agree that the body cures itself and all medicine can do is get out of its way.<br><br>Finally, what the HELL does a peer reviewed study have to do with anything?  You seem to be confusing knowledge with those who grasp it.  (I assume that by "peer reviewed" you mean reviewed by those who disagree with the idea?)   But if you like that approach, just show me one peer reviewed study that shows any miracle has ever happened.  (And here "peer reviewed" would be those who do not believe in miracles.)<br><br>Lastly (as opposed to finally) there is the whole issue of using the right tool for the job.  One does not try to determine how much something weighs by using a stop watch ... one uses a balance.  Likewise, one does not determine the effectiveness of a course of treatment by empaneling people to talk about how many milliliters of good thoughts were used simply because they evaluate chemotherapy that way.  Heresy though it may seem to be to you, the correct tool for the job is not always found in a chemistry lab.  Psychologist made that mistake a couple of centuries ago and psychology as still not recovered.  As it turns out, observation works, even if one does it while not wearing a lab coat.  And people HAVE observed the beneficial results of "positive thoughts".  They have even written at length about it.<br><br>Oh, and one last final thought: the universe is not "fair".  Disease is not "evil" -- it is part of the reality in which we live.  It is not "out to get you".  Taking it personally and getting angry with it really does not seem to help ... at least as shown by all the peer reviewed studies I've seen.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 April 2010 at 9:55 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Steve,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If thinking can't cure a common cold or heal a paper cut  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>How do you know it can't?  How do you know that is not exactly what does cure a common cold and heal paper cuts?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  how can it possibly cure cancer?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Is the mechanism important to you?  Or the result?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   I have never understood the appeal of this naive belief.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Far from being naive, it is on the bleeding edge of mind-body research.  And its appeal is that it works ... for at least some of those who use it.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  It strikes me as a cruel insult to those who are sick and can't get well.   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>OY!  Hyperbole thy name is Steve!  ;-)  Seriously, a "cruel insult"?  It is an observation from those who have used it and feel it has helped them.  (See the several books by Norman Cousins.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 April 2010 at 10:03 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Norman, since we were locked out of the last thread, I thought I would respond here.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>You beat me too it.  I was going to come at it differently but then it is probably better that you took up the gauntlet.  I was going to say something boorish about the Irony of Norman being the one to scream that the thread needed to be locked because he did  not like it ... after all of those who tried to shout HIM down.  But then, my Irony Meter is busted, as I said.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Yeah, I can believe that all I want and it won't make it so, will it? ;-) The problem, of course, is in studying thinking and beliefs. Not exactly the same as chemistry. How do we measure mental processes accurately. We can't. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>More accurately: we can't mearuse them in the same way that we measure the speed of a car or the weight of a sack of flour or the cost of a pound of coffee.  The method of measurement has to be appropriate to what is being measured.  Psychology has failed miserably in doing its job precisely because of the failure to grasp that simple idea.  It all went to hell with the behaviorists who decided that since they were to stupid or lazy to figure out the APPROPRIATE way to measure mental effects they would measure how fast rats could find cheese ... because they already knew how to measure with a stop watch.  (It is one of those find the problem to suit your solution kind of things.  Or, if your only tool is a stop watch, then the question must be: "How fast do rats run a maze?"<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  That does not mean that our beliefs/thoughts don't affect our health. The placebo effect may be proof of that influence or proof of intermittent symptoms.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>The placebo effect is so well established that it is now used as the standard by which all drugs are measured -- by those same people who deny it exists or has any benefit.  How is that for a busted Irony Meter?  LOL ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  'Peer-reviewed studies or no, the anecdotal and experiential evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of an influence of thinking on health outcomes. And btw, you're setting the bar awfully high demanding well crafted research replicated more than 24 times!  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, not many studies meet that criterion.

After reading more about chemotherapy's minimal impact on survival rates for breast cancer for example, I would argue attitude/beliefs/whatever you wanna call it are every bit as important.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I'm sure the day will come when doctors will talk about the barbaric days of chemotherapy.  But for now, it is the best they've come up with.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  So how far has my intelligence ranking fallen?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Hey, we've talked about that, right?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 April 2010 at 10:19 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I swore I'd not waste another hunk of time today with this nonsense but when I stumble on this kind of incredible nonsense ....<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;  Honestly, I dunno if it is worth digging all the BS out here.

That you say they are not is of limited effect.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  The only ground I can allow is that yes something like "thoughts" have something to do with biology and thus do condition the biological organism and thus in some way must have some effect on cancer and that effect is probably so insignificant as to be immeasurable and irrelevant.<br><br>But that is a very, very weak statement.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, but it is your statement.  It is scarcely the position of those who are more informed about this.  And speaking of logic: how can you deny something on principle then acknowledge its existence although "insignificant, immeasurable, and irrelevant".  And how the hell can something be both "immeasurable" and "irrelevant"?  In order to say that it is not relevant you first have to measure it.  See what I mean about logical fallacy?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Even the effect of diet and exercise on cancer is very small and correlative. We hardly understand anything like "diet" and know that something like moving around is some manner is better than too much or not enough, but where that line is we don't know.   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>And that brings us back to logical fallacy.  Not knowing WHY something works is not the same as it not WORKING.  Moreover, there is plenty of evidence that many many things have an effect and not understanding precisely what has which effect on what is not at all important to those trying to get well.  If one changes diet, exercise, thinking and also does chemo and then gets better ... how is it logical to say that the chemo did it but not the diet, exercise and positive thinking?  All you can say is that they got well (and even that is a vague statement) and they did AT LEAST these things.  Who knows what did which?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  The fact remain that we know almost nothing about the causes and conditions of cancer. Certainly it has almost nothing to do with what we think.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Once again, logic.  You can't have it both ways.

There are plenty of peer reviewed journals that support that. But you don't need peer reviewed journals, the case is pretty overwhelming in favour on the influence of thought. What gets people tripped up is the idea that we cause our own illnesses and maybe to blame. And then if we don't recover we are again to blame because we didn't do and think the right things. Both these things are incredibly unproductive types of thinking and really beside the point.<br><br>&gt;&gt;The only ground I can allow is that yes something like "thoughts" have something to do with biology and thus do condition the biological organism and thus in some way must have some effect on cancer and that effect is probably so insignificant as to be immeasurable and irrelevant.&lt;&lt;<br><br>That's like saying 'thought has something to do with these buildings outside'. Obviously they were constructed and many variables came together. Thought must have been just one of them. We're not entirely sure what the main cause of these buildings was. Was it the market demand? The buyers? The people living in it? The plumbers? The contractors? The propitious landscaping conditions? The bricklayers? The iron industry? The economic climate? The fact is we know that the entire civilized worlds can be contributed to ideas that popped up in the minds of people. It takes an initial idea to build a skyscraper. Just because we have a lot of thoughts that are seemingly insignificant doesn't mean they are insignificant. (I'm not saying that every health condition is caused by thoughts, I'm only saying that thoughts are not insignificant contrary to what Norman is saying). <br><br>The reason we should rightly be deliberate about how we think is because it's the thing we have the greatest control over. It's the only thing we really have the ability to choose. We can't pick our dna, our parents, the country we're born in etc. But we can influence the quality of our thoughts, what we have our attention on. And low and behold, at the end of the day, that's the only thing that matters. If we give up the reigns to that we render ourselves as robots at the mercy of probability and outside conditions.<br><br>The scientic method is great but its methods lead to reductionism. Every person, every situation is different. Scientists collect data to find meaningful patterns.But to take an extreme example, chaos theory tells us that we literally can't predict or determine the origin of an effect precisely. What do you think our chances are for determining that 'significant' contributor on a case level when you try to examine groups of data. All you're going to get at most is factors that seem to correlate. We can only say sensible things about the patterns we see on a group level and even on that level we're limited.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 April 2010 at 10:52 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, <br><br>You misunderstand me.

You seem to have decided that thinking is not effective.<br><br>You'd have to dig into it probably more than you'd like to but it seems as if "thinking" takes place in more places than the brain.  We are starting to come around to the notion that thinking is distributed throughout the entire organism.  IOW, you DO think with your heart (and liver and lungs and spleen).

It's a scary day when I agree with most of what you're saying. LOL <br><br>It seems one point of confusion is that I was arguing that thoughts are effective apart from biochemical changes. Not short of a miracle and even then, there ARE biological changes. Having seen firsthand what thoughts do to people's muscle tension and pain via biofeedback, I couldn't possibly deny the power of our thoughts. Then there's the voluminous research that shows that talk therapy is AS effective in remediating depression as antidepressants, EVEN to the point of changing brain chemistry in the same way. Oh and how about the thousands of studies showing a link between "stress" and immune functioning? What is stress? Apart from true physical stress, it's our thinking about what's happening to us. That's why an injury that will sideline a professional athlete is perceived as much more painful than the same injury that means a soldier can leave the battle (providing he wants to leave!).<br><br>The caution as we've pointed out constantly now is not to make any assumptions about the connection between thinking/beliefs and disease in specific people.

But I can't see much point in quibbling about what position in the chain of causation thoughts have. The results wouldn't have happened without the actions, and the actions wouldn't have happened without the thoughts. So what?<br><br>I'm not so sure that thoughts aren't things anyway. They are electrical pulses in the brain (or whatever the correct terminology is). If, as Norman seems to be saying, there is no such thing as mind, then it would appear to me that thoughts have to be things in the sense of being part of the material world - there isn't anything else they could be. Whatever they are, they affect the material world, sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 April 2010 at 15:11 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I leave this thread. There is just too much BS here. And Mike you are outta your league when it comes to rhetoric.<br><br>All I can say is that I doubt that hardly anyone here could give a coherent description something like a "mind" much less something like a "body". Especially when trivially concepts like the placebo / nocebo effect and causation vs.correlation are misunderstood.  What a "mind" is and "body" is remain unsettled by the greatest minds of our tradition. <br><br>But I am letting you believers off the hook. Assume the pedestrian medical understanding of things like "thoughts" and the "mind" and the "body" and show a peer-reviewed and reproduced study where thoughts were measured and had a direct link in the causation of the remission or progression of cancer.<br><br>No statistically meta-analysis please. Even these poorly constructed studies motivated by persons seeking to prove such a link have been shown to be fundamentally flawed.<br><br>Or simpler yet, demonstrate how one measures a thought quantitatively and qualitatively without the subject or the person measuring it being aware of the nature of the outcome.<br><br>Or simpler yet, let the subject know and the person measuring the thought know what you are doing and explain to me how you measure the magnitude and quality of the thought.<br><br>Or simpler yet, explain to me in a coherent manner how you would measure the quality of a thought and the taxonomy you would use to describe them and how each those categories of thought you might expect to affect the development of cancer.<br><br>If this trivially aspect of experimental design is too daunting, then really this thread has nothing to offer than mere conjecture, anecdotes, and personal belief. Which is fine, but let's call a spade a spade.<br><br>And Mel those studies about therapy and other things you note have no impact on this discussion (since through implication you are trying to prove an entirely different point) and they are widely debated and criticized. Can't double-blind that kinda stuff and there are many reason that even *psychologists* doubt the result of such meta-surveys. For example, someone who pays thousands of dollars for help, is likely to think it helped. And change in brain chemistry does not mean much of anything since we have no idea about much of brain and "mind" interaction. As noted above, we hardly know what a "mind" is. It is best a correlation.<br><br>And really, most therapy is a bust. Just look at long-term smokers and addicts. Easily measured and followed and supposedly they fit perfectly into the behaviorist theory of human behavior and yet most have no success in the long term.<br><br>And for those arguing above, I will give you a tip, you can't prove a negative.<br><br>My point is the that thoughts affecting the remission or progression of cancer has zero hard scientific proof and probably never will since such things cannot be studied by science. For some reason everyone keeps trying to argue against a weaker position, even then unconvincingly.<br><br>It is like trying to use science to prove the weak case of God's existence. You can't and you surely can't prove the stronger case of Calvin's notion of salvation.<br><br>BTW, I was unable to think my dishes clean last night. I even tried to think my body into walking. Not even that worked. Then I tried I slow my heart rate by thinking that didn't work either. I did drop my HR by about 20 BPM by engaging in action. I thought all kindsa thoughts and my HR remained low including "increase BPM". It is a practice. You should see what I can do with BP, it freaks nurses out.  <br><br>What we lack is a proper understanding of the prejudice of the mind, thoughts, and body we have developed in the Western Tradition. We think we know what these things are, because they seem the most natural and obvious of things. It is proximity that blinds us to their unfathomable nature.

That is the whole problem with "The Secret". It basically posits that thoughts are "things". &gt;&gt;<br><br>Well, I have no truck with "The Secret" so I'm not going to disagree with you about that. But I can't see much point in quibbling about what position in the chain of causation thoughts have. The results wouldn't have happened without the actions, and the actions wouldn't have happened without the thoughts. So what?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I guess that the point is that someone proposed that only actions (physical ones) had any effect.  If you simply think that you are getting better and don't actually DO anything different then the argument implies that thinking will not help you get better.  I think that delineating a clear difference between thought and action can only make things more clear.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I'm not so sure that thoughts aren't things anyway. They are electrical pulses in the brain (or whatever the correct terminology is). &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>That is the same reductionist argument that Norman uses.  Thoughts are not the same as the brain that causes them.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  If, as Norman seems to be saying, there is no such thing as mind, then it would appear to me that thoughts have to be things in the sense of being part of the material world - there isn't anything else they could be.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Well, just because Norman thinks that I don't see why that would make it true.  <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   Whatever they are, they affect the material world, sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Without a doubt they affect the world.  I just think it pays to be clear about what things are so that any conclusions we draw are more likely to be on target.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 April 2010 at 23:05 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, maybe you should slow down and read my link on psychoneuroimmunology.

They may therefore be an important part of the healing process of the body (frequently not successful, just the other healing processes of the body are frequently not successful).<br><br>I'm not sure Norman can have it both ways. If there is a mind and it produces thoughts then it's possible for it to be wrong. But if there is no mind, then the thoughts are just part of the process which the body is going through and cannot be wrong in the same sense.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 0:07 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I leave this thread. There is just too much BS here. And Mike you are outta your league when it comes to rhetoric.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Thank you.  I was working to avoid rhetorical tricks and stick with logic.  I'm frankly puzzled about 1) why this simple concept is so difficult for you and 2) why you seem to be so emotionally involved with it.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  All I can say is that I doubt that hardly anyone here could give a coherent description something like a "mind" much less something like a "body".  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>And so what?  Not being able to define something does not prove that it does not exist.  I'm not entirely sure I cold give a "coherent description" of a tennis shoe but I'm wearing two if them now so I'm confident they exist.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Especially when trivially concepts like the placebo / nocebo effect and causation vs.correlation are misunderstood.   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>By everyone but you?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  What a "mind" is and "body" is remain unsettled by the greatest minds of our tradition.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Damn few of them deny that either of them exist, however.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   But I am letting you believers off the hook.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Way cool!<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Assume the pedestrian medical understanding of things like "thoughts" and the "mind" and the "body" and show a peer-reviewed and reproduced study where thoughts were measured and had a direct link in the causation of the remission or progression of cancer.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Still on about peer review?  Oh, and what happens if I decline to join that game?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  No statistically meta-analysis please. Even these poorly constructed studies motivated by persons seeking to prove such a link have been shown to be fundamentally flawed.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Mmmm, yeah.  And I'm surely going to bite that hook.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Or simpler yet, demonstrate how one measures a thought quantitatively and qualitatively without the subject or the person measuring it being aware of the nature of the outcome.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Why would I?  I'm not trying to prove what mind is nor describe how one might construct an experiment.  I'm just pointing out that your position that thinking positively can't help is logically flawed.  One does not approach the question this way.  But, should you be interested, I gave link to some Ernest Rossi books in a previous post and he is one of the researchers in the forefront of this.  You can probably find what you seek there.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Or simpler yet, let the subject know and the person measuring the thought know what you are doing and explain to me how you measure the magnitude and quality of the thought.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Again, what does it matter?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Or simpler yet, explain to me in a coherent manner how you would measure the quality of a thought and the taxonomy you would use to describe them and how each those categories of thought you might expect to affect the development of cancer.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>See above.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  If this trivially aspect of experimental design is too daunting, then really this thread has nothing to offer than mere conjecture, anecdotes, and personal belief. Which is fine, but let's call a spade a spade.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>O.K.  A spade is a spade.  What puzzles me is why you'd be so riled up about this.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  And Mel those studies about therapy and other things you note have no impact on this discussion  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I think that they are right on point.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  (since through implication you are trying to prove an entirely different point) and they are widely debated and criticized.   Can't double-blind that kinda stuff  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I suppose if you were to work at it you could construct a good experiment.  Why not try?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and there are many reason that even *psychologists* doubt the result of such meta-surveys. For example, someone who pays thousands of dollars for help, is likely to think it helped. And change in brain chemistry does not mean much of anything since we have no idea about much of brain and "mind" interaction. As noted above, we hardly know what a "mind" is. It is best a correlation.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Honestly, I have no idea what you just said.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  And really, most therapy is a bust. Just look at long-term smokers and addicts. Easily measured and followed and supposedly they fit perfectly into the behaviorist theory of human behavior and yet most have no success in the long term.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>WOW, what a generalization.  Some programs work and some don't.  That does not mean that nothing works.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  And for those arguing above, I will give you a tip, you can't prove a negative.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  My point is the that thoughts affecting the remission or progression of cancer has zero hard scientific proof and probably never will since such things cannot be studied by science. For some reason everyone keeps trying to argue against a weaker position, even then unconvincingly.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I don't understand what you said there either.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  It is like trying to use science to prove the weak case of God's existence. You can't and you surely can't prove the stronger case of Calvin's notion of salvation.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>&lt;fzzzts&gt;  (The sound of my brain frying.)  I'm sorry but I can't do much with these one-line non sequiturs.  And if you think I'm inclined to get sucked into another religious debate, you're whacked ... and I say that in the nicest possible way ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  BTW, I was unable to think my dishes clean last night. I even tried to think my body into walking. Not even that worked. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Your failure to get up and exercise, is hardly proof of much.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Then I tried I slow my heart rate by thinking that didn't work either. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Perhaps you need more practice.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I did drop my HR by about 20 BPM by engaging in action. I thought all kindsa thoughts and my HR remained low including "increase BPM". It is a practice. You should see what I can do with BP, it freaks nurses out.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>You seem to be more interested in having fun than understanding the ideas presented.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  What we lack is a proper understanding of the prejudice of the mind, thoughts, and body we have developed in the Western Tradition.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Then the answer is in Eastern Philosophy?  You know the real answer but it is too deep for us to comprehend?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  We think we know what these things are, because they seem the most natural and obvious of things. It is proximity that blinds us to their unfathomable nature. To use a crappy book for its title: in Plato not Prozac lies the future of this understanding.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Uhhh, that is not what the book has to say.  It argues for rational thought as a way to mental health.  It does not argue that ideas are unfathomable.  And, BTW, I did not think the book was crappy at all.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  What the hell, I give ground if you can simply give a convincing and robust definition for a "thought."  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>And yet one more time ... not being able to define something does not serve as proof that it does not exist.  I'm not interested in defining "thought" ... and as that seems to be your interest, maybe you should take a crack at it.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I like BSing as much as the next guy, but when it comes to compounding the suffering of others by thoughtlessly (since sense of irony is low here, this is irony) suggesting a fix or refuge in something I cannot even begin to explain much less prove, I try to be thoughtful and pause.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Maybe you just ought to avoid thoughtlessly suggesting a fix?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 0:43 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey J,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Mike, maybe you should slow down and read my link on psychoneuroimmunology.

Presumably as an atheist you don't think there is some sort of "soul" involved. I'm not disagreeing with you here, just seeking clarification.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>As Norman would say, we don't know a lot about what they are.  I can better say what they are not.  They are not equal to the brain.  That is the reductionist fallacy that Norman seems to be stuck in.  They are not "things" which are somehow generated and take on a physical existence.  They can't move around and change reality in any way ... they can only affect the thinker himself and that is where this all started.  Thinking positively changes us in ways that improves health, among other things.<br><br>No, there is no "soul" but I'm not going to say what mind is ... in fact, there are some philosophical arguments that whatever it is, it is not likely to be able to say much about itself.  But let's not go there.<br><br>------<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  My problem with what Norman is saying is that, if there is no such thing as mind - which is what I understand him to be saying - then thoughts are presumably produced by the body.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Well, yeah, what else would produce them?

They may therefore be an important part of the healing process of the body (frequently not successful, just the other healing processes of the body are frequently not successful).  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, exactly so.  A related idea is one by Milton Erickson which goes a bit like this:  Disease is caused by the imbalance of various chemicals in the body so if the body caused the imbalance the body can correct it.  (Don't hold me to the precision of the exposition of that idea.)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I'm not sure Norman can have it both ways. If there is a mind and it produces thoughts then it's possible for it to be wrong. But if there is no mind, then the thoughts are just part of the process which the body is going through and cannot be wrong in the same sense. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yeah, and if the body is producing thoughts the name we give to that process is ... wait for it ... "mind".

But it does sound interesting.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 1:53 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm not sure that darwinistic theories are the future, nor do I think assumptions that mind and consciousness are simply byproducts of a material brain. I think one of the problems in science is that researchers are hell bent on finding the mind in the parts. But we don't even understand the parts, because the deeper we look, the more mysterious they act. <br><br>We're only just figuring out that (brain)cells are much more than we thought they were. We are finding out they have their own computing power, that they make decisions. Or to quote University of Cambridge research biologist Brian J. Ford. "Each individual neuron is itself a computer, and the brain a vast community of microscopic computers... the human brain may be a trillion times more capable than we imagine"<br>When Darwin lived, they thought cells were blobs of matter. <br><br>With that we can only start to appreciate how hard it is to measure thought and its effects, especially when it involves so many systems interacting. We can only take measurements of visible signals that take place that our measurement devices can pick up on. Right now that's typically by making brainscans and seeing what areas of the brain light up and are deemed 'activated' and by measuring electrical and magnetic activity. But FMRI studies are easily misinterpreted and there is only so much we can deduce from the apparent frequency of a thought. In a recent BBC program that debunked potential positive effects of brain games, they did a fairly simple demonstration where two people raced cars that were controlled by their thoughts (With neurofeedback equipment). We are at least capable of training our equipment to distinguish two thoughts. <br><br>We've got studies going as far back as the sixties that show we can accomplish effects in simple organisms, like bacteria, from a distance, using thought alone. That's two steps ahead of what Norman feels is possible. That's evidence that is over 40 years old. <br><br>My problem with a materialist approach is that it is a deadend, it's a cop out. This analogy came from a materialist, I might have been Daniel Dennett, I can't remember, but the analogy tries to explain the mind as follows. You take the musical instrument, say an Organ, we know it can produce incredibly complex melody when all the notes are played. We know a lot about how this musical instrument is constructed, the wooden frame, the pedals etc. All the individual elements are quite simple, yet they give rise in unison to something really complex, music. A materialist is comfortable in saying that the mind is the result of a collection of parts giving rise to consciousness etc. What a materialist can't answer, and more alarmingly, doesn't feel is important to answer is why the music sounds beautiful, who is playing the music, why it is playing the music and who composed the music. Like wise, a materialist can't explain why we feel emotions, they can only say, well there's all these neurochemicals bombarding certain parts of the brain. They can't explain why chocolate tastes so good. A materialist can't explain why despite the absence of brain activity, a landmark study done in the Netherlands found that patients suffering cardiac arrest reported perceptions and experiences associated with near death experiences. This should be impossible based on materialist approaches. <br> <br>Norman referred to the article discussing the apparent rise of the placebo effect over the last decades. One of the underlying problems in science is that it's never really objective, that's mostly an illusion. The underlying motives of pharmaceutical industries have influenced the results of experiments of drugs, which is probably the main reason why we're seeing strange data around the placebo and nocebo effects. What seems to be the case is that the practice of science, where we are told to hold our hats on to ideals of rigorous evidence using controlled and strict criteria and peer reviewing every study in detail, in actual fact is always subject to bias and underlying motives and that is what shapes research for the good and the bad. A current trend for example, is the use of Neo-darwinism as one of the bases of evidence to attack religious influence in the world today - we see scientists like Richard Dawkins calling for the head of the pope. And who knows if it is a good thing that scientists take political stances as bold as that, but it definitely underlines how much the practice of science is ruled and coloured by very human motives. <br><br>The sad thing is that research into consciousness, free will, the effect of thought and intention  are researched mostly by a fringe group of scientists who get little support. There are again very human reasons for doing so, because it's 'not done' to deviate from a materialist approach, to question darwinism. Any suggestion in the opposite direction leads to ridicule. It's certainly not the open mind like culture you'd expect based on scientific ideals. And it's no wonder that a lot of the major advances in science have come from outside the establishment. <br><br>But the interesting thing is that answering questions about the nature of thought, intention, consciousness, mind and free will are all interrelated, and how we approach these important questions has everything to do with how we approach life. Reducing the brain to a machine that secretes thought also has implications on how we treat free will (in which case free will is just an idea not actuality), consciounsess, morals, responsibility etc. Just one answer to one of the above topics reveals a lot about one's stance on all of the above. Or it reveals a lack of understanding or lack of appreciation for the ramifications of an assumption we might hold. <br><br>I think it's naive to put our heads in the sand and make statements like Normans, as if they were factual. I also think its naive to depend entirely on what science has produced in the way of peer reviewed study alone in the current moment, considering the state of affairs I've pointed out above. It's a cheap cop out. And in similar vein, like Mike said, just because we have concepts like the mind and thought that are hard to confine in a definition we can all agree on, doesn't mean we should discard the topic.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 11:23 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great posts Mike and Peter. <br><br>‘The difference between what the most and the least learned people know is inexpressibly trivial in relation to that which is unknown.’ - Albert Einstein</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 13:11 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>&lt;&lt; No, they are not "entities".

Everyone has a definition for anything thing they speak about implicit or explicit.<br><br>Science is a pallid and boring way to understand most anything but it does have its place. The role of thoughts and their affect on cancer is one of them. So far science has absolutely nothing to say on the matter.<br><br>Whether the brain or the pancreas has a role in remission or progression of cancer is another topic. <br><br>The very fact that you would assume a thought to be something "material" and a "process" of a brain is proof of these lingering and problematic notions of the "mind' and "body" within the Western tradition.<br><br>To paraphrase a great mind who struggled with these issued in probably the most thorough and rigorous manner:<br><br>The most thought-provoking thing about thought is that we have not really begun to think about it at all.<br><br>This from one of the most penetrating thinkers of the past 2500 years. And simply attempted to form the problem in a thorough way. So no, I don't have any secret knowledge. I just am aware of the utter void of rigorous understanding in this area.<br><br>Forget the body. We handed that over to science a long time ago. This is a scandal of the Western tradition. And again, this does not imply that the East has something to offer. We have to return to our tradition (we have no choice for it is all we have) and see what bare threads exist which have informed of understanding of the body and pursue them in a rigorous manner.<br><br>But all that is beside the point. <br><br>Define a thought in such a way one can measure qualitatively and qualitatively.<br><br>You can't. We don't thoroughly understand what we mean by this word. At best we have analogous phenomena gathered by various crude instruments measuring meager aspects of our "bodies".<br><br>Whether these are merely correlative or epiphenomena we can only guess, unless we just simply label these measurements as thoughts.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 17:22 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To put this thread back into the context of "Getting Things Done". If thoughts are so powerful as to cure cancer, then it would seem that are powerful enough to simply get done what needs getting done.<br><br>CBT (the black belt of thought practice) should have an enormous success rate in helping people achieve everything they want as well as curing smoking, crack addiction, depression, etc.<br><br>It doesn't. But that is just evidence they were not thinking properly. <br><br>And if thoughts are as powerful as everyone believes, we can just ditch this forum. Put your mind to the task and it will get done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 17:27 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"If thoughts are so powerful as to cure cancer, then it would seem that are powerful enough to simply get done what needs getting done."<br><br>Good one, Norman!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 17:37 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>We don't need to define "thought".  We don't need to measure thought quantitatively or qualitatively.  <br><br>Nobody here is claiming that thought cures cancer.  Several are claiming that what you think has a bearing on how your body behaves.  <br>This has been proven by the placebo studies:<br><br>Give treatment A, and this results.  Give treatment B, and that results.  Only A and B are both medically inert substances, so the cause of variation is something other than the treatment.<br><br>We are getting nowhere with the debate if you just deny the fact of these studies.<br><br>My position: Thinking does help.  I can raise my hand by thought.  I can increase or decrease my heart rate by thought.  I can inhibit my body's immune system by thought, but more effectively I can use my thinking to  buy fast food to weaken my body, or I can use thinking to buy healthy food and live more healthy.  None of this will cure cancer, but continuing in unhealthy fashion can only hurt.<br><br>As for this forum, effective thinking isn't always easy.  I'm learning things here that help me get things done more effectively.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 18:22 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
