It often has a pretty picture for each month. There may be a small space provided to write events in, but it is the representation of the month in diagrammatic form that is the focus. Another use of the word is for things like the "church calendar" which shows when the major feasts of the year are.<br><br>In UK English the word "diary" has two main meanings:<br><br>1) A book in which you write about your life day by day. The most famous example is Samuel Pepys's diary.<br><br>2) A book in which you put all your appointments etc for the coming year, e.g. "unsold 2010 diaries are now selling at half-price". This is the sense I have been using "diary" in the instructions for DIT2/AF5.<br><br>Other words with similar meanings would include "journal" for diary sense 1 and "schedule" which is a detailed breakdown of a short period or particular subject, e.g. "my schedule for today" or "the conference schedule" or "my schedule of seminars".<br><br>How does US English use of these words compare? I'm asking so that the final version of the instructions is comprehensible to both sides of the pond (not to mention the rest of the world)!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 10:45 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good Morning Mark,<br><br>The place where you record appointments is:<br><br>- Calendar (most common)<br>- Schedule (which more often refers to the day itself)<br>- Agenda<br>- Daybook (a bit more rare)<br>- Daytimer (a brand but often used for a portable schedule book)<br><br>Where you write events passing:<br><br>- Journal (most common and very much preferred by men)<br>- Diary (has the sense of something used by women and little girls)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 11:20 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sorry, I also meant to add that the term "diary" used as a place to record appointments seems VERY odd to the US ear.

I would not think to call an "appointment book" (yet another term, Mark, but this one has the sense of something used in a nail salon to record appointments for customers) a "planner".  Do you think that this usage is more likely to be heard from those who use their book to "plan their life".  IOW, for goals and such.  In business I have not heard that usage.  Planning is done in meetings or on spreadsheets (if financial) or on paper tacked all over the walls ;-)<br><br>I think that "planner" would be understood as Mark means "diary" but only by a specific subset of the culture.  Now that I think about it, the term "day planner" would be more similarly understood.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 11:35 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;People who have less exposure to English spoken outside of the US would not have a clue what you meant. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I don't agree - I do a lot of training and many of my delegates speak English but are not from the UK - most often they speak with UK English roots.  It really depends on where they have come from.  Most from the Indian continent have a UK based English. I would have said that many European countries have a US based English (mainly gleaned from films and music) however many large global businesses like Shell use UK based English and spellings.<br><br>I think the trick is Mark to try and find something generic that all can understand - it probably doesn't really matter if it sounds a bit 'prissy' to some as long as they understand what you mean.  I think the term 'dated planner' probably is widely understood.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 11:43 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Allison,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;People who have less exposure to English spoken outside of the US would not have a clue what you meant. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I don't agree - I do a lot of training and many of my delegates speak English but are not from the UK - most often they speak with UK English roots.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>So then they would have exposure to English spoken outside of the US, right?  ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I think the term 'dated planner' probably is widely understood.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I can say that I have NEVER heard that term.

"pop".<br><br>I am convinced that Daytimer uses the term "planner" as well as does "moleskine".  I am just trying to reflect to Mark what my "ear" tells me.  People may go to Daytimer and buy a "planner" but they then tell me they are writing it down in their "calendar" ... or possibly "Daytimer" ... or just "book".  "Book" is heavily dependent on context so it is probably not what Mark wants to use.

Those are probably the more popular representations in the U.S., in my opinion.<br><br>In another discussion, I alluded to the difficulty in finding a "page-a-day diary" available in the U.S. that wasn't visually disrupted by pre-printed time-slots for appointments.  It's just not as common here in the U.S. (no wonder many Americans can't manage tasks properly).<br><br>I wouldn't necessarily try to satisfy all of the American English variants, but address the population of people that are coming over from other time management methods.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  Include a photo of your diary opened to a set of blank pages to convey what you mean by diary.<br><br>My sister might right in her "diary" before going to sleep.

In fact most of the ones sold in the shops are printed with labels like "2010 diary". <br><br>It is also common for us to have "one day per page yearly calendar, with room for some notes on each page". The difference to us is "calendar" will be displayed on the wall, whereas "diary" would be a book on the desk or in the pocket.<br><br>Historically, Malaysians have been using UK-based English, but we are slowly getting Americanized in our English usage.<br><br>Mmm ... Could Mark just use the full name "one page per day diary" at least once at the start of the description, and continue with the short name "diary" thereafter?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 14:05 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike,<br><br>&lt;&lt;I am convinced that Daytimer uses the term "planner" as well as does "moleskine".

I don't say I am adding them to my planner. At home my planner contains both my calendar and my to do list (now my Autofocus list). At work we use outlook and don't have paper calendars. At work I use a spreadsheet for my Autofocus/to do list.<br><br>So planner may not be the exact term like diary is but I can't think of anything closer.

The second meaning that you give "a plan of one's own likely to be in conflict with others" is also very common but a different term entirely.  I would suspect that in a Fortune 500 company you could hear: "He put this item on the agenda for today's meeting so he must have a hidden agenda".  It can easily be seen how the second meaning derived from the first.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 19:02 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>One final thought on this.  America is not one place, linguistically.  I know that GB is not either, but I suspect that the regional variations are wider here.  At least in GB you have RP which, I take it, most citizens would understand, if not speak.  Here someone from Arkansas would likely hear someone from Michigan talking and call him a "damm ferner".<br><br>There is also a second layer of variation ... those who are into time management and those not.  While I stand by my statements about some of the terms not being well understood in the way you might mean, that is from the perspective of the general population.  How many in the general population plan anything but the next day's TV watching schedule?  So those are probably not the people you care to reach.<br><br>I concur with the suggestion that you show a book opened to blank pages and call it what you will, preferably "calendar" for us here in the US.  I suggest "calendar" for the reasons I've given but even more because the KEY point is that it be dated.  My planner actually has no dates, it is a ruled notebook ;-)  <br><br>I also concur with the suggestion that the first time you use the term you make it descriptive:<br><br>"For my list I use a book that has one page per day with the dates on each page.  Mine has no time slots for appointments because this book is NOT intended to be a place to write upcoming appointments.  If you are shopping for something suitable in the UK, I am using (model #,see picture above) but you may find a different form factor more suitable.  In the UK you could search for ("diary" or whatever) while in the US you can search for ("calendar" or "planner" or whatever conclusion you have drawn from your input here ;-).  You could also simply write the date on the top of each page of any blank book of convenient format."  Etc. <br><br>I imagine written like that (assuming there are no legal ramifications with showing a picture of your book or mentioning a specific manufacturer) it would be hard for anyone to misunderstand your intention.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 19:20 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Earlier today I posted a reply - now I don't see it here :(<br><br>But anyway - here's a link to a "day planner" that seems to fit the bill for your new system:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.officeworld.com/Worlds-Biggest-Selection/REDC550CRED/09Q1/">http://www.officeworld.com/Worlds-Biggest-Selection/REDC550CRED/09Q1/</a><br><br>I think as long as you are clear that what you are suggesting folks use is a one page per day, with lots of lines, whether someone refers to this as a diary or a planner, they'll get it.<br><br>Claudia</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 23:36 | Claudia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I know that GB is not either, but I suspect that the regional variations are wider here. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Wat ye taakin aboot, hinny?
