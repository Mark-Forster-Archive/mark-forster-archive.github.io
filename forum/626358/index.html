Your attention is focused on one short page of items and you work on that page so long as you feel that there are items to do.  Once you have worked on an item, you cross it off, and move it to the bottom of the last page of your list if there is more work to be done on that item.  New items are also added to the end of the last page as they come up.  You work through your list, page by page, until you reach the end of the last page, then you start over on the first page.  Pages are completed, and excluded from further review, when all items have been crossed off or if on any pass you elect to not take action on any of the remaining items on a page."<br><br>I don't know.

How?  You create<br>your list, adding to it throughout the day as MORE and MORE items come to mind.<br>You scan the first page twice, once quickly, then more slowly until the combination<br>of your brain "pulls" an item out that is in conjunction with both your conscious<br>and unconscious goals.  This is the item that "POPS" into focus automatically.<br>  You work that item until tired, stopping work on it for any<br>previously scheduled appointments which are kept in a separate area.  <br>    Upon return to the list or ending the time you want to work on that item.  If the item is finished you cross it out.  If not, you cross it out and add to the end of the list.  You'll get<br>there, we promise.  <br>   Then you continue to scan that page to the bottom, and from the top to the item jsut completed looking for something to POP into focus.  Nothing that page?<br>   Then you follow the process to the next page all the way until the end of the list, and repeat.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 January 2009 at 19:28 | Bob</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark<br><br>Your own suggestion works for me.

I will of course be amending the Quick Start to make it clearer as well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 January 2009 at 23:21 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>As much as I like the idea of clarifying things before rolling out detailed information, I wonder whether it's really possible in one comprehensive sentence.  As Mike pointed out, there are quite a few things to be considered.  Yes, it's basically very simple, but only once you are withing the framework of AF.  Without that framework, much of the AF action, both internal (towards AF) and external (from AF), tends to become very vague and prone to personal interpretation.  <br><br>AF is basically about writing a number of lists that then get reviewed and actioned according to some simple rules.  And this is where it might all get too complicated for one sentence.  Closed lists, passes through the list, re-entry - all these aspects have to be introduced and defined before they can be used for clarifying the methodology.<br><br>I am pretty sure it's not the main core aspect of AF that people misunderstand, but it's more of the nitty gritty, the real-world application of the few spelled-out and the few? not so few? implied rules.  I feel that what could be done is capture the "heart" of AF in a sentence.  But what that means in detail would have to be dealt with in detail, because the more concise and the less spelled-out I become in formulating the rules, the more people have to interpret the rules - and this is where misunderstandings arise.<br><br>I think avoiding misunderstanding will come from spelling everything out in such detail that personal interpretation is not (that) necessary anymore. Clear guidelines and rules, a quick overview of the system (as you have it in the instructions already), and a flowchart or something similar will go a long way in making clear what might have been unclear in the first run.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br><br>Joshua</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 0:44 | Joshua</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My humble contribution:<br>"... an ongoing, multi-page list where each page is treated as a separate closed list and worked repeatedly until no single task stands out, at which time you move on to the next page and repeat."<br><br><br>I've left out the way in which tasks are chosen, and how tasks are dismissed, but my grammar isn't good enough to do so without creating a monstrous run-on sentence.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 2:59 | Ed</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Do at least one task per page, working on it only as long as you want to;  when you're done, cross it off and see if anything else on the page grabs you; if it doesn't, move to the next page;  unfinished tasks (and remember, you don't have to finish a task on the first go) should be crossed off anyway, then re-entered at the end of the last page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 3:23 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A method that encourages you to develop one master task list, and then use a combination of page breaks and your own intuitive sense of what *really* needs to be done to determine the order in which tasks are accomplished.<br><br>(Much more detail than this will require a very inelegant sentence, or more than one sentence.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 4:11 | Matt C.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Could I also suggest in addition to summarising what AF is in the guide, that often a good way of explaining what something is, is to explain what something is _not_?<br><br>There's a few points of confusion that have come up in the beta test (which I think arise from people's experience of other systems) that could be clarified in this way? e.g. AF isn't this just a big open list because....

Beginning with the first active page, select one task that feels right to work on. When you are done, note a follow up task on your last list if required, and then review the page to see if another task on that page feels right. If nothing further stands out after completing your initial task, move onto the next page and repeat the process.
