I need to turn things around lots quicker, both in terms of deciding and working... Has anyone come up with a shortened version, as in just move to D/W/2W or something? -Gordon</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2010 at 17:26 | Gordon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gordon,<br><br>Are you doing Little and Often? <br><br>At first you put the item at one month. But if you do the slightest 10 seconds of wok on the item, it gets re-entered at 1 week. <br><br>So, even if you rephrase the item, you've done some work.<br><br>Does that help?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2010 at 19:59 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Gordon.  Entering a task 1 month away from today doesn't mean you don't touch it again till 1 month away.  Every day between now and 1 month from now, you should be cycling through the DWM list and, as Moises says, the task is then re-entered at 1 week away if you don't complete it all.  So if you cycle through the entire list every day, you will have had about 30 opportunities to take action on a task before its 1-month deadline arrives; or if you only cycle through the entire list once a week you will still have have 4 opportunities to take action.  If a particular task has had no action taken on it by the time you reach the day the task is due to expire, you have to take some action that day (even a tiny bit) and re-enter it at the day 1 week from now, or it gets dismissed.  That's how DWM is supposed to work.   <br><br>If you have fast-paced work, then it's even more important to cycle quickly through the list, so that you're constantly reaching the newer items at the end.  Because you don't need to action any item on your list until it "stands out", in theory you can quickly skim through from the oldest item to the newest.<br><br>It may be that one of the other Autofocus versions would suit you better and you could try each in turn.  Best of luck with your efforts.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 July 2010 at 10:56 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So what do you do when you moved a task reminder to one week from now, but everday for the next three days something comes in which allows you to work on the task? If I put down a note that I am waiting for an item, and write it a week from now, then tomorrow it shows up, I could flip ahead 7 pages and scratch if off, and then work on it, then re-renter it, but that seems senseless. But if I don't do that, then why have the system? <br><br>On the other hand I could I just use the entry as a calendar reminder until I get to it, and then re-write it. Sort of like "working ahead" on my assignments. If I was working a list, I would cross it off an re-enter, but that doesn't seem right in this instance. I end up filling up dated pages with work I have already done, and on different days than I actually did it. <br><br>So to Moises, the more granular my approach, the more I end up feeling frustrated for the reasons above. So that can't be progress.<br><br>For Margaret, I may indeed need to go completely back to AF, it may just be an emotional thing. On the other hand, I wish I had a workable "system of rules that functioned using a planner, because I like the daily tracking of work coming in and work completed. I am still interested in the variations others are using for that reason.<br><br>Thanks to both of you for commenting.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2010 at 5:53 | Gordon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello Gordon: I have to move into more granular detail as I am more involved in project management more than I have been for a long time.  I need to schedule tasks for my local colleague here in Damascus, monitor them and also do some of the tasks myself, eg after translation from Arabic to English.<br><br>Having come across kanban courtesy of another thread on this forum, I am now using leankitkanban to manage the current project and tasks.  It's not the ideal solution for every situation, but it's working very well, and my project team leader seems pleased with it as he can see how things are progressing (or not!) without waiting for our fortnightly review meeting.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://leankitkanban.com/Home">http://leankitkanban.com/Home</a><br><br>It's working well for me, I can just put 'Kanban board' in my Daily Closed List and DWM list, then see the next task or tasks unfold.<br><br>It's free for one board and five users, just enough for us here at present, the only problem for me now and again is not having 24/7 Internet access.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2010 at 11:41 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gordon, it sounds like you think you are supposed to focus on tasks with today's date. This was a common confusion early in DWM, and completely false. The dates are the Last Possible date to START doing a little bit of work. The system does not track due dates or date completed. <br><br>You should every day look at all tasks on your list, and every day do ANY that feel ready. This includes that one where info came in today for a task dated next week. With DWM the very idea is to work ahead.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2010 at 13:13 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The dates have very little to do with anything.  They are there to help you place three bookmarks or tabs:  one for today, one for a week from now, and one for a month from now.  Then the rules take over.  Add things at a month.  Re-add things at a week.  Expire or dismiss things today.<br><br>Work through the entire list.  Hopefully you get through it at least once a day.  If your workflow is lost of small tasks, you probably go through it more than once a day.  You will likely spend most of your time either completing things at the end of the list  in one shot or things at or before the one week point using a little and often approach.<br><br>For me, things that are not completed soon after they are entered are either left until they are dismissed or are acted upon right away and worked on using little and often until they are completed.  I don't have a lot of things that get their first action 2-3 weeks after they are added to the list.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2010 at 4:39 | MartyH</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
