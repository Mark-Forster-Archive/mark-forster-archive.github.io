This would be true of any system, but one of the benefits of AF2 is it makes it more obvious.<br><br>Does this reflect a need to become more focused? Does it mean the essential issue is one of psychology?<br><br>Have other people been finding this, and perhaps found a way to adapt to keep the list at a fairly constant length, without compromising on the left brain/right brain benefits of the system?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2009 at 11:04 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Laurence - my list is trending steadily upwards (in terms of # of open items) at the moment too, but at least so far I think that's primarily because it's essentially a new list that I've only been working for ~10 days.<br><br>Obviously I don't know your exact circumstances, and an ever-increasing list *can* be a sign of over-commitment, but unless you've also got a consistent feeling of being overwhelmed (without reference to list statistics) I'd give it a fair amount of time (at least a few weeks) before making any major assessment.<br><br>Several factors could easily cause, or help resolve/mitigate, this effect - without necessarily indicating a long-term over-commitment, such as:<br><br>1. Any new AF list (v1 or v2) will tend to grow consistently at the beginning, as new ideas combined with gradual re-introduction of backlogs (prior lists, whether AF or not) will tend to outpace actions taken. It should (hopefully) in time reach a relatively stable situation where its length varies within a fairly consistent range.<br><br>2. If you start to break activities down more (say, starting to use the technique of breaking down a current multi-step action directly at the end of the list) the list will tend to grow until the dismissal line reaches this part of the list - at which point it should re-stabilise since the whole list then has the new, higher proportion of smaller tasks.<br><br>3. The more items that're being added that don't get actioned, the higher the number of contiguous unactioned tasks in a block at/near the front (oldest part) of the list is likely to be, and hence the rate of dismissal will increase - which may (or may not) then lead to a new equilibrium between new and done+dismissed items. There will be a lag between these two events though, while the dismissal line progresses forwards towards where the rate of new items increased - during which the list will appear to be ever-increasing.<br><br>(...and there may well be others)<br>How long have you been working your AF2 list, and was it 'from scratch' or using a prior AF1 list?<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2009 at 20:08 | SteveB</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks SteveB, that makes a lot of sense to me. So I am going to just stay with it, and stop counting the numbers of added and dealt with items for the time being, and see how things are further down the line.<br><br>I started AF2 when Mark announced it a couple of weeks ago, with a fresh notebook, so there is still new material to be added before a steady state can be reached.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 18:43 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>When I started AF1 in January my list grew very quickly and over the following weeks the rate at which I entered tasks varied according to whether I was addressing backlog issues or just adding day to day stuff.  In February/March when I had a real backlog blitz, my list grew to 708 open tasks.  That gradually declined to a general average of around 400, give or take 20 or 30 but with AF2 I am consistently clearing more tasks than I add.  I think that is in part because there was a fair amount of "fluff" within my old list, but I suspect that we will all have a "comfort" figure which we will balance out at, giving us enough choice to avoid procrastination but not enough to result in overwhelm.  That figure will no doubt be different for each of us - I suspect Jacqueline's will be a lot lower than mine :-) but I'm sure will eventually stabilise.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2009 at 1:38 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Laurence - obviously it's entirely up to you, but I wouldn't necessarily feel you "have to" stop recording statistics. My point was more that *acting* on them at this stage is probably premature, not that recording them is necessarily useless (in case it came across that way).<br><br>There are many cogent arguments that these kind of statistics aren't really of any use (as discussed in several other threads), but - used sensibly - there may be some useful observations to be gleaned. I guess it really depends on personality as to what you want to do.<br><br>I'm personally noting the following stats daily, when I do the "start of day" routine (dismiss, mark new on-notice, read through... and note stats):<br>1. # of items actioned / dismissed the previous day (easy to see as I note the date of "crossing out", just as D/M, in the margin)<br>2. # of items added the previous day (I put a short line, with the day's date, across the margin between lines at the start of a day, so again trivial to count)<br>3. # of open items in the list (easy calculation from previous day's total and 1 &amp; 2 above)<br>4. # of lines from oldest open task to the end (calculated from previous day's value, 2 above, and # lines from the previous on-notice block to today's)<br>5. # of days from the oldest open task's entry-date to today<br>6. # of pages with open tasks<br><br>I'm 98% convinced that this is over-kill, and will probably reduce the set at some point, but as my task list reaches (I hope) a relatively stable "flow" I will be able to (a) identify that, (b) get some idea of what 'normal' is for me (possibly useful to identify problems that might occur in future if my workload / work pattern changes, etc.), and (c) figure out which, if any, of the stats are worth continuing with.<br><br>In particular #'s 4-6 are all ways of measuring the "spread" of the list, and I suspect that even if I continue noting down stats over the longer term I'll end up only recording one of them (my money's on #5 at the moment, but it's early days).<br><br>I may even decide that there's little to be gained from the numbers and stop entirely - but recording all of the above only takes a minute or two anyway, so since I'm a bit "stats/analysis inclined" as a person there's not really a problem even if I pretty much just record them "in case they might be interesting at some point"!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 July 2009 at 14:29 | SteveB</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Laurence, the same thing happened to me with AF1 - where my list became too long (anything over ~ 15 active pages or about 100 tasks is too long for me, 8 pages and about 75 tasks is ideal).  I have found that keeping the list at a certain level (ie. your personal sweet spot) is easy to do and I focus on doing this weekly.  I do it by limiting what new projects I put into the system, working on older tasks and through liberal dismissal and I believe that the same concept would work for AF2 as with AF1.  <br><br>The only danger I can see with AF2 (for me anyway), would be that I have to have a filter on my "ooh, I want to do this!" tendencies.  AF1 gives the time lag that allows this filter to kick in.  YMMV.<br><br>I track my stats, emphasizing how long it takes to close pages - I have about 85 closed pages since Jan. 5 (home book only) and my # of days to close pages has gone down considerably - from an average of about 35 days to &lt;15 days - so it's a great motivator.<br><br>Overall, I think the indicator is that if you're having to work with tweaks in an effort to make the systems work properly, the list is unmanageable.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 July 2009 at 17:14 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>SteveB: Thanks, there is no harm in having too much data, the stats will be useful in time I am sure. I am using a very small notebook, with narrow pages, so I have to be careful with layout. But I will see what I can fit in. In the meantime I am continuing to track items added against items done. Yesterday it was 23/15. However what I really like to see is the horizontal line advancing through the pages every morning, which tells me that every single item on the first seven pages (only 13 lines per page, but 91 tasks) had been actioned or dismissed, and this bar is moving, it seems, inexorably through the book. So an obvious measure (if you are doing it non-digitally) is to compare the rate of passage through the pages of new tasks compared to the daily progress of that bar. If these were bookmarked with rubber bands, one would like the stack in between to be fairly stable in size.<br><br>I have also tried to make the "current task" highly visible. Instead of Mark's dot technique, I am using a large open circle at the left of the line. When it is done I draw a line to the right from the circumference. The next morning I can easily see all the open circles (with lines attached) to count them for the daily total. I extend those lines to the left through the circle after the count (perhaps, to accomplish your statistical approach, I should put the date inside the circle instead) . I also use Marks technique of connecting adjacent done task circles (instead of dots) with vertical lines. I find all this helps a lot but takes up some precious left hand margin space. I do miss using my PDA but the fact is it is slower so to do, and is prone to the regular foibles which, though generally easily solved, take up further time.<br><br>Jacqueline: I am just seeing AF2 as Mark's carefully reasoned successor to AF1, it's not perfect yet, but looking at my notebook, the crossing through of tasks is fairly uniform throughout, while AF1 never really got going for me properly, though I did expect (hope) that it would eventually!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 July 2009 at 17:56 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Laurence: apart from being useful for any statistics you collect, noting the date an item is actioned (or dismissed) can also be useful if you - or a boss/co-worker! - ever want to know "when did you do X?", or "what did you do on Tuesday?".<br><br>I used to use various circles, etc, but have now simplified it to the following:<br>I use the vertical line, just to the left of the margin (with a little visible space in between), to mark the current task. When it's actioned I then add the date (just "d/m", no year to save space) in the margin (to the left of the vertical line) and cross-out the item starting from the vertical line.<br><br>I actually use 3 different style of crossing-out to distinguish fully completed (straight horizontal line), partialy completed and re-added at end (wavy line) and cancelled/deleted (i.e. decided I never wanted to do the task or it wasn't relevant/possible anymore, but didn't actually "do" anything - a series of slashes - "///" - along the length of the text). Again, certainly not necessary, but slight chance it might be useful info every now and then and takes essentially no extra effort.<br><br>I do find the date vs blank space comparison alone a pretty good way to quickly scan for open items, so in your small notebook perhaps that could be a minimalist solution (i.e. just that, as small as you can legibly write dates, and the actual strike-through as the only markings) - especially if you could incorporate a useful current task marker, perhaps by using a slash that'll then become the day/month separator when it's completed?<br><br>In terms of finding space for stats: if you don't use both sides of the page then the "facing page" is a good place for them (I use it for this and for notes related to any of the items). Alternatively, you could "give up" one line to mark the start of each day (indicating the entry date of the items below it until the next such separator) and use the rest of that line to record some stats... e.g "22/7 ----- 10A/1D, 12N, 70T, ..." could indicate "following items entered on 22nd July, stats for 21st July were 10 items actioned and 1 dismissed, 12 new items added, 70 items open, ..."<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 July 2009 at 15:15 | SteveB</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>...and a bit more!<br>Two fairly long posts - what's that old saying, "If I'd had the time I'd have written a shorter letter"? {must try harder to be concise!}<br><br>When you said:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; "...compare the rate of passage through the pages of new tasks compared to the daily progress of that bar. If these were bookmarked with rubber bands, one would like the stack in between to be fairly stable in size." &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>... that's the intended concept behind my measures 4, 5 &amp; 6 (above). I think you'd still want the total number of open items as well (in fact that may still be the "primary" metric), else you're not acknowledging the difference between 10% or 90% of the items in that 'stack' having been completed!<br><br>I'm still leaning towards the age of the oldest open task as becoming my second key metric after total open items, because of the way it works with AF2's inexorably advancing dismissal line: it tells me "any item will be dismissed if I've done *nothing* towards it for X days". (where X varies slightly over time, but hopefully within a stable range as you say)<br><br>Like you seem to, I'm really appreciating the effect of having only a certain timeframe within which to take some action (even if only a little) or else dismiss the task - i.e. admit I'm not going to do it, at least for the moment.<br><br>It also relates directly to the question I try to ask myself if I ever have anxiety about dismissing something that I think still "must" be done: "I've done nothing on this for X days, why on earth should I think I'd do anything towards it in the next X days either?!".<br><br>~ If the answer to that is because I couldn't have started it yet, then it should have gone (and should now go) into the calendar or tickler list for a future reminder;<br>~ if it's because it needs a very specific "context" then I should probably have a separate list for that (like an errands/shopping list) or else schedule a specific time for it;<br>~ if it's because it's dependent on something then I should rephrase it as the relevant "waiting for" task &amp;/or follow-up action;<br>~ etc...<br>(default option is, of course, just dismiss it and see if it ever comes back via the "review dismissed items" task!)<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 July 2009 at 15:18 | SteveB</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The way I keep stats is:<br><br>1) Write the date (ie. today 22/7 - I suppose Americans would put 7/22) at the extreme left hand edge of the page next to the first item I enter each day.<br><br>2) At the beginning of each day I put the previous day number only (i.e. today 21) in the left-hand margin against every item that doesn't already have a day number against it. That takes only a minute or so and gives a great sense of achievement as I appreciate just how much I did the day before. Only if an item has been on the list for over a month would I put the month as well as the day.<br><br>These two metrics allow me to extract easily such things as how many days on average tasks remain on the list, how evenly spread over the list the items are that I action during a day and so on.<br><br>I think I'll take a photo of a page spread tomorrow and put it on the blog.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 July 2009 at 18:32 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
