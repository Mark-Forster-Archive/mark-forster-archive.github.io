It's the difference between Halvorson's two types of goal, which I've described at least twice during this discussion.<br><br>&lt;&lt; If I were aiming to become a cook I'd dig much more in techniques, traditions, physics ecc. &gt;&gt;<br><br>That wasn't my question.

Gaining a healthier balance to buy both a couch and a new fridge may make for a better house, but may be contrary to a person's desires, in the bigger picture.  Maybe focusing more on people than work will be better.<br><br>Which brings me back to the idea that you can't perfect everything.  You can merely "aim for perfection" to the extent you allot time and effort to each goal.  More emphasis should be given to greater goals.<br><br>The other question is the approach to achieving it.  I suspect your practice of pursuing perfection might fit my notion of imperfectionism, as I suppose perfection isn't always achieved, and pursuit isn't always endless.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 October 2011 at 23:13 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Having all the required or desirable elements, qualities or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be".<br><br>Required by whom and for what purpose?<br><br>As Alan has said, the specifics vary from one person to another, and from one context to another.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 October 2011 at 23:26 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; Using the dictionary definition of perfect above, what are the "required or desirable elements, qualities or characteristics" of these emails?

In this perspective, I think cooking is one of the things that I really do for myself, so it should not change nothing (but off course I'm prone to perfecting furtherly :) )<br>But there are other fields where I probably should meditate more on this difference.<br>Just to complicate a bit things I can add an ingredient to the formula that keeps people from making things just for themselfves. And that is market. Market can be "others" and if you're trying to sell something or yourself to the market, this activity should match with your aim of perfection too. But that wouldn't prevent your need to "show off" your skills in order to get work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 October 2011 at 12:11 | Lorenzo</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Webster has a different definition of perfect:<br>"having no defect or fault; flawless; accurate; absolute."<br><br>That aside, and sticking with Oxford, you said: "your greater goals are going to suffer as a result of everything you don't perfect". Some things undone indeed will hinder your efforts, but surely not everything or even most. How strong can you make your case?  My claim is "greater goals are going to suffer as a result of time spent perfecting".  Evidently you agree in the example of the skier. So how do you define the line?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 October 2011 at 13:14 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think I must interject. Webster's meaning rings much closer to my casual use of the word perfect. It is certainly what I had in mind when I started the discussion. And despite knowing Mark was following Oxford's definition, I always took that with a Webster slant of the extreme. Perfect is 100%.  Perhaps Mark was thinking strictly "exactly as desired" and thus "aim for perfect" meant merely "aim for what you want [desire]".  (Mark, can you affirm this intent?)  I can't argue against that.  I interpreted the phrase as "aim for the superlative". A room should be clean, thus a perfect room is absolutely clean.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 October 2011 at 13:51 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Edit: replace "desired" with "desirable" and "desire" with "believe desirable".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 October 2011 at 14:22 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>Let's get rid of the words "perfect" and "perfection" which are causing trouble because they are absolutes, and use the words "excellent" and "excellence" instead. <br><br>What I am saying is that the more excellent you can make your systems, procedures and working environment, the easier it will be to attain your important goals.

This leads to no end of trouble when setting goals, for an individual or a team.<br><br>I myself am a natural perfectionist of both kinds, though periodically I hear something like the "80/20 rule" and convince myself that I should embrace imperfection of both kinds. Of course this never works out, and with relief I revert to my original self, reveling in maximized efficiencies and matching margins. It's been my misfortune to have worked with some dyed-in-the-wool imperfectionists, who see themselves as artists at producing something just beyond junk, scoring extra style points the closer they sink to the level of junk without actually drooping under it (as if playing an inverted game of blackjack), or even releasing known junk with plans to disguise it or blame it on someone else. The creative energy that goes into these plans can be astounding, more than enough to have made bona fide non-junk from the start.<br><br>Sadly, discussions on perfectionism tend to follow the delightful chats I used to have with those people: shall we be pathological perfectionists, or junk artists? Even when the topic is developed with much more subtlety and common sense, rarely are we encouraged to be better than, say, an 80% guitar player while accepting worse than an 80% couch.<br><br>The issue is not whether to be perfect, but what is important to perfect. Teams should not be debating whether 80% is good enough. They should be clarifying their goal, and its purpose, and then aiming to hit it perfectly. There is something about those junk artists that does not want to be fettered by any such standard, as if they are happier to slither under any bar, no matter how high, than to climb over a much lower one.<br><br>All of this intersects at Mark's claim above: "There is obviously a limit beyond which [excellence in all things] is no longer cost effective, but it is a lot higher than most people take it."<br><br>Where is the cost-effective limit in organizing your receipts? Improving your professional skills? Cleaning your kitchen? Selecting a gift for your best friend of thirty years? Selecting a couch? What is the effect on your professional, creative life of feeling every relaxing moment interrupted by thoughts of, "Damn this lumpy couch!"?<br><br>The standard is not 100% in all things, but it is a lot higher than most people take it.<br><br>I used to write software for OCR (optical character recognition), in which we scan a document and attempt to convert it to a word processing file by teaching the computer to recognize all the letters visually. A success rate of 99% was considered quite poor, which often surprises newcomers and laymen. But, considering that an average English word contains 6 or 7 letters, and a 99% success rate means a 1% error rate, we are talking about one word in fifteen misspelled, which yields a pretty horrible-looking document. How many misspellings are acceptable, and why? One per sentence, one per page, one per document ... That is the difference between 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, ...<br><br>The standard is not 100% in all things, but it is a lot higher than most people take it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 October 2011 at 18:58 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie:<br>I use 80/20 not in the way to do all my stuff at 20% effort for 80% results.<br>I use it as I do 20% of my stuff at close to 100% and leave the rest.<br><br>A more realistic way to see it is:<br>I do 20% of my stuff at 80% effort giving excellent result.<br>And do the rest of my stuff (the 80% left) at 20% effort giving me good enough results (80%).<br><br>Hope it's not too confusing.<br>It's like Mark says, do the right things well.<br>And if you can VERY well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2011 at 6:01 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great thread to have joined. Thank you all for contributions.<br>I would just report this phrase that I think I didn't hear of from when I was young. Saturday  I found my father that was hammering some nails to a wall; I looked better, and he was using a "rollable meter" (don't know the exact word, it's the type that masons use, the heavy metallic-cased ones) to hammer the nails. I asked him why, and he just said: "My father used to say, if you haven't a dog, go hunting with the cat."<br>I think that this phrase can be used to link in this discussion the two types of "perfectionists" thta we finally isolated: the one aiming for excellence and the pathologic one that wastes his time.<br>What I'm trying to say is that in the pursue of perfection, we should always consider which resources we have *at this time*. Just because a better way of doing something exists, it doesn't mean we can't work out things perfectly without it. And then, we can always enter a "buy a hammer" in our list for the next time, depending on how many nails we have to hang. Do you agree?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 October 2011 at 12:10 | Lorenzo</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>New thesis. Excellence is a state of mind, a broad goal. Pursuing excellence via AutoFocus may be difficult while one is struggling to escape overwhelm and procrastination.  But if things are under control, it seem good to raise your game by pursuing excellence. I suspect this ought to be done incrementally by picking one thing after another to direct towards excellence.  <br><br>Excellent results do not often come by fixing poor work (though that is possible).  They come more by intending an excellent result from the beginning. This may require rethinking the approach. It might suggest dropping some unimportant distraction.  It does not preclude working in many small increments, but it might entail concerted thought before the start to establish the best route to success.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 October 2011 at 12:25 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;Do you agree?&gt;&gt;<br><br>I agree Lorenzo, your story brings to mind the following quote: <br><br>Do what you can, with what you have, where you are~ Theodore Roosevelt<br><br>I think that procrastination often resides in the nebulae between the resources you have and those that you desire to get the task moving.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2011 at 4:38 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;I think that procrastination often resides in the nebulae between the resources you have and those that you desire to get the task moving.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Precisely! And that often gives the right justification for not even start that task (as someone else mentioned in this thread). More often then with material tools, I experience this with skills: I preclude me from doing something thinking "before doing this I have to improve". But to improve one have to do the thing (and possibly make mistakes).<br>Could be cool to explore all the places procrastination resides. That could worth a new thread to me. Different people have different strategies about that, and it should be very useful to know about them all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2011 at 10:38 | Lorenzo</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So, imperfection is fine when you're saving resources toward something more worthwhile, yes?<br><br>Procrastination is when you're not deploying resources in a timely manner as you should be?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2011 at 11:31 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Most cases of procrastination are where you really have the resources to do something, but don't believe or feel that you do.

But this is not procrastination, not saving resources.  It's expending resources in another direction.  Spending time to rest when needed is a deliberate choice not connected to procrastination nor imperfection.<br><br>Maybe instead of "saving", we should say "allocating" time and energy.
