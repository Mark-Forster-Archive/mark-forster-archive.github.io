My line of work is the performing arts, and I have come to realise that the only viable way to soley live off my art is to produce work for myself and  master being self - employed (unfortunately this is not taught at drama school!).  I already have a number of seemingly successful projects on the go - but what I have discovered is that it is essential to have many fingers in many pies financially.  I just can't seem to make this work as well in reality without getting stressed and having that ongoing sense of 'never finishing.' I can't remember the last time I actually gave myself a day 'off' and dinner gets later and later each evening, as does my bedtime.<br><br>I recently came upon Mark's Get Everything Done book.  I have been working with it and the suggested techniques now for 3 weeks and am making considerable progress in all aspects of my life.  I think I still have to pursue it for a while longer to see if these things will stick, but I am feeling very positive to say the least, and have lots of friends buying it too - Thank you Mark!<br><br>My biggest difficulty that I have still not fathomed is the concept of 'not' scheduling.  I have read pages 63-64 numerous times, and just feel like there's an idea there alluding me! How do you set aside a time to do one project and not the others? The percentages exercises have helped me immensely work out how much energy I should be /want to be giving to each project, then I had an overly complicated maths session trying to work out those %s into hours in my ideal working week.  It hasn't worked. I'm still working all the time on everything even though it is now in a much more efficient, productive and satisfying way.<br><br>Any advice?<br><br>Thank you<br>Adele</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 20:25 | Adele Bates</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Adele. <br><br>I'm self-employed as well and find it very hard - barring external time commitments i.e. clients booked - to stick to self-imposed "work on this project" goals. However AF has helped (when I'm disciplined enough to work from my lists). I let my intuition (and that could be fear, guilt, resistance) drive me towards the project that needs working on. <br><br>Any other self-employed or solopreneurs want to pipe in?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 21:27 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am self employed too, but as I am just a beginner I am also on a steep learning curve.  Hopefully we can all learn together.  I have not read the book you mentioned (I have that and the Do It Yesterday on order), but have read a lot on this forum and also I read all the Autofocus info (see AutoFocus System at the top of the page - click on it for further info if you haven't already). <br><br>I've managed to get as far as listing most of my tasks - just have some more to add.  I'm jsut intrigued about the new DIT2 Mark is working on - I have some time specific tasks which may work better with that system.<br><br>It's odd really, I believe that one of the biggest challenges of self employed people is being motivated.  However I have no problem allocated most of my life to work, but I struggle to discipline myself to follow a good time management system.  It did occur to me recently that I had a very regimented childhood and when I first became responsible for my own time I made a point of not having habits and rituals.  However I am now in middle age and realise I have been far too much the other way - to the extent that I have made life difficult for myself and I feel out of control and badly organised.<br><br>To this end I am setting up some habits that I plan to use to make life easier.<br><br>I guess my message is that it helps if you can do the same. It may be wise to try more than one of Mark's suggested systems to see which suits you best in your new way of life.<br><br>Anyway - congratulations on becoming self employed - do post us a link to your website if you have one. I hope you are very successful and enjoy the freedom this will bring.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 21:53 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AutoFocus is a more recent invention of Mark's.  It drops the idea of assigning percentages and hours, replacing these with visibility and intuitive choosing of what to work on.  Still most of GED is still good.<br><br>I'm self-employed, but not solo.  I can't say I've mastered the subject of balancing efforts.  Not by a long shot.  However, putting projects onto my AutoFocus list is helping.  Autofocus gets you to put these projects on a list.  Following the AF process gets you to to repeatedly choose among them, and also prevents you from neglecting any.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 22:00 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison, good luck with "Do It YESTERDAY" :-D</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 22:01 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>He He - What a Freudian slip!
