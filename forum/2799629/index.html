I don't know how I missed this gem and his Dreams book which I read a few months ago. <br><br>I will publish Amazon reviews of both, but I want to say how brilliant I think they are. As someone who uses story to teach in my own writing, I was crazy about the fairy tale in GED. If you haven't read all of Mark's books, I suggest you make doing so a resolution. <br><br>Now on to the topic. I was most excited about using bursts in my work day because it addresses my primary problem: feeling like I'm neglecting important business and life areas as I attempt to focus on the "priorities."  With GED's burst approach, I can rotate through all these areas during the day. <br><br>When I gave it the first try, I didn't remember that I was supposed to have chosen specific task(s) for each area, after which I would be done and the time allotted to the area would be reset at 5. Instead, when a life area was ready for a timed burst, I scanned my digital to-do list for that area to see what I wanted to do. At the end of the day, I was in awe of how much I'd accomplished in multiple areas--including things I'd procrastinated doing for ages. <br><br>For my second attempt using bursts, I started where I'd left off with longer bursts and had preplanned tasks. I still accomplished a lot, but it wasn't as exciting. After reading through this forum, I realize why. I wasn't using an Autofocus approach to the tasks in each area anymore. It still worked, but I can see where it will eventually feel like a schedule of doing X minutes on preplanned tasks. I would likely burn out on it.<br><br>I am excited to revert to what I did at first, using an Autofocus approach to the task list in each area. Autofocus was the most addictive approach of Mark's for me. I will likely use a morning time block for writing going forward as I don't have resistance there. But everything else will be actioned in this way. If there's nothing more I want to do in a category on a pass, I'll skip it and drop it to the shortest timed burst.<br><br>If you're interested in trying something similar, I want to be clear that I have cut my commitments as GED recommends, and I'm working from a shorter "day" list for each area that I plan daily (not a master list). I noticed that when it came to personal categories, I used more of a Dreams approach where I didn't use the list every time. I just did what I felt like doing. In this way, those categories felt like breaks. When a family or home task interrupted me, I just counted it as an out-of-order burst for that category. <br><br>I'm also going to experiment with10-20-30 bursts that reset daily. I love that Mark gives us so many alternatives to try. That also reduces resistance to using this approach.<br><br>Blessings to you all!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 January 2025 at 21:22 | Melanie Wilson</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have read your post.  Thanks. <br>I read GED years ago, and I have used timeboxing regularly since then.  <br>In that book, as I remember, he gives several variations on how to use time limits. <br>But on this forum, he has given more from time to time. <br>It would good if all of these were collected, and put together, like the TM systems. <br>If you search the forum for "Timeboxing" you can find some threads. <br>There is a thread about "Micro Timeboxing - Forcing little and Often", where there is a post by Mark Forster in which he gives several variations. <br>Also search for "timed bursts"<br>There is a blog post "How to Crack a Difficult Task" where he gives another variation. <br>He has a post somewhere where he starts with 1 minute, and increases it by 1 minute, so 1,2,3,4, etc.<br>There are threads where others comment on GED, or come up with their own variations.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2025 at 3:11 | Mark H.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Mark H. Thank you! I did find some of these posts before I wrote, but not all. I agree that it would be great to have a collection of the variations. I’m thrilled with how my hybrid approach is working for me so far.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2025 at 21:02 | Melanie Wilson</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For what it's worth, I asked Perplexity.AI to summarize Mark's time bursts / time boxing methods, and it gave me this:<br><br><br>Mark Forster has developed several approaches to timed bursts and timeboxing, all designed to enhance productivity and overcome procrastination. Here's a comprehensive overview of his techniques:<br><br>## Increasing Burst Lengths<br><br>This method involves progressively longer work periods:<br>- Start with a 5-minute burst on a task<br>- Take a short 2-minute break<br>- Do a 10-minute burst<br>- Continue increasing by 5 minutes (15, 20, 25, etc.)<br><br><br>## Pyramid Method<br><br>A variation on increasing bursts:<br>- Work up from short to longer bursts (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5 minutes)<br>- Then work back down (5-4-3-2-1 minutes)<br><br><br>## Micro Timeboxing<br><br>Forster's "Micro Timeboxing - Forcing Little and Often" technique involves:<br>- Select 3-5 tasks to work on<br>- Set a timer for 5 minutes<br>- Work on each task for 5 minutes, with short breaks between<br>- Cycle through all tasks<br>- Take a longer break after completing a full cycle<br>- Start the next cycle, potentially with new tasks<br><br><br>## Flexible Timeboxing<br><br>Forster also recommends more adaptable approaches:<br>- Work on tasks for as long as you feel motivated, then switch<br>- Start with 1-minute on a task, then increase if desired<br>- Use timeboxing to get started, then continue if in flow<br><br><br>## How to Crack a Difficult Task<br><br>For challenging projects, Forster suggests:<br>1. Write down the task<br>2. Set a timer for 5 minutes<br>3. Work until the timer rings<br>4. Take a 1-2 minute break<br>5. Increase the time by 5 minutes<br>6. Repeat, each time increasing by 5 minutes<br><br><br>## Little and Often<br><br>This core principle underpins many of Forster's techniques, encouraging short, frequent work sessions rather than long, draining blocks.<br><br>These methods aim to overcome initial resistance, build momentum, and maintain consistent progress across multiple priorities. Forster emphasizes experimenting to find the approach that works best for each individual.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2025 at 23:37 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Fantastic idea to ask AI. I’ve not used Perplexity. <br><br>My approach of starting with a writing time block followed by 10-20-30 bursts choosing tasks from lists worked brilliantly for me. In the past I have tried theme days or assigning full hours to various areas and it did not work. <br><br>How are you, Seraphim?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 January 2025 at 2:20 | Melanie Wilson</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Melanie!<br><br>Glory to God, doing well, surfing the chaos. :)<br><br>Have two grandkids now!  <br><br>Nice to see you posting here!
