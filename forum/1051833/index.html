That's one of the errors that I made.<br><br>Well, I still haven't gotten around to learning VBA, but my 1-month deadline hasn't arrived yet. So, now I am going to give you a list of things that would be nice, but are not necessary. Since I still know very little about VBA, I have no idea how realistic these requests are.<br><br>I think that I learned from Mike the word "configurable." In the best of all possible worlds, I would like to see DWM for Excel made configurable. <br><br>I am making this request, because the tempo and pace of my work differ at home and at work. At home, I use the tool only on weekends. At work, I use it only on weekdays. The rigidity of the definitions of "week" and "month" do not mesh satisfactorily with my schedule. <br><br>I would like to be able to configure your tool. Accordingly I would like to specify how many days a "week" comprises and how many days a "month" comprises. <br><br>I can give examples of why this would help me, in another post, if anyone is interested.<br><br>Lastly, I would like to be able to configure the date format. I know that dd/mm has the benefit of logical consistency and near-universal acceptance, but in my backwards corner of the universe this format is jarring.<br><br>Right now, I modify your code to get these changes, and I do not mind continuing to do so. I just had the narcissistic notion that if I wanted to make these changes, others might want to make them as well.<br><br>On a less prosaic note, I am still finding DWM, in general, and DWM for Excel, specifically, the ne plus ultra of systems. Others have found that it leads them to focus on getting a lot of things done but not on getting the best things done. I am glad to say that, thus far, that has not been the case for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2010 at 13:16 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re: Changes.  When you make the changes I'd make the names "Entry" and "Reentry" rather than week and month as that would make things more logical.  Also, look into the options on Excel.  If it is ISO 9000 (?) compliant it should allow you to configure the date in Excel itself.  Check it out before making a change in VBA.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2010 at 13:22 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re: Configurable.  A programming tip from someone who did a lot of it and is happy to be not doing it any longer ;-)  Make almost EVERYTHING configurable to start with.  Simply hard code nothing, if you can manage it.  Even if, to start with only YOU set the variables in the program and don't allow the user to do so ... make them variables so that when you (inevitably) decide that they must be configurable, you'll be at least part way there.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2010 at 13:26 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh, and one more thing.  It is good programming practice for the following reason:<br><br>daysinweek=7<br>weeksinmonth=4<br>enter in today()+(weeksinmonth*daysinweek)<br><br>is self documenting where as simply using "7" or "4" or "28" or "30" in a formula leaves you guessing when you've (again, inevitably) forgotten what the hell you were trying to do in this section of code.  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2010 at 13:32 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi, all<br><br>I thought about making some options configurable, as was the case with my old AFx excel files.<br><br>I also wanted to play with the "month" and "week" values, to see what happens, for example, with a two weeks month, and a 3 days week.<br><br>It would be done on an additional worksheet ("Configuration"), with two columns, "Item" and "Value".<br><br>This could take a while. I'm suspecting that I'm using all this as an excuse to neglect my tasks ;-)<br><br>About programming practices, the code isn't all that pure.

They should go at the end of the 1-week day, but I'm finding that sometimes they are at the end of the day, sometimes at the beginning and sometimes in the middle. At least they are all so far on the right day, but it does have the effect of putting re-entered tasks in a different sequence to what I did them in. This could prevent my building up a routine of doing certain tasks each day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 April 2010 at 9:57 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi, Mark<br><br>For starters, I'm glad that you find it useful, and of course you can post it on your site.<br><br>About the bug, I see what you mean. I didn't think about it.<br><br>The explanation for this is that each task keeps their creation date/time also after reentering. <br>Then, if newer tasks fell under the same expiration date as the reentered one, they will be shown after it, because their creation date is newer.<br><br>As I wrote in the guide, this is on purpose. This way if lets say, I worked four times on a specific task, I can know how much total time I invested on it.<br><br>There are two workarounds for this:<br><br>- Keep both a “Created” column (fixed between sessions) and a new “Entered” column (that varies after reentering, and good for tracking).<br><br>- Create a new column, “Task Number”, generate it automatically, and keep it between sessions.<br><br>I'd appreciate to hear some feedback from the users about this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 April 2010 at 11:02 | Walter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There's a new version on its way, that includes the following changes:<br><br>- A configuration worksheet, including the requested month/week parameters, date and time format, and some colors (I hope I wont regret that last one). This was easier than I thought and it's mostly finished.<br><br>- More importantly, I almost finished a procedure that will automatically import every task from older versions of the file, when I post a new one. I guess this will make life easier.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 April 2010 at 11:05 | Walter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Walter:<br><br>Thanks for the explanation about the "bug".
