One of the changes resulting from this wave is the introduction of a "Daily Whiteboard", where the entire team gathers around a whiteboard for a 15 minute meeting ervery morning.<br><br>One of the key components of this whiteboard is a section where every team member is expected to write down the activities he's planning to work on that day. I initially expressed concern at this. As I was using AF1, as a rule I didn't know at the end of each day what exactly I'd be working on the next, even knowing that the system would see to it that the important things got done. So clearly this is a context that seems to be incompatible with any AF-style task management system.<br><br>Before adopting AF, I'd been using Do It Tomorrow (DIT) for a few years, almost since the book first came out, and I was very happy with it (although I like AF1 even better). Because of the next day focus of DIT, it seems a natural choice in my current context. So I purchased a new calendar (I use all Mark's systems on paper), and since my return from vacation last Monday, I've officially switched back to DIT.<br><br>However, I regularly add a task on my next day list called "AF list", in an attempt not to drop all activities that were being managed via my AF list. When working on this task, I temporarily switch back to modified AF1 mode: when I check off an unfinished item, I either add it back at the end of the AF list, or I write it down in my DIT diary for the next day.<br><br>Pending question for me is if I'll maintain an AF list in parallel like this (mainly for the smaller bits), or if this process will gradually clear all activity from the AF list and I'll be back to DIT only in a few days or weeks...<br><br>I'd welcome any observations, comments or suggestions on this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2010 at 13:06 | Marc (from Brussels)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Would it be simpler to use the AF list to pull things from and put into the DIT book, almost like a backlog?  Personally, I would want to get to following one system as it was intended, like DIT or AF as it is hard for me to determine the productivity of a hybrid system.<br><br>Also you said people are asked to write down what they are planning on working on that day, which seem very compatible with AF.  Could you just simply pick some of the items from your AF list as the ones you are planning to do that day and put them on the white board and then put a check mark next to them on the AF list so they get the needed focus.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2010 at 16:07 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Write down"?  Don't you guys like talking with each other?  :-)<br><br>My rule of thumb as an Agile and Lean software development coach is that each to-be-done task you bring up at the morning meeting should be something you estimate will take two or more hours to accomplish.  Otherwise, the tasks will be too fine-grained, and you'll spend the meeting telling everyone precisely how many pencils you intend to sharpen that day.<br><br>So that ends up being no more than four tasks discussed per person--probably more on the order of one or two tasks discussed for most people.<br><br>In that kind of situation, I would skim my AF1 list before the meeting and put paperclips next to any more-than-two-hour items I wanted to complete that day.  Then I would copy only those items onto the board for purposes of discussion, and just keep rocking my AF1 list from minute to minute through the day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2010 at 16:53 | Dan P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Dan, of course we talk. That's the point of the whole exercise. We're just required to update our list of activities for the day before the daily meeting where we discuss them. Also, we typically note down 3 to 5 activities, mostly representing one hour of work or more, or work to achieve an important milestone.<br><br>Both, making a selection from the AF list and marking these items to me seems to invalidate the whole AF1 approach, as it shortcircuits the mechanism where your intuition helps you choose what to do next. Working like this reduces the whole AF list to a kind of master to do list, which is something Mark warns against if I remember correctly.<br><br>Therefore, I feel DIT is more compatible, as there you build your list of activities for the next day during the current day. But the risk for  me is that this predetermined list will induce resistance and generate procrastination, which is something AF1 largely eliminated. On the other hand, as you publicly announce what you intend to achieve, this is a strong incentive to actually do it to avoid having to admit defeat during tomorrow's whiteboard meeting...<br><br>Finally, it occurred to me that I could handle the AF1 list as my DIT Current Initiative, meaning starting each day with a lapse of time working in AF1 fashion on the list.<br><br>But it's still early days (second week of back to DIT), so i'll see how things evolve.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 August 2010 at 13:01 | Marc (from Brussels)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm Looking for an answer to this. There's a fundamental issue of how to mesh a private list with team work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 August 2010 at 14:15 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would manage from my list.  If the team or a project has a list, my list would include review team/project list when needed and my lists would track the most important projects, actions and waiting for items I needed from various team members. <br><br>I manage several project which have their own lists which are typically reviewed on weekly calls.  When something needs my attention, I will put it onto one of my lists to make sure it is tracked more closely.  The individual project lists have lots of items coming and going all the time, many of which never make it to my list and are being done by various team members.  This approach keeps my list from ballooning out of control.<br><br>Gerry<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 August 2010 at 16:22 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Marc<br><br>How about before the meeting read through your AF list, close the list then pick the three or four tasks at the front of your mind.<br><br>Put these on the whiteboard, work on them, then return to working the AF list as normal.<br><br>When you come across them in the AF list, cross them out or rewrite them as required.<br><br>OK this is not strict AF, but it's hard to say you're not picking the tasks for the whiteboards intuitively.<br><br>Might be a disaster, but OTOH it might work well, so worth a try?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 August 2010 at 19:05 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Try asking yourself "If the day is average (or just a bit better), which tasks do I expect I'll do?" when you review your list before the meeting.<br><br>Are you allowed to add things to the list as the day goes on, like two hours solving an urgent problem?<br><br>What about the occasional "Clear 10 small items in 2 hours."<br><br>Think about the goal of the whiteboard and the new system as a whole. Chances are the boss is implementing a system he doesn't yet fully understand. It's easy to focus on the system rather than results at that stage. Is it to embarrass people into finishing things (which will backfire), or help people select priorities and stay focused -- something you already do using DIT and AF.<br><br>Did a book come with the new system? It might be worth reading. You will probably pull different ideas from it than your boss did. Think about how your current system addresses the same things, and if the new system addresses anything your current system lacks. I suspect the meetings will do things for the group that each member doing DIT in isolation can't do.<br><br>I suspect the two systems will be complementary.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 August 2010 at 16:47 | Cricket</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
