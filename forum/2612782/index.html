Write down a task you want to do. <br>2. Ask yourself "Is there anything I want to do first?"<br>3. Write that down on the next line.<br>4. Repeat the process until you get no answer to the question.<br>5. Do the end task on the list.<br>6. Before you do the next task (i.e. the last active task remaining on the list), ask the question again and repeat as above until you get no answer to the question.<br>7. Continue this process until there are no active tasks left on the list. Write down another task you want to do and start the whole process again.<br><br>Repeat ad infinitum.<br><br>POINTS TO NOTE<br><br>1) It's perfectly ok for there to be no answer to the question when you've written down the first task. In this case just do the first task and then write down another one. If this results in writing down tasks one by one and doing them immediately, that's fine.<br><br>2) You can build up to a difficult task by entering it as the first task and then gradually working back to it. This is quite an effective technique for getting moving on something. When deciding what to write as your new first task, it's a good thing (though not compulsory) to select relatively difficult and/or important tasks. The more trivial tasks will get done as "fillers".<br><br>3) It's good to end the working day with no tasks remaining on your list. So try and select the tasks you write down towards the end of the day with this in mind.<br><br>A good method with "No List" FVP is to start the list initially with the three or four major tasks/projects that you want to take action on during the day. You need to make sure that they are in the reverse order to that in which you want to do them.<br><br>Doing this gives a lot of focus to the day. It ensures that the major projects get done, while routine stuff fits into the gaps between them.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2523093">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2523093</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 June 2016 at 2:55 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One Day FVP<br><br>1.

Write a task down and do it immediately. This is the only way a task can be entered on the list. You can only do this when you are on the last page of the list.<br><br>2. If it is a recurrent task or one that needs more work it can be crossed out once it has been worked on and then re-entered at the end of the list.<br><br>3. The list is worked in the normal Autofocus fashion, that is to say you circulate through one page at a time doing as much work as you want to on the tasks on the page. Once you have worked on a task it is crossed out and re-entered as in rule 2.<br><br>4. Once a task has been put on the list it remains there until it is no longer relevant or until it is removed by the dismissal process.<br><br>5. The dismissal process is different from Autofocus. There is no obligation to do any tasks when you circulate to a page, but if no tasks are done on a page during the course of a day then the whole page is dismissed. This is controlled by writing at the top of each page (except the last page) at the beginning of the day the number of active tasks on that page, and checking whether the same number of tasks remain at the end of the day. In practice this only needs to be done for pages that stand some chance of being dismissed.<br><br>6. A page is dismissed by drawing a single line through the page. If there are no active tasks on earlier pages, then I cross out the page with a double line. Dismissed pages are not included when you circulate through the pages of the list.<br><br>7. A dismissed task can only be re-instated by treating it as a new task as in rule 1.<br><br><br>A Few Questions and Answers:<br><br>Question: <br><br>Why write it down when you have to do it immediately?<br>— Jens<br><br>Answers:<br><br>• Committing to the task by putting it in writing<br>• Reminder/Focus<br>• Creating a log of what you have done<br>• You build the list that way<br>— Andreas Maurer<br><br>Andreas has given an excellent answer, but in addition the main reason is to make you think about what you are going to do next rather than just drifting into it.<br>— Mark Forster<br><br><br>Question:<br><br>Is there an easy alternative to counting up the tasks as described in Rule 5?<br><br>Answer:<br><br>Yes. Though not as fool-proof as counting the tasks up and writing the count at the top of the page, an alternative is to use a dash instead:<br><br>1. At the start of each day, mark the top of each page (except the last page) with a dash: –<br><br>2. When you come to a page with a dash at the top and start a task on that page, cross through the dash to form a plus sign: + <br><br>– = The page has not been worked on today<br><br>+ = The page has been worked on today<br><br>It's best to join all the plus symbols together at the start of each day by crossing through them before adding your new dash mark: +–+–+<br><br>It's nice to be able to flip through the pages and quickly see which have not been activated yet today.<br>— Michael B.<br><br><br>Question:<br><br>I'm wondering about crossing out new tasks after working on them but not completing them.<br>— Will <br><br>Answer:<br><br>Try it out and see what happens.<br><br>I haven't tried it personally, but since an uncompleted task would remain on the same page you would only be able to move onto a new page by completing, or leaving until the next round, all the incomplete tasks.<br>— Mark Forster<br><br><br>Activefocus (No-List Autofocus):<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/3/29/no-list-and-autofocus.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/3/29/no-list-and-autofocus.html</a><br><br>2nd Day Report on Activefocus (No-List Autofocus):<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/3/30/2nd-day-report-on-no-list-autofocus.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/3/30/2nd-day-report-on-no-list-autofocus.html</a><br><br>3rd Day Report on Activefocus (No-List Autofocus):<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/3/31/3rd-day-report-on-no-list-autofocus.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/3/31/3rd-day-report-on-no-list-autofocus.html</a><br><br>Final Report on Activefocus (No-List Autofocus):<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/4/1/final-report-on-no-list-autofocus.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/4/1/final-report-on-no-list-autofocus.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 June 2016 at 22:29 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Activefocus (No-List Autofocus): March 31 Rules Update<br><br>The effect of these amendments is that progress through the list consists of three phases:<br><br>• Dismissing pages older than one day (on first pass only)<br><br>• Doing old tasks<br><br>• Entering new tasks <br><br>1. Write a task down and do it immediately. This is the only way a task can be entered on the list. You can only do this when you are on the last page of the list.<br><br>2. If it is a recurrent task or one that needs more work it can be crossed out once it has been worked on and then re-entered at the end of the list.<br><br>3. The list is worked in the normal Autofocus fashion, that is to say you circulate through one page at a time doing as much work as you want to on the tasks on the page. Once you have worked on a task it is crossed out and re-entered as in rule 2.<br><br>4. Once a task has been put on the list it remains there until it is no longer relevant or until it is removed by the dismissal process.<br><br>5. At the start of each day’s work all pages which were filled with tasks more than one day ago are dismissed, together with all the tasks remaining on them. This is controlled by dating each page as soon as it has been completely filled with tasks. For example a page which was filled with tasks on March 29th is dismissed at the start of work on March 31st.<br><br>6. A page is dismissed by drawing a single line through the page. If there are no active tasks on earlier pages, then I cross out the page with a double line. Dismissed pages are not included when you circulate through the pages of the list.<br><br>7. A dismissed task can only be re-instated by treating it as a new task as in rule 1.<br><br>8. When a new task is entered at the end of the list you are only allowed to move forward and can no longer circulate through the page. This means that entering new tasks becomes a separate phase from working on old tasks. You can enter as many new tasks as you like in accordance with Rule 1, but once you have entered all you want you return to the beginning of the active list.<br><br>9. At the beginning of each day you start by dismissing any pages under Rule 5, then proceed from the beginning of the first remaining page.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/3/31/3rd-day-report-on-no-list-autofocus.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/3/31/3rd-day-report-on-no-list-autofocus.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 June 2016 at 22:45 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The May 9 System<br><br>1.

You add a new task in the following circumstances only:<br><br>• There are no active tasks on the list OR<br>• The last active task on the list is the one that has just been re-entered.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/5/15/a-second-variation-on-my-no-list-system.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/5/15/a-second-variation-on-my-no-list-system.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 June 2016 at 22:51 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The June 1 System<br><br>1. The list is valid for one day only. The next day a new list is started from scratch.<br><br>2. Tasks can only be entered on the list by being done.<br><br>3. Tasks are re-entered at the end of the list if they are going to be needed again the same day (i.e. if there is still work to be done on them or they will recur again that day).<br><br>4. When you have entered as many new tasks as you want to, you scan the list from the beginning and work on any tasks that you want to.<br><br>5. When you reach the end of the list you can add new tasks again as in 2 above. When you have added as many as you want you start scanning again from the beginning of the list.<br><br>6. You should not feed the list from a larger list. Reminders of things that you intend to do at a specific time or date are fine.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/6/1/the-system-im-going-to-be-using-for-this-experiment.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/6/1/the-system-im-going-to-be-using-for-this-experiment.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 June 2016 at 22:53 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The May 9 System: June 7 Rules Update<br><br>If, I asked myself, a task can only get onto the list by being done, then perhaps it should only be able to get off the list by not being done.<br><br>So I’ve added the following rules to the May 9 System:<br><br>1. Whenever a task on the list has been worked on it must be re-entered, whether or not it is going to be needed again.<br><br>2. There is no compulsion to work on any re-entered task.<br><br>3.
