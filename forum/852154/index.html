Now having just sold our house and purchasing a new one, I have a load of tasks to deal with legal, financial, movers, school change etc etc. I don't want to overload the system but I want to stay true to the new AF. I would really appreciate some thoughts on ways in which I can handle this. I am not a great lover of separate lists to cross reference so any suggestions or considerations would be really helpful.<br><br>Thanks as ever to all.<br><br>Titch</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 August 2009 at 22:20 | titch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi titch<br><br>My suggestion would be to put everything into AF and see what happens.  The only proviso I would make is that, because RAF is more time sensitive than original AF, if something cannot be done before a specific time then I would add it to your schedule and only add it to your list once you are able to do it.  For example, if you need to make a doctor's appointment in a month's time, and their system does not allow booking for more than a week ahead, then I would use my schedule to remind me to add "make Doctor's appointment" into my list in three weeks time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 15:47 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts as always. I already run the schedule system you describe, and have done since AF1 to very good effect, so I shall continue with that. Once it comes up on my schedule I add it to my AF list.<br><br>I guess my concern really is around the volume aspect of all the tasks, but I shall put them all on and see what happens, it will actually be an interesting minor experiment of the system!<br><br>I'll keep you posted.<br><br>- Titch</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 20:04 | titch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi titch<br><br>Best of luck - will be interested to hear how you get on!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 August 2009 at 7:52 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Christine B and Mark<br><br>Hi Christine, I promised to let you know how this worked out. We are about three weeks from moving and i have kept all my move related tasks within RAF and it has worked brilliantly! I was as you know concerned about "system overload" but it has coped really well. As and when a task comes to mind or I receive documents or have calls to make to chase up etc, I add them to RAF list and they are getting done, no missed issues or deadlines. I have used a mix of phrasing on tasks such as straight "Do X" , "think about Y" , "review Z and "call A". I think this also helps by adding some clarity to the task and not making everything look a must do item (even though of course they are).<br><br>I support this through using a tickler file for those items where I have a time delay before needing to follow up, so they only get added to the RAF list if, when i review/action my tickler file for the day, I have not for some reason been able to complete it. This helps greatly with not having a lot of longer term items i.e. those more than 1 week out before they could be actioned and keeps the list churning.<br><br>I have also been particular about keeping all the related documents properly filed in ring binders so I can easily find items from, movers, bank, agents etc which saves hugely on stress levels and makes me feel very competent! It also suppots the list by then easily being able to go to the papers relating to an RAF item, makes Marks adage of "just get the file out" easier on days where I may be starting to feel overwhelmed.<br><br>So all in all a good report on using RAF for something as major as house, school and work moves, during 9 weeks of school holidays without the need for a separate detailed project plan, which itself is a revelation to me. You will be pleased to know I'm sure though, that I do still have a mind map as my initial - OK what's the job look like overall and what are all the connecting bits - at a high level, but as I break it down into tasks it goes straight into RAF and I don't go into detail on the mind map as i have done before, and it's worked great.<br><br>I'll update again as I stress test it some more over the next couple of weeks and we get to crunch time, but Mark, the system as you instruct it has delivered for me, Heartfelt thanks, no one can quite believe that I am in the midst of so much and still so calm!<br><br>With best wishes<br><br>Titch</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2009 at 7:42 | titch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Titch<br><br>Thanks for the update - it was a nice inspiring post to read first thing.<br><br>"which saves hugely on stress levels and makes me feel very competent"<br><br>I think this sums up exactly how I feel when I'm 'on AF' - I still have a tendency to slip off it some days but I'm getting better.  I love that feeling of competence so thanks for helping me recognise that I get from AF - if I keep reminding myself of that should motivate me to stay 'on list' more and more.<br><br>Good luck with the rest of the move,<br>Lucy</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2009 at 10:10 | Lucy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Titch<br><br>Glad to hear everything is going so well - there really is something almost magical about that feeling of regaining control, isn't there?  Your post gives a great summary of how the calender, reminder system and project files all work together so well with AF - together with the creative use of Mindmaps to overview things - definitely sounds like "my sorta system".:-)<br><br>Hope all goes well with the rest of your tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 15:12 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
