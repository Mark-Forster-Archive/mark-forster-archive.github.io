It puts a lot of attention on the older tasks -- which is good for completeness but less good for focus / responsiveness. <br><br>Serial No-List is the reverse -- lots of focus and responsiveness, but less attention on completeness. <br><br>I thought this variant on the Serial No-List idea might be a way to simplify the Serial No-List rules. But I am afraid it will have a Long List feel (and the Long List danger of being overloaded) and lose the No List feel (and all the interesting psychological benefits of No List). And Serial No-List is already quite simple anyway.<br><br>One thing I have found with Serial No-List. Even though it does not focus on completeness, it still generates a strong feeling of completeness, even closure. Older tasks and pages can hang around for awhile but it's almost like they SHOULD be hanging around for awhile. When they are finally cleared out it just feels RIGHT. And it happens faster than I expected it would.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2019 at 21:02 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>I look forward to trying it out.

By iterating over a small list of tasks until they are done, they get completed.  All those other things not on the small list may get discarded if not important, and thus they also are complete.  And the few things that remain, are important and will get activated, thus also getting completed.<br><br>Currently I'm of the opinion that (4) would be better as "from end to beginning".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 2:36 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>This is exactly what I was doing before this latest round of experiments! And by "exactly," I mean almost exactly reversed.<br><br>Just before my F-task method, I was scanning my Long List's last page up from the bottom, and if something on that page stood out, rescanning again from the bottom. When nothing on the page stood out, I continued the scan upwards through the whole list in one pass (same as Alan is suggesting above), working on whatever stood out. Upon reaching the top of the whole list, I restarted the whole process from the bottom.<br><br>This was a variation on Mark's and nuntym's AF2 tinkering, in which Mark was "locked" to each page in succession, and nuntym was locked to each day. I was locked only to the last page and then unlocked the whole rest of the list. What I loved about this was the opportunity to hammer the tasks at the bottom of the list, which led me to write an "F" in front of one "focus" task and make a game of keeping that task at the end of the list.<br><br>That was really great for me by itself, but as soon as I brought back my Day Page—which also is really great for me by itself and I don't want to give up—it split my focus and starved out the Long List... and here I am again!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 4:19 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The game changed for me with the rule that the open list is initially empty and filled by thought rather than first pulling forward tasks from above, even if only from yesterday.  Mark suggests this above, and I have tried that before. It seems to work fine but (so far) I greatly prefer starting with a blank slate and only later  going  back.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 13:31 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; The game changed for me with the rule that the open list is initially empty and filled by thought rather than first pulling forward tasks from above, even if only from yesterday. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, this is true for me, too. This is probably the main feature of the whole Serial No-List system. I think this is why I was resisting this variant. I think the variant would create a tendency to lean too much on the existing list items, rather than bring your intuition to the surface. Starting with a blank page is GREAT at bringing your intuition to the surface. This is what gives the system the No-List feel. Keeping the pages around till they are completed or deleted gives the system a sense of completeness that is missing with other No List systems.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 14:27 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>All you have to do is start a new page each day but otherwise use the exact same system. You can have a Serial No-List or a Long List, and you can change your mind each morning.<br><br>But do you even really need to flip the page? Nothing stops us from writing down everything on our minds into the Long List each day, with or without flipping the page or drawing a line. Who cares if it's already on the list somewhere up above? As David Allen says, if it's on your mind, you haven't handled it sufficiently. Maybe cover the prior list with another piece of paper while you get everything off your mind afresh.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 15:28 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;Nothing stops us from writing down everything on our minds into the Long List each day, with or without flipping the page or drawing a line.&gt;&gt;<br><br>True, but the simple action of starting a fresh page as the first action of the day has more than a trivial effect. It immediately prompts engagement with whatever is most important to you, most top of mind, most urgent. It gets you thinking. It gets you motivated. It starts you in a good direction for the whole day.<br><br>With Long List, the easiest thing to do when I open the notebook for the day is to start scanning. Perhaps the many forum discussions over the years on “where to start scanning at the beginning of the day?” is evidence of this?<br><br>Often, the scanning leads to the same result -- to the most engaging items that are really going to help you move things forward. But it can just as easily lead to distractions.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt;Maybe cover the prior list with another piece of paper while you get everything off your mind afresh.&gt;&gt;<br><br>It’s easier to start a new page. :-)<br><br>Honestly, I’ve tried all these ideas. I was resisting the idea of starting a new page, because there is something psychologically satisfying about having a single long unbroken list — seeing all those pages so neat and orderly and filled completely with crossed-our tasks. Maybe there are other benefits, too, such as the perception that it’s saving paper. But in the end, the simple trick of starting a new page has had quite a profound effect that seems much more valuable. At least, that’s how it has worked for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 21:55 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;As David Allen says, if it's on your mind, you haven't handled it sufficiently.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, David Allen says if you are worried about many things, have lots of mental clutter, "monkey mind", etc., then it's very difficult to respond appropriately to all the demands coming at you. But I am not sure how that applies to the discussion here. Writing whatever is on my mind on my list when I start the day is a great way to clear my mind of clutter, and be able to assess each thing appropriately, with full engagement and intuition. I think that's actually the same thing David Allen is trying to achieve with his GTD inbox-handling and weekly-review routines.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 21:59 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>"Writing whatever is on my mind on my list when I start the day is a great way to clear my mind of clutter, and be able to assess each thing appropriately, with full engagement and intuition."<br><br>Yes, that is what I mean. I am claiming that your No-List practice of writing a fresh list is in accord with David Allen's principle. You are handling what is on your mind by giving it a fresh place in your system, rather than hoping it will resurface from whatever past page it is lurking on. The fact that it is still on your mind suggests that you were not confident in the latter—easily fixed!<br><br>I like the fresh new page per day. It is such a simple enhancement, it could be applied to most any Long List system to gain No-List benefits with minimal disturbance.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 22:33 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>LOL, somehow I thought you were saying the opposite. Sorry for the misunderstanding!<br><br>&lt;&lt; I like the fresh new page per day. It is such a simple enhancement, it could be applied to most any Long List system to gain No-List benefits with minimal disturbance. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Hm, interesting idea! You may be right! I could see how it might integrate nicely with FVP, for example. Others, like FV and AF4, put more emphasis on older tasks, so I don't see how it would work with them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 23:17 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think the best time to scan the old items depends on how much you trust your intuition and how much time you have, which varies with person, job, and even with day or hour. <br><br>Sometimes I'm terrified I'll forget something important, so check it early. Other times I'm happy with intuition. Often it's a mix. I might start the day with intuition, but stay calm knowing that I'll check it with plenty of time if something's lurking. (That method should produce more anxiety than it does. All too often I get caught up in something and never check.)<br><br>I agree, a fresh page really makes a difference. I usually start by writing my routines, then check the calendar, then check the last few days' lists.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2019 at 17:00 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Two inchoate ideas that should probably have died aborning but what the heck, honor my impulse.<br><br>* The new blank page every day reminded me of Mark's love of "fill in the blank" sentence completions, where you come up with 10 new completions for a given prompt, and then attack the same prompt every day but write new completions without referring to the previous ones. The goal, I think, being both to generate new ideas and to see which ones are most persistent. For me, a new blank serial no-list page is "fill in the blank" to the max.<br><br>* The serial no-list experience I've had for the last week or so reminded of one of Mark's expressed preferences, that of "spaciousness" in his mind, schedule, life, etc. I've been involved the past month with a committee I'm on that's revising bylaws and covenants for our cohousing community. Lots of new and unexpected work comes up, so older items from my previous longlist do not come to mind. As I draft the new list each day, what comes to mind seems to be what I have "space" for that day. It's not just whatever is "top of mind"; it's also what I have space to do (mentally, energetically).<br><br>Sometimes the serial no-list contains items that I can only do little-and-often with; I'll try to at least "get the file out" with some of them. Sometimes that is enough for me to write it down again the next day. <br><br>Sometimes, for specific projects (we're currently downsizing our possessions), I may rapid-fire lots of tasks in a row. I know I won't be getting to them all today. But they're written down, so that's comforting and probably opens up some mental space for a new idea to pop in.<br><br>[I just noticed I'm using "sometimes" a lot -- wow :) . I've not been keeping strict records of this, so that's about as specific as I can get.]<br><br>I keep separate serial no-lists for home and workplace. I bring my personal list to work and keep it open on the desk beside me all day. At home, when I have only an hour or two at most to work on ongoing projects or tasks, I'll also jot down everything that's on my mind -- more than I can do in that time, often. I'm able to judge what's priority, what isn't, what feeds me, what doesn't, and so I'm OK with letting some of those things go. Rattling off a long list while facing very little time to get them done reminds me that I simply have taken on a lot or that some of these things...just aren't urgent right now. Letting go of them, even for an evening, is freeing. I think that feeling of being at peace with my decisions also creates space inside my noggin.<br><br>Sorry for the babblement.

Indeed, for your system I suggest to keep on dividing your tasks as you are doing now then just scan your list however you want.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2019 at 15:49 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark -<br><br>&lt;&lt; RAF is a system that bears some resemblance to your serial no-list, in that the aim is to list only what is immediately relevant. But it starts from the opposite perspective - by whittling down a long list rather than accumulating no-lists. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, I can see some similarities. <br><br>RAF focuses on the tasks from yesterday and today. Serial No-List focuses on tasks from today.<br><br>For earlier tasks, there are some significant differences:<br>-- RAF seems to want you to deal with them pretty quickly -- if I understand correctly, you make one pass through yesterday's and today's tasks, and then you must go deal with all the older tasks. Serial No-List has you cycle through the current tasks till nothing stands out, and only then takes you back to the older tasks. I prefer this method because it keeps you focused on the current work until you are naturally ready for a break.<br><br>-- RAF demands that you deal with the older tasks -- delete, do, or defer. Serial No-List doesn't demand you do anything at all; but in practice, most tasks are deleted, a few are done, and a few are deferred (by letting them stay on the list). So the effect is probably similar, but again the Serial No-List approach feels more natural. <br><br>-- I know from experience that sooner-or-later I would come to resist RAF's demands in how to handle the older tasks. But on the other hand, I have some lingering concerns that Serial No-Lists's uncleared pages might grow and become a kind of debt. It hasn't happened yet -- they seem to get cleared out pretty quickly without any pressure at all -- but if Serial No-List starts having problems, I am guessing it will be here. <br><br>I guess the question is -- How to ensure closure on the old tasks without actually applying *pressure* on the old tasks? The pressure creates resistance to the system. Even the pressure to defer everything to the calendar creates resistance (at least for me). But if the list of old tasks starts taking too long to review, that also creates resistance. It will be interesting to see how that plays out, and whether we can resolve this conflict.<br><br><br>Recurring tasks -- I'd be curious to know what tends to happen with these with RAF. Does RAF tend to accumulate them, as with most Long List systems? Or do they tend to naturally develop into routines, as with No-List systems? <br><br>Such a trivial thing as starting a new blank page every day seems to have a really significant effect, and seems to be the thing that creates the No-List feel of Serial No-List. I am wondering if RAF gets a similar effect, even though it operates like a Long List system.

The way you scan *is* the way you present tasks to yourself. (Isn't it?)  Maybe I just don't understand what you are trying to say.<br><br>It's absolutely a key element of Serial No-List to cycle on today's tasks till nothing stands out, and only then take an excursion back to old pages. I am repeatedly presenting to myself the most current, most top-of-mind work, the things I am already most engaged with. It builds momentum and reduces distractions. I think it's very important.<br><br>But for the excursion back to the old pages, it doesn't seem to matter a whole lot exactly how you read through them. It seems to be a bit more effective to go from most recent to oldest. But I don't hold myself to that. <br><br>Also, exactly how you cycle through today's tasks doesn't seem to matter. I usually just keep cycling around and around like it's a short Simple Scanning list. But sometimes I use an FVP algorithm, sometimes I circle things and draw arrows and write side notes, etc. It doesn't matter a whole lot. <br><br>So if that's what you meant, then I agree with you. :-)<br><br>But if you meant it doesn't matter which part of the list gets your repeated attention, and the dynamics behind that don't really matter, then I don't agree with you. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2019 at 16:48 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am excited to hear more considerations about RAF.

What I was trying to say was that my experience is pointing to the paramount importance of the visual presentation of the list, how the tasks are arranged and presented on paper or screen *before* scanning, compared to the processing of the list itself. The reason for this is that a well presented list gives the intuition relevant information in an unambiguous manner which (theoretically) results in better and faster intuitive decisions. On the other hand, focusing on how to process the list instead of on how the data is presented results not only in a more jumbled list which the intuition has to interpret first before making decisions, but also presens a possibility of forcing intuition to work in a way it will make it harder for it to do its job.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2019 at 18:11 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark Forster:<br><br>Sorry for the late reply, currently not home.<br><br>"The problem I have with this statement is that neither your Task Tracking system nor Seraphim's Serial No List system are actually Long List systems."<br><br>Very interesting, why would you consider my and Seraphim's systems as not Long Lists systems?

With Long List systems, the recurring tasks tend to stay on the Long List, and are NOT done automatically. It doesn't HAVE to be that way, but that seems to be the typical experience.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2019 at 23:23 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; Slow speed and low volume then? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Of course not. <br><br>I want to quickly grasp the totality of my situation, discover where I need to focus, and generate the outcomes I want. <br><br>Yes, I want speed, but speed in repeating that cycle as quickly as possible, not to process as many tasks as quickly as possible.<br><br>Yes, I want volume, but volume in the size of the impact and outcomes, not the number of tasks I process. <br><br>You seem to be saying that to get the things I am describing here, I need to be able to process as many tasks as possible as quickly as possible.

When I say High Speed High Volume I'm getting the impression that you think I mean rushing round a list of 400 tasks as quickly as possible regardless of whether the tasks are actually achieving anything useful or not.<br><br>This is almost precisely the opposite of what I am in fact doing. Currently I have 59 tasks on my Long List. They are all highly relevant and get actioned quickly without hanging around. Any tasks which get on the list and are not relevant get quickly weeded out. The speed is because I have stripped out all the normal time wasters (which does not mean that I have stripped out rest and entertainment).<br><br>One of the big time wasters is deciding which tasks to do out of the ones that have already been put on the list. The Long List system is designed to do that for you. A lot of the speed comes from this being built in. <br><br>So to sum up:<br><br>High Volume does not refer to the number of tasks on the list at any one time, but to the number of worthwhile projects which one is capable of processing.<br><br>HIgh Speed does not refer to rushing through the work without any regard to relevance or quality. It means that one's processing speed for relevant projects is high because resistance and time-wasting have been stripped out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2019 at 14:04 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well then, I am very glad we got that cleared up. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2019 at 19:40 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/2/7/natural-selection-changes-the-emphasis.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/2/7/natural-selection-changes-the-emphasis.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2019 at 21:25 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, I love that blog post. Excellent. This approach works great for me. <br><br>In the later post that I cited, <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/1/high-volume-high-speed-low-resistance.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/1/high-volume-high-speed-low-resistance.html</a> , you seemed to be taking a different approach, leaning more toward the "Get it all done" side. <br><br>I remember when I first read that "high volume, high speed" post, I wondered whether you were speaking in hyperbole, or really meant "get it ALL done". I remember thinking it felt like a change of mode from the "Natural Selection of Tasks". <br><br>For example:<br>&lt;&lt; The aim of this method is to enable you to do *anything* and *everything*, with minimum resistance. &gt;&gt;<br><br>&lt;&lt; Since my expience so far with this system is that just about every task gets worked on during the course of the day, it doesn't really matter much what order you do them in. &gt;&gt;<br><br><br>(The method you were testing at the time was eventually revealed to be Real Autofocus.)<br><br><br>Anyway, I think this discussion we've been having finally clarifies it for me. Thanks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2019 at 22:56 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Going back to Mark's comments last week.  Yes, those quarters.  The only things on your list should be things you need/intend to do.  And you don't automatically know the value of every task without looking at it.<br><br>I agree with these points you make, but reject those ideas being near the conclusion of the matter.  I more and more strongly believe that there simply are things that are more valuable and things less valuable, and it is incumbent on you to figure out the difference and choose to keep valuable things. <br><br>It is also not correct to reduce the decision to yes or no.  There are levels of quality to your tasks, and frequency and intensity.  For me, while there are myriad household tasks I can spend my time on, I am choosing to devote more time to business projects.  Household work won't be undone, but it will be done less.  And further I can choose how I do these tasks and choose things that are more efficient over less.  E.g. I have settled on focused reorganizing and reducing mess over routine cleaning as a priority activity.  If this is successful, I expect future cleaning will take much less time, and future activity will also take less time (getting started, cleaning up).  <br><br>To abbreviate, it is much more valuable to think carefully about the tasks you take on than it is to do the tasks.  Organizing the tasks is not nearly so important.  Simple scanning will handle your list of tasks just fine.<br><br>So far I feel this serial no-list is helping me to think more about what I do and how, where a long list system just had me reacting to seeing routines and doing them.  Thinking is better.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 February 2019 at 2:44 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan: your comment resonated with me. We can't solve our little productivity problems at the level of new methods or new techniques. You don't solve the problem at that level. You go up a level or three to see the thinking that is causing the problem, learn from it, and then the downstream problem gets swept away.<br><br>But certain techniques, like serial no-list, can be aids to thinking about our mindsets if we approach them that way. I *could* feel guilty about not vacuuming the house more often, but my no-lists are showing me that I'm simply in a very busy period of work and life right now, I have finite attention/energy/focus, and tasks such as vacuuming are a low priorities.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 February 2019 at 15:27 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"It is also not correct to reduce the decision to yes or no. There are levels of quality to your tasks, and frequency and intensity." Alan<br><br>It's more complex than that. The importance and urgency of some tasks is affected by other tasks. If I decide to repave the driveway this summer, than putting sealant on it this spring becomes much less important. Researching paving companies in time to get the work done becomes very important.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 February 2019 at 22:12 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thinking more, it also depends on what else is happening. Normally, I buy food at the grocery store and cook it. It's a little healthier, and cost a lot less than going out. If I'm really busy then saving time or forcing myself out of the house is more important, so I'll spend more money and eat out. Vacuuming the house is important because it keeps our home comfortable, it becomes more important before my in-laws visit, or after a mess is made, and less important if I'm temporarily busy with other things.<br><br>If it's a short-term busy with other things, I will make different decisions then if it's something long-term. If you expensive meals out for a one week crunch is different than always eating out because I'm always too busy to cook.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2019 at 14:29 | Cricket</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
