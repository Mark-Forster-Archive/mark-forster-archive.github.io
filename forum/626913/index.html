IOW, I don't think it makes sense to dismiss a partial page.  It will work itself out, it seems to me.  On the next pass or two of the entire list, probably enough new things will have been added to the bottom that the page will be filled and then ... problem solved.<br><br>I guess there should be a new "rule" to cover that in the instructions.  Maybe it was covered and I did not notice.<br><br>If you work on some items but don't complete them, the rule says cross them off and add them to the bottom.  I think that still applies.  However, if it is the LAST item on the last page ... then I think it is silly to slavishly follow that rule.  Personally, I'd just skip it and go back to the top of the fist page.  Things will take care of themselves.  Personally, I think the "common sense rule" applies here.  Wild horses could not get me to cross of the last item on the last page and write it over again on the next line ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 10:38 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Rick<br><br>No you don't work on the page until you have done everything in one sitting.  You work on the first items on the page "that stands out" i.e. that you feel like doing, then move on to the next items that "stands out".  Once no items stand out on that page (i.e. from an "I feel like doing this now" perspective as opposed to an "I should do this" prespective) then you move on to the next page.  Obviously from a common sense perpective if something need to be done now then do it now, but there are usually a lot less tasks with that real urgency than we think.<br><br>There have been a number of posts on this issue, as you seem to be new to this my best advice is to spend a little time reading through the forum.  I won't direct you to a specific post as you may well find that the forum answres questions you don't even know you have yet!  Good Luck!<br><br>Mike, I would have to disagree with you regarding the last item on a page.  I think you may be missing two important points about AF, firstly, that it works on a series of closed lists and is not one long list.  It does not matter where the item is on a page, whether it is the 1st, 5th 20th or last.  The page is a closed list and the item just a part of that "unit".  If you do not cross off an item that has actioned, albeit partially, then you are losing the ability to complete all doable items on that page which enables the system to reject any (and all!) remaining items.  Secondly AF works with our intuitive minds rather than our rational minds; yes common sense is vital but the system is set up in such a way that we are learning to do what "feels" right rather than what our previous rational approach has told us we "should" do. It is that very act of learning to recognise how we feel about something that eventually enables us to actually recognise the value of it's place in our lives (or not!!) Just try crossing that item off - I promise you it won't "feel" as bad as you think :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 12:15 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Rick has a point if he is referring to a recurring task that is crossed out as done on the last page.<br><br>For example, if the last item on the list is *clear emails* there is little point in crossing it out and writing it again on the next line.  However, if the task is the second last on the list or the third last on the list then there is probably some real value in writing it again.  So I would say keep it simple and always re-enter a recurring item even if it it is close to the end of the list or indeed even at the very end of the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 12:26 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Rick and others:<br><br>Actually the instructions are quite clear about this. You treat the last page (i.e. the one which you are still writing tasks on) like any other page, except that you don't dismiss any items on it. This is because the last page might only contain a few items, all of which were recent re-entries, and you wouldn't want to start on any of them again almost immediately.<br><br>Once you've done every item you want to on the last page, you start again on the first active page.<br><br>In spite of what Jim says, my practice is to cross off and re-enter an item, even if it is on the next line. This is because crossing off an item is an important psychological reward, and re-writing the item gives a feeling of progress.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 12:59 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>I think this begins to get into personalty type, as is being discussed in another thread.  An INTP, for example, would NEVER follow a rule just because it is a "rule".  It just runs counter to a deeply ingrained sense of self.  This is why GtD, as written, gave me so much trouble.  What if I don't want to use a labeler ... does the system fail?  What if I like hanging files ... does the system fail?  No, some things are essential to the system working and others not.<br><br>I get that some people fell a rush when they cross something off.  I usually have coffee on Sunday mornings at my neighbor's house.  We both work on our weekly reviews and the company is nice.  He is funny to watch.  He writes in his calendar with a 0.5mm mechanical pencil and when he draws a line, he uses a ruler.  Even when he crosses an item off of his TODO, he does it with a ruler.  We joke continually about OCD ;-)<br><br>I can get a rush crossing off an item, but when it comes down to writing it again on the next line, I just feel silly ... and that is a more important feeling than the rush I get from crossing it off.  So I guess it is one of those things that is unclear ... is it an essential part of the system (i.e. makes it WORK) or is it just a personal preference?  Clearly on any page but the last, and for the top items on the last page, I get it.  Moving the item is part of the process.  But to delete the last item and  add it to the list again as the last item ... well, that leaves things essentially unchanged so, in that case, it seems like following a rule just to follow a rule.<br><br>To me, the rule it conflicts with is "use common sense" ... which varies by individual, I guess.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 13:27 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't completely get the idea that creating extra work (ie crossing an item off and writing it again on the next line) is psychologically rewarding.

It is a different "thing".  It is still part of the project "buy car" but is a different task.

For example if I had "Clear Email" and "Reply to Comments" on the same page those two would be sufficient at the moment to keep me busy all day"!<br><br>Moving onward is part of the sifting process of AF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 14:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Dm:<br><br>Well ok, but if you have just spent 20 minutes clearing your email, just how much extra work is crossing out "Clear E-mail" and writing it down again?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 14:32 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks to everyone for their replies. <br><br>Intuitively I guess I was doing it right.  However it does bring to mind one problem with certain electronic solutions, including my own:  If, instead of crossing off an item and adding it to the bottom, you cut and paste, you haven't "added" a line to the page and therefore it will take longer for a page to fill.  Something to think about.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 14:49 | Rick</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've no problem with crossing out and rewriting if it goes on a different page - that changes something in the system.<br><br>I don't have to worry about getting stuck on the same page because I have too much new stuff coming in and I have to keep a certain pace of moving through pages to avoid not getting to things (so the next page starts to stand out more than other items on the page I'm on).<br><br>One of the big advantages of AF as a system is that it is conceptually simple and low overhead. I just don't want to add any extra work (however limited) that isn't needed; 'clear email' might be short, but some of my items will be quite a bit longer.<br><br>Of course, if the crossing out is rewarding for someone, then that makes it worth doing for them even if it is just a line lower.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 15:02 | Dm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Rick - Instead of cut and paste (^x, ^v), use copy and paste (^c, ^v) and you're adding lines.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2009 at 0:08 | topcat</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
