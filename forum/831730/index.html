I am definitely finding AF2 to be more efficient at letting items stand out for me, and for encouraging me to action older resisted tasks.  My statistics are as follows:<br><br>Statistics as at 30 June<br>Currently on Page 91 - 38 lines to a page.<br><br>Total no of items to date - 3451 <br>Completed - 3089 <br>% Completed - 89.51% <br><br>No of Active Pages - 59<br>No of Open Items - 362<br><br>Statistics as at 9 July<br>Currently on Page 95 - 38 lines to a page.<br><br>Total no of items to date - 3577 (3451)<br>Completed - 3280 (3089) <br>% Completed - 91.70%  (89.51%) <br><br>No of Active Pages - 60 (59)<br>No of Open Items - 297 (362)<br><br>Although my number of active pages has gone up by 1 I have closed 3 of my early pages and most pages now have only 2 or 3 items so I expect to see the number of pages reduce significantly.  I had not gone below 300 items since February and am really happy to have a completion rate over 90%!<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 July 2009 at 12:28 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>Just a short question, are you now using the close list method of AF2 that you mentioned before, or exactly the AF2 Mark suggested?<br>Coz after reading your previous post, I've decided to return to AF1. <br><br>John</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 July 2009 at 13:31 | John</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Christine, <br><br>So glad to see that you've got your mojo back! <br><br>Have you thought of switching back to AF1 for a couple of days - strictly according to the rules - no tandem stuff?  It seems to me that you would be able to close off about 40-50 pages pretty easily (more if you let go of any reluctance to dismiss). Maybe you'd add say, another 5 pages (full of new actions resulting from working on the older stuff), bringing you to a manageable 15-25 pages.  Wouldn't doing this eliminate any issues, therefore 'necessary' tweaks done with AF1 or AF2?  <br><br>I just can't get around the fact that what AF1 is VERY good at is forcing us occasionally (even regularly!) to do something that we're resisting, and AF2 can do that as well, albeit more slowly.  If your 50+ pages of 2-3 tasks are spread out on the page, it could take 4 months to get those items resolved - possibly much, much longer if one started declaring days as non-discretionary.   I don't see that as creating any kind of peace of mind.<br><br>Isn't that part of the beauty of the system?  To help us learn to buckle down once in awhile and get over our resistance to doing some things?  Or admitting to ourselves - hey, you haven't addressed this in 6 months - admit that you're not going to do it in the foreseeable future and move on.  <br><br>Create a separate mindmap of "things I have dismissed that I am not going to do or will do in a year or so."  :-)<br><br>I'm curious and hopeful to see your stats in 30-60 days.  I wish I could fly over there and help you close off those bloody pages!  Sorry to sound as if I'm not more supportive because I am, but I think my anxiety in seeing someone else's backlog is getting triggered again...  :-)<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 July 2009 at 14:31 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>How do you keep your statistics?

However, most of my pages now have very few items on them so it not really very different :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 18:37 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline<br><br>It was interesting reading your suggestion that I have no desire at all to return to AF1, if anything quite a resistance, because AF2 has highlighted where I was cheating the system without realising it.  I'm sorry my pages have stressed you out!!!!  :-)  If I look at the pages in AF1 mode I have a real resistance to the tasks but with AF2 the threat of dismissal is more real as it cannot be avoided.  It makes me see that the items are not that much of a problem and they are being cleared pretty easily. I take your point about closing pages but with AF2 my pages are reducing - my later pages have very few items outstanding and my middle pages are reducing.  The early pages are being cleared by doing or dismissing.<br><br>Mind you you'd be very welcome to fly over and help me clear those pages!!!! :-)<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 18:44 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jeff<br><br>If you'd like to email me at mail[at]meovoto[dot]co[dot]uk I'll be happy to send you the template for my stats spreadsheet.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 18:46 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jiru<br><br>Yes my lists do have repeating and partially completed and reentered tasks within them. I treat the statistics on the basis that I will generally be enetering the same "type" of items, therefore a percentage basis is a pretty good guide for me.  I think you get a feel for how productive you are (which for me I define as doing what I have scheduled to do i.e. by putting it on my list) because that is what, at any given point in time, is "important" to me.<br><br>If I spend the entire day on list without procrastinating then I feel very productive.  With all other system I struggled not to procrastinate. I think for me the key is in knowing that doing the tasks that genuinely need to be done is the bais of productivity.  If we are constantly beating ourselves up for doing what we feel is unimportant, which we subconsciously equate to unproductive, then we feel unproductive, even though those tasks may be essential.  With AF, seeing that I am achieving a clearup rate of around 90 of tasks is a real encouragement.  The relative importance is irrelevant if they genuinely need to be done - and if they don't then the system gets rid of them! <br><br>I think when you refer to your feeling of focus that is all you need - we know that we are being more focused and that we are achieving what we set out to as a result.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 19:00 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christian, <br><br>I've found the keeping of stats to be working for me, not against me.  But I just use them for keeping track of how long older pages have taken to close.  If it's over a certain number of days, it's time to buckle down on the older pages.  <br><br>Otherwise, I only monitor the number of active pages outstanding because I don't like to get over 15 absolute maximum, preferably around 7-10 to make movement through the system be as smooth as possible, yet with a lot of variety.  And just to see that there's about 75 completed pages since Jan. 5 is pretty darn motivating.<br><br>Christine, <br><br>Yes, I can see that AF2 would work better for you because it allows for moving more slowly and in a structured fashion on those older items.  It's funny how Mark has created  methods that work for us just because they match our psychology.  I found that too with AF condensed (which is similar to DIT to me).  I'm playing a game every day of trying to close off a page filled with everything that's important to me - yet because there's no obligation to finish it, I don't beat up on myself if I don't complete this "will do" list.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2009 at 13:48 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline<br><br>It's so true how we all relate to different aspects of the system/s.  I would expect to prefer the AF1 approach in that it give "me" the choice of what to dismiss but I clearly need the structure of AF2 telling me to "make a decision on these items today"!<br><br>I do think as well that the different systems will react differently to our own individual usage.  My pages do end up with a lot of single tasks scattered over many pages but that does not give me more than a vague desire to clear them and get them out of the way, whereas they become more of a driver for you.  At the same time I am much more reluctant to dismiss items than you are - something I think still need to address perhaps :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2009 at 14:28 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
