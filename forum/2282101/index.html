I realise it can just be whatever is on your mind, but I believe this can be enhanced by a deliberate use of "do nothing" time.<br><br>A constant state of doing can erode satisfaction, appreciation or joyfulness and peace. After all, we want holidays just to restore a focus on enjoyment and ease as our MITs.<br><br>So in light of my previous post I'd like to suggest a regular helping of "do nothing" minutes on the AF list, or use the randomiser in <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fungie.info/bell/#">http://www.fungie.info/bell/#</a> .Which (as I said in another post) is even nicer when combined with either <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/">http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/</a> or <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.radiobirdsong.com/">http://www.radiobirdsong.com/</a> . Or maybe <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://coffitivity.com/">http://coffitivity.com/</a> ? <br><br>Slowing down is a decision for time to let the mud settle to the bottom of the river and let a clear view return. After those few minutes allow yourself to produce the next AF list. This can be challenging; I am often reminded of all of the things that I am “supposed to be doing” or “should be doing” instead of being still. But the rewards are more tranquility, and perspective on the day which I deem as success in being myself. Advanced doing nothing requires actively relaxing your mind and body, and slow breathing. Ultimately mastery comes from doing nothing while in nature.<br><br>Doing nothing can be a waste of time, or it can be an art form. It can also invoke your internal moraliser who may call you an idler, sluggard, layabout, slacker; loafer.

You stated:<br><br>"But the rewards are more tranquility, and perspective on the day which I deem as success in being myself. Advanced doing nothing requires actively relaxing your mind and body, and slow breathing. Ultimately mastery comes from doing nothing while in nature."<br><br>Who sez?  Advanced doing nothing requires slow breathing?  That will occur naturally with practice.  It's not a requirement at all.  It becomes a natural occurrence with a relaxed mind with practice.<br><br>Ultimate mastery can occur in nature?  I think not.  It's lovely and supporting yet not a requirement.  Furthermore, using the word "ultimate mastery" and "advanced" mastery sound, frankly pretentious and erroneous.  Either you're blissfully engaged in detachment or you're not.  Of course, everybody perceives experiences differently.  Why do you feel the need to give confining rules and confining definitions to advice that is often otherwise good advice?  You offer much that has been helpful when you don't get in pedantic mode.  I'm still in awe of your revelation about dreading the 10th step.  That is one of the most powerful things I've learned on these forums.  If you had decided to attach silly rules and buzz words to it, I might have never learned from it.  Just saying...<br><br>This is intended more as a sincere suggestion than only a criticism. I'm sure that I'm not the only person who registers instant aversion when recognizing arbitrary rules and erroneous declarations.

I'm using the method on Wildmind.org. It has many similarities to Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, but is more accepting of a lower level of commitment. (20 minutes a day rather than 45.) There's a recommended sequence, and many, many options (along with advice to stick with each method for several sessions).<br><br>Sometimes it seems like doing nothing. You're certainly not doing anything visible. At the end, you don't have anything concrete to show for it, not even a moved bookmark or dead pixels. I haven't done it enough to say whether I'll get all the benefits that recent studies attribute to it.<br><br>One of the challenges is sitting down and doing it. It and music get pushed back more than any other routine activities. I think it's because they're just for me.<br><br>Thanks for the reminder to do that next! (Looking forward to next week. Not a lot of irregular events, so can rebuild routines.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2014 at 17:55 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Cricket<br>The greatest challenge for me was learning how to actually quiet my mind. I eventually honed the practice via long distance running.  I could never have guessed that running would help teach me that.  LOL!  Now I don't ask as much.  Chronic pain, especially severe spikes from my spinal cord, shatters it like a sledgehammer to glass.

It's kind of like asking, "Does joy come from up or from down?  from girls or from boys?  from wet or from dry?   from heat or from cold?"   If you are looking for joy in any of those places, then I don't think you'll find it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2014 at 20:31 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Cricket<br>That's convoluted logic.  It's human nature to sometimes complain or whine. It's also human nature to share joy.   You know that it's not the real issue.  It's a completely different issue when you're admonishing The Universe (or God) for such a trifling inconvenience.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2014 at 20:35 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim<br>LOL!  Also, I've found that joy is sometimes contextual. Joy is to be found while active and in repose alike.  I agree.  The seat of joy is internal which can be coaxed externally as well.  <br><br>""Does joy come from up or from down? from girls or from boys? from wet or from dry? from heat or from cold?"<br><br>LOL!  You do have a way with words...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2014 at 20:39 | learning as I go</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
