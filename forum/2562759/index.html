Today I am going further and tell you what happened to me since I applied the wonderfull MF system IE questioning. <br><br>Since I red MF book SPP I never realised how questioning system was important. Asking WHY and HOW about everything was not an habit for me. I learned that it was better to group stuff by subjects (GTD projects) and I thought it was better to make list about everything. All kind of lists. When I red MF book he said that I had to throw away every kind of list and he also said that QUESTIONNING was the heart of the system. This was a revolution for me.  Rationaly,  I thought that it was the worst thing I could do and I immediatly thought that I will be lost immediatly or quickly or so...<br><br>One night I was not sleeping and I thought about my organisation. I red MF notes about the book and I thought that finaly List was not the heart of the system. Questioning as MF said Was the core system. So I gave it a try. <br><br>I was not realy motivated but as every body here I try to improve my organisation and I thing that life is getting really complicated. The all system is mooving and it is more than a revolution. It a a complete change of all we have thought since. A new way is arriving wich shove all we have thank and thought since the last century. <br><br>So As I am more paper than digital I took a new A4 note book put the date on it in the midle and reported all subject one by one like and AF list using the questionning system. IE about a business what happened, WHY and HOW could I fix it. I did it without a real organisation thinking that I could real each paragraph one by one and day by day.<br><br>So my note book is on my table and each time I feel so I report my thinking about a subject. <br><br>The result is great. I see a real improvement on what I do. <br><br>Of course there are tasks and actions which are borning from these reflexion. They go in a special note book if they are relative to a project and if not in my FVP list (mostly the very next action) <br><br>I ave a better control on my stuff but most of all I do what must be done. <br><br>So thank you Mark for what you explained in your book about questioning. <br><br>Hope that's help<br><br>Kind regard to all and Merry christmas.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2015 at 12:28 | Jupiter123</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm doing something similar - one notebook for questioning and thinking, and another one for my FVP list.    I was combining them in a sort of free-form hybrid but that just made things messy.   The pages with thoughts and questioning turns into a big blob that is hard to process when I'm in the FVP flow.   It's much easier to process the questioning/thinking notebook (and capture actionable tasks into FVP) by doing the questioning/thinking separately.   This also helps keep the questioning/thinking more focused, without the distraction of the rest of my FVP list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2015 at 16:47 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I do The things differently but kept the idea. My real trouble is about FV wich doesnt work now with me. So I kept the note book for thinking and questionning as you perfectly explained. <br><br>Instead for my task I try 2 systems I use on the flow. <br>One is keeping all my tasks in Omnifocus classified by project. I use a few contexts which are <br><br>GOALS<br>WAITING FOR<br>NOW LIST<br>ERRANDS<br>TICKLER<br>SMB (someday may be)<br>REF (for references) <br><br>Then I have a perspective wich shows me only AVAILABLE STUFF. That's for the digital part. <br><br>I am now trying to extract from it some tasks on paper. I am still thinking how. But I will find <br>The idea is keeping a short actionable things (urgent and important things) work by projects one by one until I can't do anything else about it and then do the next one.  It will be a kind of Must do list.<br><br>On another list I guess I will report a check list of stuff I intend to do in a short while. A kind of wish to do list. <br><br>I am not sur it will work but I try. <br><br>Omnifocus is kept then like a FV list but ordered by projects which let me think about them one by one doing my DAILY and weekly review.<br><br>Hope this will work. I just try.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 December 2015 at 16:50 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim and Jupiter:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I'm doing something similar - one notebook for questioning and thinking, and another one for my FVP list &gt;&gt;<br><br>My notebook has become my inseparable companion, but like you I don't use it for time management lists - though I do occasionally use it for shorter lists like shopping lists.<br><br>The main rule is that I have no rules about what goes in it or how it's written. However I haven't quite kept to that because I found three things helped to get the most out of it:<br><br>1. I date the first entry of each day.<br><br>2. I number the pages as I go along.<br><br>3. I have an index at the back of the book for things I want to find again.<br><br>Apart from being a vehicle for thinking in writing, the book is a fascinating read for me because it shows me how my thinking, my interests and my priorities change over a period. Reading back in it is often a way of linking ideas together or resurrecting something I put aside. So far I haven't missed a day since I started it on 5 October this year - but there's no rule that I have to write something every day.<br><br>It would probably mean absolutely nothing to anyone else who looked through it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 December 2015 at 17:56 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"I date the first entry of each day"<br><br>I try to date everything I write down. It's surprising how often a date is all I need to recover the context (and thus the meaning) of some cryptic scribble on the back of an envelope.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 December 2015 at 13:05 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will:<br><br>Yes, I learned long ago that everything should be dated with day, month and YEAR - however ephemeral it seems to be. It's surprising how often the year turns out to be the clue. I also spell the month rather than number it in order to avoid confusion with the American practice.<br><br>The way I was taught to do it in the Army is the best, e.g. 18 Dec 15.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 December 2015 at 13:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
