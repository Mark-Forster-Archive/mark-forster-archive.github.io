Why not just leave it where it is on the list until it is completed. I could see rewriting it on daily pages but AF4 isn't daily.  My list is weekly so I only write things once a week.  ....just curious about why it needs to be rewritten unless it's up for review.  Otherwise you could work on it, scan the list(s) following the rules and revisit it without all the lengthy rewrites. What's the advantage I'm not seeing?<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 September 2009 at 2:56 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Learning,<br><br>If you just left it there and moved on, then following the AF4 rules you wouldn't see that task again till you came to the end of your Open List ("Active List"), then completed at least one cycle through your Closed List ("Backlog"), and then worked through your Open List again till you came to that task again.  <br><br>The net result is you'd have large gaps of time between each "little and often" iteration on that task.  So, it would probably morph into "little and occasionally".<br><br>By crossing out the item and adding it to the end again, you will be sure to see that item at least one more time before coming to the end of the Open List.  This gives you the ability to push forward several different projects all at the same time, and _keep_ pushing them forward as long as urgency demands it.  <br><br>Hope that helps clarify ...  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 September 2009 at 3:28 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim<br>aaahhh...now I see!  Thank you!  IOW, the rewrites gives you opportunities to keep working on those tasks.  It's sort of pacing your more urgent stuff to completion without having the revisit the less relevant tasks for the meanwhile.  That makes sense.  You've also revealed to me why the lists are so long!  One large task could be dozens of rewrites...IOW, sometimes tasks on the list are units of action toward completion.  <br>I don't do AF but, I sometimes list 3 or 4 tasks that I work on in a round robin rotation....sort of similar to the idea behind the rewrites.  I do this for either onerous tasks or I do this to use less taxing tasks as breaks from a heavy task rather than actual stopping my work.  Sometimes an actual break isn't necessary...just a break from a certain task.  We're doing the same sort of thing using different methods and rules.  <br>Thanks, Seraphim.<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 September 2009 at 3:41 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>learning:<br><br>&gt;I don't do AF but,&lt;<br><br>Maybe you should?

Suppose that during the process of working a really large task, the closed list is ... well, closed ;-)  I.e. you dismiss everything on it and move the line.  Now what was the open list becomes closed.  When you hit that big task on the closed list, if you did not rewrite it at the end of the open list it would change the way the rules made the list work.  Actually, you'd never be able to dismiss the closed list after that until that big task was done because it would be "worked on" but not "crossed off".  The rules don't even have a way to deal with that case.  The rules depend on things being crossed off the closed list so it can be dispatched and the open list items be promoted to the closed list where they get more attention.<br><br>I've actually tried it both ways (crossing off and not) and it does seem to work better when I do cross off and rewrite.<br><br>OH, and one more thing, in the rewriting process there is the opportunity to rethink and rewrite the task.  "Build Deck" becomes "Complete Steps" and "Buy Sealer" and maybe something else as well.<br><br>OH OH ;-) and there is a psychological component as well (isn't there always ;-)  There is some positive feedback that I am actually accomplishing things.  It can seem a bit futile if I work all day and the page has not changed.  At least this way I mark progress.  I get the feedback that I'm actually doing something.  Hard to describe but that feedback helps.<br><br>All of that said, I'm apt not to recopy a task if it is only a line or two away.  I certainly won't recopy it if it becomes something like:<br><br>- Do Project<br>&lt;then I take a break&gt;<br>- Do Project<br><br>That seems the degenerative case that becomes absurd.  It is one of those logical black holes that you get when you become TOO much a slave to the algorithm ;-)  (Wearing my Computer Scientist hat here ;-)  In fact, if I start "chasing the end of the open list", I'll arbitrarily "break out" and start at the top of the closed list just to clear my head.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 September 2009 at 10:02 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good Morning, Andreas<br>I gave Autofocus a couple of serious attempts, but it wrecks havoc with my brain injuries/limitations.
