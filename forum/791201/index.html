I am still alone in my company and have to do the job of 3 person. I work on multiple projects With paper Autofocus it's impossible to know what i did, where i go and how i do it. <br><br> I need to know all about a project and nothing is better for me than a digital solution such as Omnifocus.<br><br>I ve got an iphone so now i can have omnifocus every where and work on my project everywhre too. Think, Report, DO and sync everything back at the office and easely make report to my client when i have to.<br><br>I noticed since i use autofocus my intuition was much better. I noticed too that it was because of the double reading and the reformulation. So now i try to work more on a focus project (a goal for me) on time until i am fed up of it. Omnifocus let me easely go on my context list or work on another project to jump on another task. <br><br>Weekly review are very simple. Omnifocus help me to focus on my goals and area easely. One by one. <br><br>So thank you.

I left Omnifocus to come here. For all  the drawbacks that you mentioned, none of them replace the convenience of paper... the effortless task of jotting down an idea quickly. Alternatively, nothing is more infuriating than trying to type a task into an iPhone (I still hate that keybaord). <br><br>I'm still amazed that AF &amp; paper outperforms all of my other systems.

If you do, I just want you to know it was a pleasure reading your posts - you have always had such a wonderful, positive attitude!<br><br>All the best !!<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2009 at 19:06 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks jacqueline ! No for the moment i dont leave the forum. if you mind ;))<br>I like so much reding your post. It is very interesting. <br><br>The main problem is that I am really worried about my decision because working on a computer is not at all my cup of tea. But at the moment and if Mark dont find another way to use AF (AF2???),  there are still some problem i really can't solve. <br><br>Believe me or not i rather prefer stayin on AF but when you have so many projects, as i have, (76 actives / 20 suspended) AF becomes messy and it is so much difficult for me to manage my tasks at the right time.<br><br>My brain just can't do it... Some night i can tell you that i have some  horrible headhache...<br><br>Also as said I really need to now what is the content of my projects where do i go and how i do it I dont only need to do things wich Af does so well. It is more than this. I have to plan my stratégy for each of them, settle priorities, advance on my goals and AREAS of responsabiliies. <br><br>The idea of putting it on Ever note is a good idea but it wont solve my problems about starting projects and tasks &amp; ending them <br><br>At this point AF treat only about tasks. But it does it well. Sadly for me it not enough. I need more ! and i need to see not only the rocks but the grass, the trees, the animals, the montain, the sky, the sun and the stars. It is not so simple...<br><br>But even if its works with OF, AF is indeed a good system but not enough efficient in my way of working... For the moment... Except is MF has another idea to solve my problem wich is the same than others doint more but doing only the best at the right time. <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2009 at 20:43 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jupiter,<br><br>I am intrigued by AF not working well for you.  As you may have seen in my posts, I have multiple administrative responsibilities, teaching, and many research projects, several of which are major grants funded by NIH.  And I find that AF DOES work for me.  But I do understand it might not for everyone -- I did not mean that to sound critical.<br><br>So...are you going back to a GTD-like approach?<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2009 at 21:12 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I found MLO and other outlining project management systems to be too much overhead, I've been using AF for 6 weeks or so now and havent missed one task because I havent been outlining, good luck Jupiter - see you back here soon ;-).<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Derek</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2009 at 21:19 | Derek D</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter<br><br>No time management system will allow you to do the work of 3 people.  You need to think of different approach, eg hire some resource, push back hard on any new tasks arriving - ask why its needed endlessly and if none of that works, leave.<br><br>Having said that I am sypathetic to your view on AF.  I found it difficult to get an overview of where my projects (and their related tasks) were when they were spread out over many pages.  Unfortunately the GTD alternative of having mutiple lists/contexts with next actions ends up being so complex that the system carries a high overhead.  The is problem is increased if you use an electronic solution where you show the data in many ways - I've found that I stopped trusing these electronic systems.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 June 2009 at 11:44 | Man of Kent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter:<br><br>I agree with Man of Kent's comment. It sounds more as if the real problem is the nature of your business, rather than your time management system. Rather than a Weekly Review of projects which, by the sound of it, is merely perpetuating the problem, I would suggest you take some time to do a Strategic Review of the business as a whole.<br><br>As for project overviews, my response would be that a project needs as much documentation as it needs. No more, no less. Producing an overview for a project can be a task on AF just like anything else.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 June 2009 at 12:50 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi all<br>Thanks for your answers it helps me a lot. May be you are right the problem is more about " nature of your business, rather than my time management system" . AF is good for managing tasks. Projects are well managed on Omnifocus. Strategy is a point i missed. As MF said "Rather than a Weekly Review of projects"  i gona "do a Strategic Review of the business as a whole"  and gona think about the content of my projects. <br>There is something wich has worked quiet nice this morning : the appliance of Autofocused Condensed (Part 1 &amp; 2). as i hd many tasks on omnifocus i reported the one i wanted to do today (in black) on AF and added the incoming tasks in another color (blues). Well i hav been very productive this morning. But did i do the right things at the right time ? I don't know... I shall know it tonight when i shall check what i have done or not.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 June 2009 at 13:52 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It seems as if the issue of project management within a time management system keeps coming up.  I have thought about it and tried to address it as well.  I thought Mark mentioned that this may be a part of his new system.<br><br>Obviously you need to find a way to group the tasks related to your projects in one place so you can get the feel of where the project is.  I had a post on Project Focus where you use an AF like approach to managing projects which may be helpful.  <br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/700900">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/700900</a><br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 June 2009 at 15:40 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter, are all of your projects similar in nature (ie. are the steps to completion the same or at least somewhat standard?)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 June 2009 at 17:51 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@ Mark F. <br>"Rather than a Weekly Review of projects which, by the sound of it, is merely perpetuating the problem, I would suggest you take some time to do a Strategic Review of the business as a whole".<br><br>Indeed interesting. But How Mark ? By area ? Mine are Signature, Business, Work (on project), Company (obligation such as taxe...) Personnal, People, GTD<br>What advice would you suggest ? Thanks for the answer if you have time...<br><br>@ Jacqueline All my projects are different. I have to explain a little more. I act as a broker and asset manager specialised in corporate realestate investments. Basicaly i do all my best to acquire, sell, finance corporate buidings for my clients. Each project is different for each buiding is also different. Then i have to solve many problem around this wich may be commercial financial or negociation or refurbishments or watever you can imagin around realestate. <br><br>If you want to know more about me and my company just have a look on my web site <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.aristoneconseil.fr">http://www.aristoneconseil.fr</a> in english ;)) and French and forgive my mistakes for english is not my native language ;))<br><br>Anyway if if want to succeed i ought to find a system wich works for me. <br><br>Standardisation is just impossible except in the GTD way. AF works great on paper but is messy, repporting stuff on project sheet such as evernote may be convenient to have a glovbal view, heuristic doesnt work really but is good for thinking about alternatives Omnifocus is a solution but not the best one for me for it is hard to follow it I and need a lot of reviewing at least one per day also , i have to copy all in af because i noticed than working on a computer all the day long kill my intuition !!!! This is the worth for me ....<br><br><br>I red the post about project focus. It's a method i have followed in the past with a binder too but it is not easy. The main advantage was the pleasure to trash a sheet of paper when i wanted to get rid of it !!!! such an orgasme !!!!<br><br>So now the only thing i know is than i have to collect all my stuff about a project on word, evernote, omnifocus, a folder or watever keep only but the essential then extract tasks and use AF or another way on paper for it is efficient may be by area ? because it is much better than what is on a computer and the basement are good. The question is only HOW ? May be Mark will anwer it with it new system...

I was so excited about this that at 5 am this morning i woke up and may be found a solution.<br><br>In the rush made 3 list :<br><br>1. Strategic core business where i reported the global goals and opportunities about my core business. For example close my deal on building X, Fond raising of client Y...<br>2. Strategic personnal review i included all personnal aims such as my summer hollidays at Usa (if they are not all sick !!!)<br>3. strategic principle What is the most profitable for me that's my core strategical aims what i want and where i want to go...<br><br>The funny part is that it took me almost... 15 mn.... it seems that my intuition and my brain where starving about it so it was fast and easy. <br><br>I numbered each goal/Mit/Big rock and noticed that was left ONLY 28 instead of 76 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. What is much better isn't it ? <br><br>And now i have (at last !) a global vision of the most important things i have to do and follow. <br><br>Then i kept thes list on my desk and reported all my tasks of the day or soon in the way of "Autofocused Condensed (Part 1 &amp; 2)" as i did yesterday, having a look on he "strategic review" <br><br>For the following of my most important project i put it on evernote because paper sheet is complicated. I am often outside and if i can carry one or two notes books (1 for AF) - I know yours never leave your office- and the other for my notes i can't carry a big binder with all my projects and having them online is easier for me. <br><br>At the end for all dated tasks i am testing a few solution based on tickler, ical, and may be mail tasks (i am on Mac)<br><br><br>When i'll have a little time i gona think and find a solution about what you said "one thing that is always worth looking at is where the money is coming from. What is it that you are doing that brings in the most money? What clients or type of client are most profitable for you? What type of property is most profitable for you?"  Etc.
