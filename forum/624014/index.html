What I have found is that AF is about more than just the tool itself ,i.e. the lists that are produced, but is also about freeing the mind to work the way it is designed to do, uncluttered by all the doubts, fears, worries and just plain stuff that we normally fill it with each day. I had those same concerns but tried to "trust the system" as Mark says and found that I was not missing those things because the system still prompted me, regardless of whether I was actually looking at the relevant list or not.<br><br>To use a couple of specific examples (as I personally find specifics easier to follow so hope others will too) and using home type items as I suspect everyone can identify with them even if they can delegate them   :-)<br><br>My car died on Saturday so I had "requisitioned" my Dad's car.  On Tuesday Dad needed to go shopping.  I did not.  I wanted to work on my lists!  Did I say "sorry Dad, I know you have a carer in to sit with mum so you can go shopping and that I have your car but "go shopping" is on Page 5 of my new Autofocus list and I am only on Page 2"?  Of course not!  I took Dad shopping, remembered to "print shopping list" (also on Page 5) and found myself writing tasks down to add to my list whilst having coffee afterwards.  I did not skip to Page 5, or even go hunting for the items, but just continued from where I had left off when I returned and, when I eventually reached Page 5, just crossed off the items as completed.<br><br>As a second example, after the Christmas period I had a lot of cleaning, tidying and general tasks - a task of "clear up" would just have generated the mental response of "no thanks" so my list contained numerous small items, "clean oven", "take down decorations", "wash kitchen floor" etc etc  Whilst making a cup of coffee I was prompted very easily to do some (not necessarily all) of those tasks, none of which would take very long.  Was I to think "no, I can't do that - they're on Page 8 and I'm in the middle of Page 4" or just do them while the kettle boiled?  I just did them.  To me, at that time and in that context they were a prompting by AF and not procrastination.  I am learning that AF is enabling me to tell the difference.  I did not then go and tick the items off (as I felt that would be a distraction); I went back to Page 4 and carried on from there, but know I will find when I get back to Page 8 that there will items that will be able to be cleared straight away.<br><br>To me those were (for me at the time) the Common Sense aspect that Mark refers to.  The Common Sense trigger will no doubt come at different places and in different scenarios for each of us, but I see it as the event which gives us permission to "break the rules" and that we will instinctively know how.  Learning to "trust the system" I believe enables us to instinctively know what we need to do and when, and what is right for us at any given time.<br><br>Hope that helps someone .......</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 12:12 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As an add-on to my previous post I am starting to become amazed at the number of items that are now naturally following on from actions.  It is becoming almost the norm for one task to lead on to the next without stopping the flow.  For example, where I was initially splitting a task, such as "complete project x" into 4 or 5 initial tasks (which may have been several lines apart on my list as my mind continued to process the project despite doing something else) I have found that by starting the first part of the project I am naturally continuing to later stages, effectively completing several tasks in one go.<br><br>Is anyone else finding this? Thanks again Mark for an amazing system!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 18:55 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br>I do recognize your approach: I came home from work earlier than husband and sontoday, so I started cooking, but in the mean while, I cleaned the woodstove and got some wood outside (we a cold winter in Belgium this year), I started the laundry machine, and did some other small tasks, without first looking on my list 'if I was on the right page'.<br>('You've done a lot already', was my husbands comment....)<br><br>But: there are a few exceptions: I do have some of those 'I am procrastinating now' 'tasks' , like clearing my desk at work, checking mail, bringing my empty coffeecup to the kitchen...<br>These are the tasks I only allow myself to do 'when I'm on the right page', because they are partly only 'made-up tasks'...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 20:42 | AnneTanne</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I know what you mean but I don't think they are necessarily made up tasks.  I think that because we may have used certain things as "procrastinators" in the past that we can actually underestimate the value of those items.  Many years ago I read an article which said that the sub-conscious mind can only process 10 things at once and that if we have more than 10 items in our line of vision when working it can significantly impact our efficiency.  Sometimes when I am procrastinating I notice my desk is cluttered and find that by clearing it my productivity improves and my motivation returns.<br><br>I have examined some of my favourite procrastinators and realised under AF that it is ok to do them - when prompted :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 21:02 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine:<br><br>One thing i've discovered with these "procrastinators" is that under AF I actually have *more* of them than I used to. But I've also discovered that they take much less time than they used to, so they are not really procrastinators at all!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 21:35 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's a great way of looking at them!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 21:48 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, this system allows me to have this kind of 'procrastinators', but they don't really make me procrastinate anymore.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 21:49 | AnneTanne</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes Christine isn't AF amazing in the changes that JUST seem to happen and the flow on effect.<br><br>I think by writing the list and then reading it and re reading it our subconscious "organises" us to do the work that needs to be done.<br><br>I'm finding that as I'm doing something I think "Oh I'll just do this as well"<br>Before I use to think I was procrastinating to get out of doing the next job.<br><br>Now when i go back to the list I find the second job was also on the list.. who knew??..and it was also one I had been avoiding for a week previously. haha<br><br>The flow of work just seems to happen</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 3:22 | Margherita</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
