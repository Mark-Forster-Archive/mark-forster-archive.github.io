I'm hoping to stimulate some discussion around that.<br><br>For instance, I have many more open items on my home list than on my work list - this seems to be the norm, but doesn't make logical sense since the average person spends more time at work than at home, or at least about equal. <br><br>A lot of us have problems getting the book out at home - is this just because we're tired and don't want to do more work?<br><br>I think a lot of us don't write down little things that we do at home but we will at work?<br><br>I'm curious to know what the breakdown of home vs. work tasks are for people who have only one book - do they have more home tasks, thus are spending more time doing home stuff than they are working?<br><br>If someone with only one book that works at home comes to a page or pages where they have left only a bunch of home tasks, do they do a bunch of personal work even though it's their "work hours"?

When I do that, AF just flows - I get a lot done but regardless of the number of items cleared I "feel" productive.  Where i struggle is on the occasiosn where my rational mind is squashing my intuition, when I switch from doing what genuinely stands out to what my rational mind has told me should stand out.  I may get stuff done, I may achieve my "rational" objectives, but somehow I don't "feel" comfortable.  When I go back to "pure AF" there really is a tangible feeling of relief.<br><br>Is there the possibility that you are somehow controlling the tasks that you are doing at home whereas you are more in an accepting mode at work?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2009 at 15:22 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>oops - didn't check that post - should be Hi Jacqueline :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2009 at 15:23 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good topic.<br><br>For me, I can't get through my Home tasks, because I just don't have enough discretionary time.  Plus we always have LOTS to do (six children will do that to you).  Plus, I always need to balance my own list with what my wife thinks are the priorities for the day, and whatever needs the children have come up with during the day.  If I don't do those tasks immediately, then they go on my list, but what if I'm on page 3 and I just wrote those tasks on page 7?  Doesn't work.  It can take me a couple days to work through those pages.  So sometimes I compile all the urgent stuff from other family members, plus whatever is most pressing on my mind, put it all on the last page, and start working the last page.  That works, to deal with whatever is most pressing, but the list overall tends to keep growing, and I am always feeling overwhelmed.<br><br>At work I basically have 8+ hrs of focused discretionary time every day, minus meetings.  Even if I have a few days that are heavy with meetings, I still have far more discretionary time at work in any given week, than I do at home.  Plus, the work culture has a more systematic way of assigning and communicating tasks -- meetings, 1-on-1s, emails, project plans, project review meetings, quarterly planning sessions -- which is much more efficient than the ad-hoc way we handle that at home.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2009 at 16:36 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@ Christine - I'm confused by this sentence:<br><br>"Is there the possibility that you are somehow controlling the tasks that you are doing at home whereas you are more in an accepting mode at work? "  <br><br>Wouldn't that mean I'd have less in my home book than the work book, not more?  In a sense, I do control the work tasks better since I haven't dumped anything into my work book, but have into my home book.  I dismissed all that dumping in my home book though, so what I have left is what I feel is an 'organic' list.<br><br>At work, I have a very strong "compulsion to/for closure."  I have no such tendency at home.  I don't need to use "little and often" much at work.  Usually if I break a task down, it's just so I have a clear spot to go back to if I'm interrupted by a meeting, etc. or to make sure I don't miss a step - like a little project plan.<br><br>Seraphim, I wonder what the cross-over point is where work and home are potentially perfectly balanced.  My guess is for me, if I wasn't renovating and had no other big backlogs, around a 30 hour work week (including commute time).<br>If we accept that (due to kids, spouse, pets etc.) we have possibly an hour of true discretionary personal time per day on weekdays, and 8 hours total on the weekends - it just seems like such a little amount of time!  <br><br>I used to only sleep 5 hours a night, don't want to go back to that again...<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2009 at 19:00 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline<br><br>By controlling the home tasks I meant controlling what you do as opposed to what you put into the list.  For example, if for some reason I feel that there is a task or batch of tasks that I ought to do today, rather than letting the tasks stand out naturally, I feel a need to list those tasks separately and just get on and do them.  Unfortunately, when you are coming at AF from a position of backlog, then I think that is to some extent inevitable, but I do find when I work that way that it is nowhere near as fulfilling or as fun as "pure AF"  I certainly feel the way you describe when i do that so wondered if that was perhaps true for you as well.<br><br>I know the answer is to trust the system - and that really does work.  However, when there are these urgent situations (real or imagined) it is hard to find a way around them.<br><br>Seraphim, when you add your tasks to the last page and work for there, do you find that you feel somehow less comfortable than when you are working "properly"?<br><br>Hope that is a bit clearer .....?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2009 at 19:19 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>BTW, here was another post I found from awhile ago on the same subject:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/648957">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/648957</a><br><br>I don't know Christine, I am coming more and more to the realization that it has nothing to do with any system (although I'm far more motivated and get far more done with AF at home than any other methods I've tried - and I've tried ALOT and navel gazed more than is good for you), it's that you can't fit a 2 ton rock into a gopher hole.  And there's no magic wand or system that will change that.<br><br>For example, if I was at work and I was super busy and never really getting all my work done, I would probably just stay later.  I'd also look into figuring out what I could stop doing, how to move to doing things quarterly instead of monthly, or annually instead of quarterly, or find a way to do things more efficiently.  Pawning things off on another group, lots of options...  But you still have that option of putting in some overtime at the expense of your home life.  <br><br>However, most people can't say "I'm really behind in my laundry, so I can't come to work today."   There are still lots of options to reduce the amount of work at home - batch cooking, lowering housekeeping standards (heheh), getting kids to help out etc.<br><br>But you're still looking at a situation where the backlog cannot go away because it is literally too much work for the time available - full stop.  <br><br>To be honest, I feel pretty productive even on those days at home where I do AF "wrong" too, whether that's picking the least resisted item, not because it really stood out, skipping a page or even hopping around (only a little bit :-) and treating the whole list like one big closed list - just because I feel like it - because I'm always - always - coming back to the system - which is an achievement in itself.<br><br>Not only that, but the slight depression that has dogged me for years is gone and I don't feel like having a glass of wine every day when I get home anymore.  I don't think it's a coincidence that this happened at the same time as starting AF.  I believe that the brain does release happy endorphins when you're engaged, working on something and making progress.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2009 at 23:10 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"it's that you can't fit a 2 ton rock into a gopher hole" LOL - that sounds so much better than "can't fit a quart into a pint pot"!  I really must remember that one :-)<br><br>I think you are right - when we just have too much we just have too much!  I also agree with you about the endorphin effect - overwhelm can so easily lead to depression and the ability to get back in control - even with a backlog - has a massive impact on our mental wellbeing.<br><br>Just hang on in there - you are making progress and ok, so it doesn't all get done as quickly as you would like - but making progress at 50mph is much better than 10mph.  If you need to do things by a deadline you will find a way to do it, so just work with AF as best you can whilst reducing that backlog.  Hey, I've had an idea - why don't we swap backlogs - it's always easier to work on someone else's .... :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2009 at 0:18 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine, I'll gladly do your work if you'll do my house cleaning!<br><br>Reminds me of when I used to get a friend to do my collection calls for me when I was self-employed - you want to see resistance - cooooeee...<br>Eventually decided it wasn't worth the stress and sent them to collection - sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2009 at 3:23 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Jacqueline - you wrote "Seraphim, I wonder what the cross-over point is where work and home are potentially perfectly balanced" etc.<br><br>Yes, there just doesn't seem to be enough time to do all the things I've signed up for, and all the things I'd LIKE to do.  I don't know how to make it work.  Unless I find a way to make the "Four Hour Work Week" into a reality.  (See book and blog by Tim Ferris)<br><br>Does this mean totally re-evaluating what I hope to accomplish in my personal life?  Does it mean totally re-evaluating the paradigm of spending 40-50 hrs/wk at a "job" and throwing the remaining crumbs of time to my family?<br><br>What I really find fascinating about this, is that no other time-management system ever prompted me to ask questions like this.  I was always asking questions like "Why can't I make this work" and "Why do I still feel so out of control".  But with Autofocus, while I still feel like I've got too much to do, I am able to start identifying the whys and wherefores thereof -- and meanwhile make an awful lot of progress getting at least SOME of it done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2009 at 3:56 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@ Christine - You wrote, "Seraphim, when you add your tasks to the last page and work for there, do you find that you feel somehow less comfortable than when you are working "properly"?"<br><br>No, it works fine for me.  It's very natural, and maintains the same Autofocus "feel".  But then again, I only take this approach when I'm feeling overwhelmed by the urgency of certain items, and want to see them all in one place.<br><br>I suppose I could make it totally Autofocus-compliant by sprinkling in a few tasks on every page that say "Switch to last page to process urgent items?".  But the "common sense" rule is probably good enough.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2009 at 3:59 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The obvious answer if there is insufficient time to do the Home tasks, is to work less hours.

Firstly, if operated per instructions, it will eventually lead to lots of dismissed pages and tasks. Subsequently, it would lead to reflection on the cause of that situation and how to rectify it. <br><br>Limited choices: <br>1. Put less on the Home list; <br>2. Do less work and more Home; <br>3. Employ or persuade someone else to do stuff on the lists.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2009 at 8:30 | Dm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline<br><br>You're on!

The way I have done it is to add all of the relevant tasks, so that when I reach an urgency situation I have maybe added 20, 30 or 40 related tasks in one hit.  Doesn't do a lot for my statistics :-)  The problem is that, although those tasks then get actioned and crossed off, the few remaining tasks on the page have now lost the ability to be reviewed so often.  They will need to be actioned or dismissed a lot sooner without my subconscious having the opportunity to chew over them for so long.  Hmmmm - more thinking on this method required for me .......<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2009 at 13:28 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine - I really like the "add urgent items to last page, and start working that page" approach, because it doesn't change how you process anything.  You just start working that page.<br><br>And once you're done with the most urgent items, and start moving on, you just start cycling through the book as normal.  <br><br>I guess if I was jumping to the last page whenever I had a bit too much caffeine, it would really mess up the system, but doing it on rare occasions works great for me.  <br><br>Another thing I really like about this approach is that it keeps everything in one place -- no special "urgent today" list, no abandoning the system till the crisis passes, and all that.  It's just normal Autofocus.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2009 at 20:05 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim - I think my problem has been that the last couple of weeks have included a couple of family issues that have impacted heavily on my time, with the result that a lot of things AF may well have handled became urgent - or perhaps it was just that my state of mind was making them so!  I think that if I had added them as single items, eg "prepare for meeting" rather than the 20 or so constituent parts, such as locate minutes from last year's AGM, read minutes, make notes, print minutes etc., it would have been more sensible.  At least when I get to those new last pages I will have lots of items to cross off! <br><br>As from Monday it's back to normal Autofocus for me - although I will have some urgent must do items to do something with ...... :-)<br><br>And as for the "too much caffeine" LOL - I don't think I'll have that problem - I have to put "coffee" on my list to remind myself to take a break!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 March 2009 at 0:48 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Dm , Seraphim and Laurence, you are all exactly right - the regular 40'ish hour work week really doesn't allow for a whole lot else to get done besides work, family and some minimal leisure - and maybe one or two non-time intensive hobbies. <br><br>I've read Tim Ferriss' stuff and I like his philosophy.  I don't know that it can ever necessarily be as low as 4 hours - I would wager he himself works significantly more than that (maybe 20 hours?) :-).  Although much of what he's doing as work is enjoyable, it's still being done to earn money and takes away time from other things.<br><br>That's the primary reason why I've been working so hard these last number of years to be able to semi-retire - work 4-6 months of the year or not if I choose and travel / snowbird the rest of the time.
