I also have a number of these who seem upset with me when I am not up-to-date with them and commenting on them. "Didn't you read my blog?" That kind of thing. I do have my blogs in a reader.

Treat them as a hobby and, as any hobby, you get to them in your spare time. If you’re posting on Facebook even once an hour, or trying to gain contacts on Linkedin every day, or following two dozen people on Twitter, it’s the equivalent of spending six hours a day collecting stamps, or spending all day tuning the car’s engine, or not coming out of the garden for the entire weekend.<br>You know who engages in that kind of behavior? Retired people, people with WAY too much time on their hands, that’s who."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2010 at 6:09 | kneitinga</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Spontaneously, I'd say the correct answer to "Didn't you read my blog?" would be "No, sorry, I was busy having a life.", but that's probably a bit too harsh. And I stopped commenting on friends' blogs a long time ago, unless it's something I'm really interested in. I still read the articles, but I don't spend much time on it. When I action my "Google Reader" task from DWM, I'm normally done in under two minutes (though I do that several times a day, but it doesn't amount to more than 15 minutes total). I don't even log into Facebook daily anymore, more like weekly, and life still goes on. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2010 at 6:18 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Come to think of it, my biggest time sink at the moment is this forum. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2010 at 6:20 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'd probably suggest they get a life.

We all have to spend far too much time on electronic things for work, the we sit and watch TV - it never ends!  I've just had a great weekend catching up with friends, walking the dogs in fields with lots of wildlife and I feel a different person for it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2010 at 9:22 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas Hofmann wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; Come to think of it, my biggest time sink at the moment is this forum. &gt;&gt;<br><br>And I thank you for that and AFAHK. ;-)<br><br>Mel wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; I do have my blogs in a reader.

But, I use my Window Mobile at all the odd times in between tasks/meetings/waiting/queuing/transit to read pocketwit, m.facebook.com and google reader iphone mode. If I restrict twitter/facebook/greader to those times, it wouldn't impact my time for other tasks at all.

If they want ME to know something personally - pick up the phone or shoot me an email, don't expect me to read your blog to find out about your life.  I go on googlereader about once a month or so.  It just doesn't occur to me I guess.<br><br>I suppose different people have different purposes for their blogs.  I write mine for myself, to think things through, have a record of some things, not for other people at all.   Some people - like your friends - use it as a means of keeping others posted on what's going on in their lives.  But just like you might not talk to those people on the phone every day or email them every day, you can't be expected to read their blogs every day either.<br><br>I go on facebook maybe once every couple of months and my friends have learned (I wish!) that I ignore all the little games and stuff that they send me.  I use FB pretty much only for a receptacle for mobile photo uploads.  Hmm.  Perhaps this is why I only have a few close friends and not 500 acquaintances.  Acquaintances are overrated, friends are not.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2010 at 16:55 | Jacqueline</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
