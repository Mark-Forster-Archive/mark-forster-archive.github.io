She-Who-Thinks-She-Must-Be-Obeyed has joined me here in Damascus for the next 12 months and brought out from the UK some items I wanted with me here.<br><br>In addition to the Moleskine Large notebook (ruled lines), I also asked Gill to bring out a Moleskine Small soft cover (about A6) as a pocket notebook for odds and sods, errands etc.<br><br>I have always considered A6 as a bit too small for my AF/DWM use, but in reviewing all the entries to be transferred I realised that I could fit nearly all my tasks onto the smaller page size, even if a few have to span more than one line.  So my new DWM notebook is the Moleskine Small.<br><br>(1) Do any A6/small notebook AF/DWM users out there consider the size a disadvantage and may, if not already, return to A5 or A4/letter?  I'll make my own judgement, I'm just interested how other users have found different sizes make for a better or worse AF/DWM experience. <br>I consider A6 too small for meeting notes and other work, A5 is my preference for that sort of stuff.  However, for DWM where I use just the RH pages for tasks, A6 is ok and a better use of paper.  I use LH pages as well as empty space on expired RH pages for things like errands, tel numbers, email addresses, recording expenses etc.<br><br>(2) Up to now, I have been dating every RH page in the 28 day cycle I use.  Thus all pages after the current day 28 (eg today's "last" page, or "M" as some call it, is Monday 31 May) are blank. <br>One of the disadvantages for me is that my addled mind tends to view the tasks in relation to the date and I have to "force" myself to disregard the date on the page unless the task I am looking at has a deadline date.  So the best thing for me as I see it is to adopt the practice that others have mentioned and just have a moveable page marker tag for D (toDay), W (Week = +7 for re-entered tasks only) and M (Month = +28 for new tasks only).  In typing this, I realise I can dispense with tag D and just write in the actual date when that page is Today, because the W and M tags will show me where the task entry pages are.  Thus the last dated page will be Today, or yesterday when I start the new day.<br>Again, I can use the Moleskine ribbon and elastic band as markers, but will probably use a small Post-it page as well.<br><br>Any comments?<br><br>I think taking the dates out of the 28 forward pages will give me a better perception of the several closed lists, provided I do write the deadline date against any task that MUST have a ABF date (Absolutely B****y Final).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 May 2010 at 8:50 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>After a thread about street walker (peripateticienne) now this :)<br><br>About size:<br>Just this an A4 notebook (opened up is A3) is much desktop real estate.  That's why I prefer smaller formats.  I even made one year my own weekly pocketable (Moleskine cahier size but thinner) notebooks with a sewing machine for DIT.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 May 2010 at 9:07 | Damien</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use a Paperchase Soft Flexible Journal with 200 squared pages (about A6 size I think).  I use the  right-hand side for DWM.  Each page has 35 rows, and I draw a vertical line so that I can enter 70 tasks per page (although someone with long task names, or large handwriting, might prefer to stick to the 35 rows).<br><br> In front of each task I leave a square, and when I have processed a task I cross it out, then colour in the square, so it's very easy to see what tasks still remain to be done.  <br><br>I've experimented with using the left-hand page as well, so that the notebook would last twice as long, but it's too clumsy, and besides, the left-hand side is useful for keeping notes, etc. <br><br>Because it's only A6, and soft-covered, it's perfect for carrying around outside, as well as using at home.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 May 2010 at 10:40 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I quite like A5 spiral bound pads, and usually write notes 'double density' with two written lines for every ruled line. <br><br>I've always had a bit of a thing against Moleskines for some reason, :~) why do people like them in particular?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 May 2010 at 22:08 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>smileypete, I like them for the paper quality (little to no bleed-through, nice smooth surface) and for their durability.  Last time I had a moleskine for my notes/journal notebook it stood up to daily use/bashing/toddler-drawing and was as good as new structurally when I filled the last page 18 months after I started it.  No other notebook I've ever had stands up to that kind of abuse as well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2010 at 3:17 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>sp: I used to think the same until a mate bought one and I had a closer look.  For me, it's not a trendy thing, it's another example, as Sarah has highlighted, of the fact that quality does mean paying a little more.  <br><br>My A5 DWM notebook is/was spiral bound as well.  Moleskine with spiral rings would be nice, but the aficionados would probably revolt and take to the streets :-))<br><br>Maybe it is a bit of indulgence, but like luggage (and other things), you get what you pay for.  This is why I buy Redoxx bags except for check-in cases which are Samsonite hardshell, polypropylene (I think), get scratched, but very durable and more secure (although the US border/TSA people have no problem in opening them without breaking them, so far).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2010 at 5:06 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Quick post during a quick break.<br><br>Thinking further: while I have stated somewhere that I like the concept of DWM being broken up into days (0 - 28 for me) so that it is a series of short lists, I am finding some space and momentum are being wasted.<br><br>I have some days with very little on them, probably because I didn't get to them when they were each Day 28 previously.  As they are closed, they will not have anything added to them until they each get to Day 7,  The same is true of all pages/dates 8 to 27.<br><br>I am now thinking of ruling a line under Day 28 at the end of the day and starting tomorrow, the new Day 28, under that line.  My DWM RH pages will then become a long list separated by a line at each date change.  I still have the LH pages available, see below for additional items done Today without having been previously entered on a Day 28.<br><br>I'm also considering adding additional/urgent  or "Below The Line" Tasks done Today (Day 0), ie NOT entered as New in Day 28, on the LH page on Day 0, opposite the closed list for that day on the RH page.<br><br>Regardless of any comment of feedback, I think I will try this tweak, maverick that I tend to be, though not in the Palin (Sarah) sense, Mike :-))))</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2010 at 9:27 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>... and RogerJ wins the prize for the most ambiguous forum thread title, I wasn't sure what I'd find here and clicked with some trepidation ;-)<br><br>Anyway I have been converted to Moleskine after I found a pack of notebooks in a sale. They are very hard-wearing and yes, reasonably child-proof too.<br><br>Going slightly off-topic, I also thought that Samsonite suitcases were durable, until RyanAir handed one back with huge gouges in it. I still don't know how they managed it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2010 at 9:53 | clara</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>just to add that my favourite Moleskine is the week-at-a-glance diary on one side of the page and a lined page on the other to add any extra comments.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2010 at 9:58 | clara</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>. . . and Clara wins the prize for being the first person brave enough to comment on the thread title! ;-)))))<br><br>A gouge is ok provided there wasn't a hole made, or was it that bad?  I'm not really surprised, I've seen some terrible airports and handlers, the latter sometimes acting with intent.<br><br>Re your Moleskine diary: small, large or extra large?  I was wondering if there are enough lines on the RH for tasks for a week (line down the middle  of RH page could work if size permits) or do you insert the tasks into the dates on the LH pages?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2010 at 13:09 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If your thread title were an email I received, it would have earned a one-way ticket to the Spam folder ;-)<br><br>The suitcase had a few punctures that penetrated the hard outer shell and also some deep scratches carved into it.

I use the RH page for anything to do with the calendar entries, but it isn't my AF notebook. <br><br>For example if I have - "picnic?" - on Sunday, opposite that I've written  "give Y. a lift"  <br>Opposite  "school trip",  I've got the cost of the trip and what I need to pack.<br>I also use it for notes to remind me what to mention in phone calls I have to make.<br><br>It couldn't replace my AF book, as sometimes anything and everything ends up written down in it.

Better because I don't have transition periods with two books and because I'm flexible in shuffling pages (e.g. I like to have my project overviews at the end of the book).

I have been very underwhelmed by moleskin notebooks - I like the idea of them, and they are very well constructed, however the paper quality leaves a lot to be desired with my fountain pens - I get a lot of feathering and bleed through.<br><br>Paperchase notebooks (especially the grid ones) are a superb quality and great with fountain pens.<br><br>Size IS an issue for me. I've been moving from the office standard A4 down to A5,but am now wondering if I can go smaller for portability.  I like to use what I call a 'daybook' in which I make all notes of conversations, phone calls, planning notes etc and this for me has always been A4.  Only because it lasts longer. I work for myself (am freelance) so can really use whatever I want.<br><br>I think it is imporant to use a notebook you really love so you want to use it, but it has to be a size that fits with your lifestyle and possibly your handwriting size!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 May 2010 at 19:13 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;however the paper quality leaves a lot to be desired with my fountain pens - I get a lot of feathering and bleed through.&gt;<br><br>Ink can also play a part in this, what ink are you using?<br><br>&lt;Paperchase notebooks (especially the grid ones) are a superb quality and great with fountain pens.&gt;<br><br>I'll have to give them a try sometime.The A5 notebooks I use are Silvine SPA5 - a google will turn up some info.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 May 2010 at 23:55 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I tend to use Mont Blanc ink which is very well behaved (my personal favourite is the old 'Violet' now renamed as Lavender Purple' I believe). <br><br>If you get a Paperchase notebook, look for a grid one with 'Miquelrius' wri'tten in the inner margin - it is a spanish paper they use which is particularly nice. I can't really speak for any other paper they use.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2010 at 16:59 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison, perhaps you had an iffy Moleskine. Maybe the pen/ink combination makes a difference, wonder what Sarah uses on hers?<br><br>As an aside, one thing I've started doing recently is writing more with my shoulder so my hand doesn't rest so heavily on the page, makes it easier to write up to the spiral binding and down to the bottom of the page.<br><br>Takes a bit of getting used to, I found that gradually taking the weight of my arm off the page and steadying my arm on the edge of the desk or my side helps.
