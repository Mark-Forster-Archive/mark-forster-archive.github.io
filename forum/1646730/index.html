I'm still loving it. I think I'm going to be loving it even more now that I just filled up the book I had been using and started a new one. This let me be a bit more deliberate in the setup of the book and deal with some of the challenges I had with converting what had been just a personal journal to an "everything book".<br><br>The first six pages (three sheets) of the new book are reserved for the table of contents (in the last book I just wrote them on inside of the cover, which I didn't love). I'm still using post-its as an index for things I'm likely to have to find again by context (dissertation stuff, teaching, AF pages). Page 1 contains all of the dismissed items from the old book; pages 2 &amp; 3 have other things from the old book that I want to continue to have easy access to. Page 4 contains all of the un-done items from all but the open page of my SF list in the old book. I skipped lines to indicate where the page breaks are. The "real" SF list begins on page 5. I've been indicting columns on my 35-line pages just by folding the page in half when I start it to create a line that isn't too obtrusive.<br><br>As usual, I have a variety of paperclips to denote different things. One on the first SF page, and one on the current "notes" page. A sparkly pink one on the open SF page; a purple one on the side of the page pointing at the current task on SF pages. I've added a post-it flag for the first page of real content (as opposed to the table of contents). Sub-lists for the things I have to do to get ready for class and for post-class processing are on post-its on the inside cover.<br><br>If there's interest I could scan selected pages for folks to see.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 November 2011 at 20:31 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sarah,<br><br>I used to use this method and liked its simplicity.  Are you using a bound book or looseleaf?  I would like to see a few pages.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 November 2011 at 21:01 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry, it's a bound book... roughly 5"x7" (what I think of as "standard" moleskine size, though it's not a moleskine or even attempting to pretend to be a moleskine). I'll add "scan book pages" to my list. :^)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 November 2011 at 1:34 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For me, the free form notebook idea is one of the few ideas in time management that I've been sticking to for more than a few months, which speaks volumes of it's benefit for me.  Other long-standing ideas include, of course, autofocus (AF1 in particular, which I've been using almost since it's inception a few years ago, and which I use with my free form notebook) and I also still manage my projects as recommended by GTD. In fact, I like GTD because of it's attempt at completeness, but I found, as so many others, that the way of managing the daily workflow was not nearly as effective as AF.  <br><br>In terms of completeness, the free form notebook has it.  But I had to be disciplined with it.  After the first few weeks of using it, I found it got too cluttered and I started worrying about missing stuff because it was hard to find.  So I added just a bit of structure to it.  Except for the briefest daily record of events page, I don't use it for journalling or more extensive writing or brainstorming.  For that I'll just use whatever medium works and then file it in my filing system - electronic or paper.  That declutters my free form notebook significantly.  But if I do journal and it's important, I could note it on my Daily Record page with a reference to where to find it.  As David Allen calls it, it's a stake in the ground. Otherwise I use my notebook (5 by 7 moleskin) for my monthly calendars, AF lists, and individual projects (one project per page). I have kept the monthly calendars grouped together for about 6 months, I use the left side of the page for one line per day and the right side of the day for any notes that occur that impact that particular month's events.   Now stuff is easy to find and my weekly review is effortless.  I have other types of lists as I need them, and an index. I also use about 6 post it tags to mark my af pages, the current month and my project list. I use the moleskin ribbon to mark my current AF page. I'd like to thank the authors of a post a few weeks ago about using a similar notebook with a kind of project focus.  I don't go quite that far, but the ideas were inspiring.  <br><br>So to summarize, I would just say that for me, free form notebook is a very effective capture tool, but not a journalling tool, and I find making that distinction has turned a great idea into a stable method for managing my life.   <br><br>Hope that helps!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 November 2011 at 13:47 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Sarah, I'd like to see some of your layout, pages, etc.  Thanks.  I'm conducting a little experiment.  I've been using the project focus book (see thread "Project focus all in one book system") for around six months with great success.  It's actually very similar to the free-form AF1 setup you're using.  There seem to be common elements in all the successful systems including writing in one place and keeping notes with actions.<br><br>The project focus works because it drives actions on a small number of projects at once until completion.  Day to day stuff is recorded and actioned in a similar way to AF1 (basically just a list of things to do).  However there have been occasions when a different project has needed priority at which point the project focus loses some focus.  I can either re-write the PF page withn the new project or else go off-system for that project and get it done, which is what I've been doing, but it doesn't quite sit right with me to do that.<br><br>So I'm going to experiment with the free-form layout as I have now, with projects planned with completion criteria on a page as I have now, but using an AF1 workflow for the actual actions and capturing new things.  Thus I need a way to highlight 3 or 4 projects at any one time as being current so I can keep them in the AF1 list.<br><br>I could put a paperclip or page marker on each project page and move them as needed.  I could make a note at the front that project focus is w, x, y and z and just cross them out and ammend as I go.  If you have items in your AF list which need reference to a page of notes and which are re-written as they develop, how do you tend to tie the action and the notes together?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 November 2011 at 13:59 | Chris L</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another vote for the free-form notebook. I find this idea extremely liberating: anybody can be organised, all that's needed is a simple notebook. No clumsy binders or expensive pre-printed "systems".<br><br>I had a notebook with discs (like Rollabind) which allowed pages to be moved, but I have abandoned it for an A4 spiral. I date and number each page. I make a contents list, but I find that I can remember the location of most things, as I can remember roughly when they were entered. The spiral notebook is open on my desk all day and everything goes into it - except timed appointments, which go in a diary.<br><br>By chance, the first notebook I bought for this purpose had perforated pages for easy removal and punched holes. I continue to use this type of notebook, as it allows pages full of specialised information, such as minutes of meetings, or detailed notes on a specific subject, to be removed and filed elsewhere.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2011 at 21:10 | tarentola</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html</a><br><br>Thanks to Gerry for citing this article on his blog. I've been using this approach for only a few days. I use a hard back A4 book. The only change is that I use the GSD (Get Sh*t Done) coding method for tasks - which are boxes with dots, ticks, slashes and crosses through them. I only mark three tasks at a time to do from the list. <br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://utilware.com/gsd3.html">http://utilware.com/gsd3.html</a><br><br>It's early days, but so far it feels like a breath of fresh air.

I have always kept all of my journals anyway, but having the academic stuff electronically is a good idea too.<br><br>For time-sensitive repeating tasks, I use iCal events as reminders, and then either do the task right away or add it to the list as an urgent (C2) item. For stuff that's repeating but not extremely time-sensitive (emptying the kitty litter, vacuuming various bits of the house, etc.) I just re-enter it at the end of the list after I do it and indicate in parentheses when I last did it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 November 2011 at 15:45 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I started a thread about free form notebooks a while ago, and I am glad that people are using it.  I am still using mine, but didn't have anything new to report.   <br>I use a medium sized ruled Moleskine.  I wish the Moleskine was not so expensive, but it is the right size.  It is so much lighter than a laptop or notebook, which is consideration when you get older.  I carry it around everywhere, and put in my briefbag.  It is great for making quite telephone notes, notes in quck conversations, etc.  It beats any computer in ease of collection.

If a task does go on a research or planning page, I add a circle to the margin, and check through the circle when the task is done. That way, I see them easily when I reach that page in AF, or if I'm quickly looking through the book to see what absolutely has to be done in the next few days if I don't think I'll cycle through the book often enough.<br><br>I clip page corners when I've done everything on the page. That includes copying notes to a more permanent location if necessary.<br><br>I don't keep the notebooks. When it's full (6-18 months, depending on size of book and how many times we visit the doctor that year) I tear it apart and file the pages by topic. Sometimes I pull out pages for a topic earlier if I want to see it all in one file. Yes, spiral notebooks work best for that. They also fold over nicely to take up less room on my desk.

But at $18-20, it is expensive.  So I looked for alternatives.   I am now using a spiral notebook,  $ 0.99, college ruled 70 sheets, and plan to replace each month or so with another one.  To protect it from wear and tear and make it more businesslike,  I looked and looked for a binder to put in.   I bought an $18 dollar At-A-Glance Planner binder 9 X 11, and put the spiral notebook in it.  It has a pocket where I am keeping my last Moleskine.  So far it is working out.  The pages are perforated so I can tear them out or remove them.  I prefer the spiral notebook to a three ring binder.  <br>With spiral notebooks so cheap, I wonder why there are so few products to put them in.  There are many padfolios with legal pads, and three ring binders.  <br>I prefer the smaller size Moleskine 5 X 8, but could not find an alternative.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 December 2011 at 17:48 | markhedm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am trying out an idea tonight using an Excel form.  I like some Free-Form topics in a 3-ring notebook, and I like some in individual folders.  <br>These topics can include the start of new projects or used to completely manage smaller ones.<br><br>On the form, for each topic, there are narrow columns for where it is (FF notebook or folder).   I keep these free-form folders separate from other files.<br><br>The whole idea is that I want a quick-reference, one-page index of my main free-form topics pre-printed on the form.  Then there are plenty of blanks for stuff I didn't include typed-out on the form.<br><br>The maintenance aspect of this sort of system will require processing (transferring tasks to AF, projects or discarding), scanning and filing away papers.  But even if I let it the tabs or folders get too big, they will become back-logs in which I hope I will be able to deal with in a timely and organised manner (using bookmarks) to avoid clutter build-up.<br><br>I did this because I frequently lose track of where important day-to-day stuff went or how it was captured.  It is also a place to put real important stuff; like scheduled tasks, project stuff that is purely digital, scheduled events (hard deadlines and meetings and calendar pages), routines and checklists, side lists, a place to tape all those receipts and scraps of paper, bill paying, banking, mind maps, print-outs, phone notes and even journaling.  <br><br>I hope it works and does not interfere with my simple-as-possible AF system with its capture and AF task back-logs.  It is a combination of the Free-Form idea and an expansion of Gerry's "One-Place."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 December 2011 at 21:07 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>BKK,<br><br>When I refer to one place, for me it means using only one "capture" device.  My free form notebook is my one place.  So anything I hand write like a list, mind map, idea or phone notes only goes into my spiral notebook.  This includes the index.  The system you are discussing seems like it has more than one place.  You have two filing systems, a notebook and now an excel index.  <br><br>Everything else in my system is in a simple a- z filing system.  This would include contracts, emails related to a project, memos from others, schedules etc.  Additionally what I used to do at the end of a notebook was to review it to see if anything I had handwritten is worth keeping and it then file it.  I am going to experiment with just keeping the the notebooks now that I write an index at the front.<br><br>I came into the office this morning and reviewed the notebook and I was struck by how many things I needed to work on which I would not have remembered if they were in several places.  It is a very refreshing experience to know that as long as you are writing in one place you can quickly review your notebook and be on top of everything in your business world.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 December 2011 at 22:32 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>hi all,<br><br>For those of you using the free form book, I have a couple questions:<br><br>1.  Let's say you have a project page, say page 17, and now you're on page 31 for the day.  You have a conversation with someone about project from page 17.  Do you go to your table of contents, find the page it was on (17) and update the project log?  Or do you write the notes from the conversation on page 31 and reference that page on page 17?<br><br>2.  Again, you have a project on page 17.  I'm assuming you do your project planning on that page, including tasks, etc.  Do you then rewrite the tasks on your SF/AF/DWM list and then when they are completed update the project page?  Or do you use the project page and work it like a DWM/SF/AF list?<br><br>I have about 30-40 short term (less than 2 weeks) projects going at any given time.  Any conversation I have, task I delegate, etc I need to either a.  have on my project page or b.  easily find it.  For most of my projects, I have to write a detailed summary page for litigation purposes so can't afford to not have all pertinent info.  <br><br>I have been keeping a loose leaf page for each project, going through those project pages each morning, separating the project pages I need to work on for the day, and then using the actual project pages as my task lists.  I haven't been copying down the tasks to a SF/AF /DWM list but have been working the project pages just like one of these.  I love the idea of the free-form book but I'm trying to find a way to make it work with my needs.<br><br>Thanks for your insight.<br><br>Brett</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 December 2011 at 5:19 | brettypooh</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey Gerry.  Good to hear from you, again.  Yes, I am well aware of your "one (and only one) place." That is why I referred to my trial as being "an expansion of Gerry's 'One-Place.'"<br><br>Before I ever read any of your comments or looked at your links, I used to try and keep everything in one notebook.  If I had stacks of papers and in-box stuff, I would  put them with the group of existing (current) papers in the notebook.  Then, I would keep a rough-&amp;-dirty index in the front with each subject numbered A,B,C, etc.  And then, pencil in those letters on the actual pages (A1, A2, etc. - if I wanted to).  <br><br>I got sloppy, though.  However, your posts, as well as the Free-Form posts, and posts that reaffirm how important it is to: <br><br> - Keep things simple.<br><br> - To only create side lists if your really need to.<br><br> - Realise that if a system becomes too complicated, the disadvantages will outweigh the advantages (or just become unusable).<br><br>...have got me back on track again.<br><br>Anything that is created, has to be "looked at" and "processed" in one form or another.  I learned this once the hard way when I just delivered a bunch of boxes to my accountant with piles of documents, receipts and credit card statements, and told him "to sort it out."  It took him days and cost me a fortune because he +had+ to look at (and do something with) every single thing.<br><br>It is even worse now with hi-tech gadgets where you can email yourself from the iPad, and use apps to web-clip, read it later, scan it later, open up the website later, etc.<br><br>This week, I am using tabs A-Z in the notebook.  If the tabs don't work, I will just drop the idea (but try to remember the "less is more" adage).<br><br>But the second system you referred to is not my index, it is a set of blank, pre-numbered folders sitting in close proximity.  Sometimes, I don't +feel+ like putting something in my notebook, and I don't want it sitting in my in-box, and I want to find it quickly (current stuff).  My +goal+ is to simply have a simple alphabetic filing system (like you do).  I can not just get myself to put those things "out-of'-sight-and-out-of-mind" like that when they still have the "free-form" status.  Maybe with time.<br><br>The pre-printed index in Excel trial I am doing came about because it works like a checklist, as well.   There are many "free-form-type" themes that I should be tracking or doing that I just don't do.  Sure, these items could be put on a separate checklist, but being already in my free-form index, I hope it kind of draws me to actually do them (and save me grief).  <br><br>On the index, if there is a letter next to the item, it's in the notebook;  if there is a number, it's in a folder; if there is nothing, it does not exist.  <br><br>So, I agree, breaking away from your one-and-only-one-place might not work well because it will of course take maintenance once the tabs get full, or the folders too numerous.  And I might have to be less "free" with my Free-Form.<br><br>But, I don't disagree with any of your comments and suggestions; they are all appreciated.  You summarised it well in this thread with "...which I would not have remembered if they were in several places."  Couldn't agree more.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 December 2011 at 10:56 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Brett - My personal opinions only:<br><br>(1)  I go back to page 17.  I can then make a page 17-B if I want to.  That is why I use loose-leaf, 3-hole punch.  If you use a hard-bound notebook, you will have to do something like you describe.<br><br>(2)  Depends.  If the project or the list of tasks pertaining to the project is small or manageable enough, do it ALL in AF. (That's the tool that really works.)  "Updating the project page" (or not) is a personal decision at the time, depending how important or trivial the item is.<br><br>On the other hand, using AF techniques and bookmarks within project pages can work well, too.  In fact, using AF principles in almost anything can work - like backed-up emails, side lists, clutter in the attic, going through a zillion photos, back-logs of papers and files, etc.<br><br>For your last two paragraphs, the index is the key to the free-form.  Digitally (scans, hard drive files, etc.) (in my Mac alternative to MS OneNote), I also keep a monthly as-brief-as-possible index page with live links to other pages within the program (wiki), links to digital documents located elsewhere, and url's.  Here, the searching feature is the key.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 December 2011 at 11:28 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use a notebook with repositionable sheet. It is almost overkill for me because I only have a few projects to follow-up in the same time, but quite handy : <br>I curently have one section for autofocus tasks list, and 4 sections for the 4 projects I follow-up, in which I keep notes and checklists. <br>The convenient side of this is that you can add as many pages you want in any section, and number them as you want, (I mark the project name at the top of each page, then a page number). In autofocus, when I need to refer to a project page, let's say project A page 3, I just write AP3 next to the task.<br>I use small stickies that protude out of the notebook to mark the last page of each project, so that I can jump to the hottest page of this project quickly. <br>It really is several notebooks stacked together, with the advantage of having an adjustable number of page in each notebook. No more unused pages, no more "end of section, but I still need more pages".  But it still is just one notebook to carryaround.<br>I think it could be quite useful for Brettypooh, as when a project is closed, you can remove the corresponding pages, file / archive them, without any perturbation on the rest of the notebook.<br>There are several suppliers for this system, you can search the web for the "Circa", "Atoma", or "Adoc" system. As the patent for this type of notebook is public, you may find other brands as well, under "disc bound notebook"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 December 2011 at 13:38 | AlexB</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm using a pocket Moleskine with lists in the front and notes in the back. Not very sophisticated, but it works for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 December 2011 at 14:03 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Brett,<br><br>I think I first saw you posting about Project Focus which obviously works.  You mentioned that you need to keep notes for possible litigation purposes, so a file may be the way to go.  If I had notes on pages 17 and then on 31, I would use a notebook where the pages remove and when I had completed any tasks on these pages, I would file the notes in the appropriate file.  <br><br>So two ways to do it.  One - Project Focus and cycle through the project files using a tasks list in each project file to make sure you stay on track.  Second project files plus a notebook or legal pad where the task list and notes are both recorded.  Reduce the pages of the notebook/legal pad by filing or tossing them and also keep the task list in "one place" in the book or the legal pad.  Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 December 2011 at 19:12 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>hi Gerry<br> <br>I really appreciate the response.  I think you're pretty much right.<br><br>I think I'm going to go with the following system:<br><br>1.  Project notes, loose-leaf in a Mead a-z file holder.  I plan to cycle through them AF-style. For times when I know I'm not going to have access to my project notes, I will place urgent tasks in my notebook to ensure they get handled that day.<br>2.  Notebook:  I plan to use DWM2 for all of my non-project tasks, as well as new project tasks.  For tasks that I know belong to a project and I can't get to his right away, I will put an empty circle in the margin.  In my weekly review, I will transpose those to my project notes if I haven't done it by then.<br><br>We'll see how that works.<br><br>Thanks again,<br><br>Brett</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 December 2011 at 0:55 | brettypooh</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
