If use 30 days in the future for new tasks and 7 days into the future for re-added tasks. In went for 30 days instead of a month because it's easier to calculate (with a computer, that is). That's okay. The problem is, if a tasks in AutofocusAHK 'stands on the page' February 5th, it will be removed as soon as it's February 5th. In Mark's original instructions, it would live the whole of Feb 5 and only be deleted as soon as Feb 6 starts.<br><br>It's easy to fix, I guess, just delete tasks one day later.

But it doesn't really matter if it's 28 or 30 days. The problem of short and long months and some days getting jammed isn't an issue in any case, since it's always the same number of days, regardless of how the current month. In fact, since the current implementation let's tasks expire immediately on "their" day, it's really 29 days. I'll fix it later. But anyways, the issues you mentioned don't apply to using 30 days fixed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 11:21 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>Exactly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 11:22 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Andreas H.<br>You are absolutely correct!

Several of the neighbors and I formed a chain gang and plowed about 1/8 mile to the street and ran shifts to get food to the senior citizens and moms with very young children.  Passing the flask kept us going!  lol!  I love snow even when it's inconvenient....although I've never been buried under an avalanche!  Geeeeezzzzzz, the thought............shivers to the spine!

So you can save a website's address along with a task (for example, I have the task "Check Mark Forster's forum, and the url is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.net/forum).">http://markforster.net/forum).</a><br><br>The neat thing: If you are in a browser (IE, Firefox, Opera or Chrome at the moment) and press Casplock+a to add a new task, the url of the website you're on is automatically copied into the url field. And if you start working on a task with a url, it gets opened automatically.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2010 at 19:25 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very cool Andreas-- can't wait to check it out...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2010 at 19:34 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It is rather useful. I use gmail and star each email that has a task attached to it and archive all others. Now I can press Capslock+a while haven a mail with a task open and add it to my DWM list. Once it decide to action the task, the original email pops up as reference. I really like it.<br><br>Another thing: The url is not restricted to websites. It can be anything your OS can handle. For example if the task is "Write essay", the url copy be "D:\reference\essay\draft.doc", which would open Word with your essay draft if you action the task. Or the task "write to Andreas" could have the url "mailto:andreas@autofocus.cc". Or you could use a skype url to call somebody etc. etc. <br><br>But I think I'll add an option to turn the auto-copy feature on or off. If you spend a lot of time in the browser you may not want to always have your current url attached to new tasks.

Right now all I get is "Does X feel ready to be done?" I'm not familiar with this kind of program. Sorry!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2010 at 1:00 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel:<br><br>The hotkeys I use most are Capslock+a a for adding tasks, Capslock+d for doing/circling through the tasks, and Capslock+e to show the complete list as a HTML page. The latter is what you're looking for, I think. It gives you the whole list, the current task is in bold font. If you have javascript enabled, you can show or hide unactioned/done/dismissed tasks via the buttons on the top right. And the list is grouped depending on your selected system (by page for AF1/AF3. by closed and open list for AF4, by expiration date for DWM). If you use DWM (remember, you can always switch the system you use in the preferences), tasks that expire today are marked red, tasks that expire tomorrow are marked yellow.<br><br>I originally intended for Capslock+a,s,d to be the main keys, but the "show next tasks" funktion on Capslock+s is rather useless compared to the HTML export. I plan to improve it in time, for example by enabling quick jump.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2010 at 5:30 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The difference between AutofocusAHK and most other digitial implementations is that AutofocusAHK takes care of the rules for you. Whether that's an advantage or not probably depends on how you're wired. Personally, I prefer the increased "autofocus" of only seeing one task at a time and answering the "do it?" question with yes or no, letting the application take care of which task to show me and where to add new tasks. Others might prefer manually adhering to the rules to increase psychological benefits by the process itself.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2010 at 5:36 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt; Personally, I prefer the increased "autofocus" of only seeing one task at a time and answering the "do it?" question with yes or no, letting the application take care of which task to show me and where to add new tasks.  &lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, this is what attracts me to AFAHK. Automatic strict enforcement of the rules, else I tend to bend the rules. Just downloaded ver 0.9.3.2. Will try AFAHK on sample tasks first, while my current active DWM is still in my Lotus Notes Todo and Windows Mobile Outlook Tasks. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2010 at 18:50 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AndreasH earlier said ...<br>&gt;&gt; I'm working on a websync solution, but I don't know how long it will take. I don't have as much time for this as I'd like. &lt;&lt;<br><br>Would this have some big advantage over syncing via dropbox between multiple computers?<br><br>I just double checked that dropbox don't have a windows mobile client. But accessing the dropbox webpage from WM browsers (IE Mobile or Iris) is do able. When on windows mobile I guess I could work from either AFAHK tasks.txt or the exported HTMLs files.<br><br>Mmm ...  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2010 at 19:20 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>sabre23t:<br><br>&lt;&lt;Would this have some big advantage over syncing via dropbox between multiple computers?&gt;&gt;<br><br>Well, dropbox is fine to sync between two PCs, but when I say web sync, that includes sync with a web application which can be used to work the list, which would also work in mobile browsers and non-windows computers. So it will probably make it a lot more useful. But its also a rather complex task, it's the one AutofocusAHK related task I feel the most resistance toward. So there'll likely be some more releases an other new feature before web sync is done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2010 at 22:22 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi AdreasH,<br><br>&gt;&gt; web sync, that includes sync with a web application which can be used to work the list, which would also work in mobile browsers and non-windows computers &lt;&lt;<br><br>Wow. That's what I'm hoping for when I tried out your earlier <a rel="nofollow" href="http://autofocus.cc">http://autofocus.cc</a> (AF1 only web app) from my Windows Mobile. Let me know, what I can do to assist on getting the web sync nearer realisation. ;-)<br><br>At the moment I'm still considering whether I can live without working my DWM list on my windows mobile (only reference access to dropbox), hence can use AFAHK instead of my existing NotesTodo/WMTasks setup. The following pros draws me to AFAHK ...<br>(1) Strict automatic adherence to DWM rules.<br>(2) Automatic tracking of time doing DWM per tasks.<br>(3) Re-entered tasks, are created as duplicate/rephrased copy of completed tasks.<br>(4) Nice auto URL link to webpages being worked on, with notes field.<br><br>I'll let the above brews a bit more before I make a decision. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2010 at 7:58 | sabre23t</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
