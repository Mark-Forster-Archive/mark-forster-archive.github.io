Personally, I'm trying to get to a state of mind where I can do any task put in front 100% of the time (assuming it is the right task to do at that particular time). In my view this is quite a challenge. How many of us can say they get into that state of "doing" all the time? I wish I could. Getting there, but it is hard.

I am personally a long-lister, so I'm not sure that my idea applies to your situation. However, when I encounter a sense of overwhelm or confusion from having to sift through too many entries, I fall back on:<br><br>"If I could only get ONE of these things started today, which would it be?"<br><br>I feel that this question is reliable for zooming in on the most critical work, but the benefits go a bit further. Once I'm satisfied with my choice, I find that I'm also much more comfortable with the fact that I'm NOT working on any of the other list entries.<br><br>Of course, I rarely ever only work on one item per day. The question holds up to repeated applications.<br><br>--V</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 September 2018 at 20:03 | Voluntas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If I can chime in with the "official" answer:<br><br>For simple scanning and similar systems using a Long List you do the first task that stands out as ready to be done. No question is necessary, and indeed questions should be avoided. You just trust the system. If you do this properly you will avoid feelings of overwhelm.<br><br>For FP and related systems, the question  I prefer is "What do I want to do before...?" Again, trust the system - and don't attempt to define what you mean by "want".<br><br>For No List systems, write down the first tasks that come into your head. This allows your intuition full play.<br><br>The great thing to remember is that whether you write all your work down in one list, or write a selection, or just write a few tasks, the total amount of work you have remains the same. You can choose whether to write it all down or just a small bit of it, but it's all still there and it all needs doing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 September 2018 at 20:59 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;For No List systems, write down the first tasks that come into your head.

It is a bit more complex but that is more or less it.<br>Interested how any one else handles really long lists. <br>Nb I'm not overloaded, I just have an enormous number of quick tasks and can function perfectly well with a biggish backlog.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2018 at 7:31 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mr Backlog:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I found I could not scan that many and I just lost track. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I can understand that happening with FVP, but I'm not clear what the advantage of three lists is with Simple Scanning. Simple Scanning more or less automatically sorts your tasks into Do It Now, Do a Bit Later and Do a Lot Later. The tasks arrive unsorted but the Do It Later tasks will gravitate to the earlier pages of the list.<br><br>I don't know how you decide which of your three lists you are going to be working on at any one time, but Simple Scanning has the advantage that you don't consciously have to make that decision.<br><br>I suspect you also have to spend some time re-prioritizing tasks. Again that doesn't need to happen with Simple Scanning.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2018 at 15:59 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum: &lt;&lt; what would you do if the first task is always pleasure-seeking, low-hanging fruit type of tasks? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Mark: &lt;&lt; I'd say "Go for it!" &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes! One of the common reasons for struggling is low (or disregulated) dopamine. Dopamine is the reward chemical, also anticipation of a reward, aka motivation. If it's low, it's very difficult to do anything. Yet we're often told to "eat the frog first." Do the most difficult task when our motivation and confidence is at its lowest. Doing something pleasurable will raise your dopamine so you can do something more difficult.<br><br>That's not to say that hours getting a new high score on a game, or on FaceBook, are good choices, or a book that keeps you turning pages all day. Ideally, choose something productive, especially if you stop when your dopamine is high enough to make it eating the frog easier, and you have enough energy (and time) left to eat it.<br><br>There are times, though, when clearing your social media backlog (often learning that nothing urgent was waiting) is the most useful thing you can do in the moment.<br><br>Other things to raise dopamine and other helpful neurotransmitters, and lower the unhelpful ones (eg cortisol): 1) Slow-burn foods. Protein, fat, complex carbs. I also like a hit (bolus) of simple sugar to get things started. 2) Exercise: Again, enough to raise the helpful neurotransmitters without using all your energy. 3) Social connection: What works for you in the moment. Coffee room. Check email. Social media. Metta bhavana meditation. 4) Gratitude. Our brain is unfair, and pays more attention to bad things (s.t.tigers) than good (carrot). Gratitude helps give good things an equal chance. 5) Anything you can succeed at, no matter how small: Success raises dopamine. Also, laughter at the silliness of doing something so tiny often breaks inertia.<br><br>(And...remember the bit about not spending hours?

I'm using my intuition at that early stage to drop it into the relevant time dependent list. I can then forget about it knowing it will be done within the timescale I originally decided.<br>I just work through the lists keeping an eye out on the older task to make sure they don't get too old past the timescale set for each list. I know the urgent tasks as all in one place which is comforting knowing they won't be missed.<br><br>The only problem I found with the long list was when I lost control of what needed doing at the right time purely due to the long length. I then started to do everything that came in just because I knew if went in the long list it would get lost or not done for ages.<br>I wonder if a long list works fine if not too long. I don't know. I just found splitting it works really well for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 September 2018 at 10:06 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mr. B: That is my impression.  Yes the things you want to act on soon do clump at the end and you get a few strikes at them as they mill about but that isn't quite enough.  The most pressing item needs more "oftens" than you can get before you swing around and have to spend a lot of time going through the vast amount of "not ready yet" items.  This is why I have often favored a system that does pull out the ready items and focus on them only for a period until you're ready to branch out.  <br><br>I think 3 lists is more than required to handle this.  Also, because I am currently keeping my list very short, 2 lists is not needed either for me.<br><br>Mark:<br>&gt; If I can chime in with the "official" answer:<br><br>Very interesting, so the way to focus on the most impactful items in your view is to not even think about the question but to simply trust the system.  The more you interact intuitively the more you will graduate to the things that matter.  Do I understand your position right?<br><br>Cricket:<br><br>Very well written and helpful discourse on dopamine depletion and replenishment.

In my view just easier to work within email itself and if you have Outlook then easy to set up folders with the urgency headings and drop emails into the appropriate folders and work from there.<br>I suppose it all boils down to "doing" tasks and how to manage them so they are done at the right time. I think all systems work well when the list is not too long, but as soon as it gets really long the system somehow needs to cope with the demands of new tasks coming in and also managing the older tasks that go into backlog.<br>Did you ever use the Linenberger system and what did you think of it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2018 at 10:17 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>mark: <br><br>Above, you stated: <br><br>&lt;&lt;I'd say "Go for it!"&gt;&gt;<br><br>I've been thinking about that, and wondered you were being a bit flippant.

I label email by project (including "read later, if every") rather than urgency, except for really urgent (which get a star).<br><br>I think I stopped using it the same day I started, but I liked it enough to buy the book. Asking, "What problems does this system solve that my current system doesn't?" was a good exercise. My system had many problems that I hadn't identified as such! Things I want to deal with soon buried under things that should wait. Too many things on today's list (and this week's list). Not reviewing the next list up often enough (not trusting that I'll do it). Ask of each item, "How long before I should think about it again."
