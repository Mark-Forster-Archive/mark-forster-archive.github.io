AF didn't really solve this for me, it just presented me with a larger list that reminded me daily (or hourly) of what I still had not done.  In using DIT, I frequently put on my schedule more than a days work-the problem being that while the advice that you can't get everything done and here is the proof you're overloaded is nice, the reality is that I must try to accomplish everything even if only half-assed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2010 at 20:18 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To me, after one year with DIT, I was happy and productive most of the time. However, I was usually very slow in pursuing fun or different things for the fear I would not get to them tomorrow. That is, if I had an idea of a new thing to study, for instance, it would never make it to my tomorrow's list. When I had free time, well, I just filled it with the same old hobbies / website reading / the old same.<br><br>With AF I could then just throw those ideas there and follow up on some of them -- and some of them were dismissed in the process. I am OK with tthat. I am more than thrilled of being able to follow on some important and fun stuff that I did manage to get to, and some of them got done last year *because* of AF.<br><br>A side effect of AF is that I finally learned to incorporate the "little and often" approach into my workflow. I was usually too stressed out to finish my list in DIT to consider *really* applying the "little and often" in a way it worked for me. Current initiatives also dragged for a long time; of course that was because I usually treatead the wrong things as CIs.<br><br>I remember in the first alpha versions of AF (still in 2008, I remember a blog post by Marl with a seminal idea of a running list), I said I would never consider abandoning DIT. Now I would say I don't see myself abandoning AF4, but of course I know better. I have bitten the bullet before. Let me just see how DIT2 goes. :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2010 at 21:24 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello TK,<br><br><br>&gt;&gt; the reality is that I must try to accomplish everything<br><br>But it can't be done. It is simple math. When you are getting more work, than you can accomplish, your backlog will grow and grow and grow. No system will solve that problem for you. You have to solve that, either by reducing the amount of work you and others will try to put on you and/or by dismissing old tasks on your backlog. <br><br>Don't get me wrong. It is perfectly OK to get more tasks that you can accomplish in your inbox every day. You just have to decide one day, that you are not going to do some of them. That process is called dismissal. I have a long AF history in by notebook. It is always nice to look at old entries, just to see how many 'very important tasks' never needed to be done in the first place. The world still turns, the boss didn't notice that the tasks had never been done, the customers are still happy.<br><br>But as important as dismissal, it is important to manage expectations. I had to learn that. The most important part of that for me was, not to think that i had failed. You have to be organized and you have to work effectively. That is all you can do. If that is the case, and you can not keep up with the incoming work, than it is not your fault.<br><br>DIT helped me to manage expectations, AF helped me to learn to dismiss tasks. Currently i am using my own combination of DIT and AF (more DIT than AF, because it is better at putting a firewall around my day). Needless to say, that i am very interested in DIT2 ;-)<br><br>Have a nice weekend,<br>scameronde</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2010 at 21:43 | scameronde</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt; The most important part of that for me was, not to think that i had failed. <br><br>Oh, yes! That is very important with AF too. A task rewritten is not a failure, it is an accomplishment! I task dismissed is not a failure either. I did not get that feeling with DIT.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2010 at 21:54 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I believe many people felt DIT a bit too rigid, whereas AF brought a lot af flexibility - may be too much, for those who need boundaries to keep focused on their working day's important stuff (count me in). If, as I hope, DIT2 brings the backlog and dismissal methods learned in AF experience into a DIT frame, we might get a system that accepts differences between workdays, manages them, and filters out the unnecessary actions - all within a structured workday perimeter. I am really eager to read Mark's instructione for DIT 2 !</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 9:11 | Alexborne</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>scameronde:<br><br>You have put it very well in your thoughtful post. <br><br>My new DIT2/AF5 system will hopefully make the dismissal process a bit easier.<br><br>[Afternote: I've now published the outline of it on my blog]</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 11:04 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
