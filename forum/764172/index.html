In my opinion, it's to filter out those things that you thought at the time you entered them that you *should* be doing, but which you really don't have to do - and don't really want to do.  <br><br>I don't dismiss when I run into the situation you describe which I have quite regularly, whether it's due to weather (can't wash the car when it's -20), timing (a page left with only tasks that require a larger time commitment than I have available from Monday-Friday after work or stores aren't open) or, like your situation, where they are location specific items.  With regards to the location specific items, when I enter steps on a project that I'm working on in a batch, that could amount to a full page of items, yet I may only be in that location once a week or less.   You can bet that the next time I'm in that location, I'll be working exclusively from those location-specific pages though.  In theory, you could write down an item / project "computer tasks" and have a separate context list, but why bother with the overhead?<br><br>I run into the same situation when I'm at work doing items from my home book during my lunch hour or on my commute.  For me, it's progress that I do anything at all from my home book during my working day, so I just cherry pick something on any of the pages that I feel like doing.  <br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 May 2009 at 20:57 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree wholeheartedly with Jacqueline.

If your rule is that you will only dismiss an item if it relates to your current context, then that is going to affect how you approach that item on previous passes through that page, and consequently how you approach the other items on the same page. And because your intuition is looking at the list as a whole as well as the page you are currently on, the rule change will affect the way you approach every item on the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 May 2009 at 23:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>I am curious -- how do you approach tasks on your lists when you are at a place where they cannot be done -- or do not have the tools, or whatever?

I may have a number of new tasks in this category, so they don't fit into the context of being on my lists for a long time.  So when in that situation, I go through my AF lists and encounter tasks that say out to me "yes, need and want to do this -- when I am back in my office this afternoon".  If those are the only remaining tasks on the page, why should I dismiss them?  I guess I don't understand your position on this.  IF the tasks were indeed on a page where they had been for some time, then maybe....but even then...I can't see dismissing tasks simply because I happen to be in a place at the moment where they can't be done.<br><br>Please elaborate some more on this.

If you can't do the items due to where you are physically, don't dismiss them. Wait till you are able to do them. If you decide when you get home you are not going to do them, then dismiss them. This seems to be obvious.<br><br>The only caveat is if you decide to live in the coffee shop to avoid going home to do the tasks.<br><br>It ain't that complicated.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2009 at 14:43 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Norman,<br><br>I agree - this is in line with my thoughts exactly!

I guess if you invited me (at vast expense!) to come and observe you working so that I could advise you on the best practice for your situation, the first thing I'd look at would be the reasons why you take your AF list with you when you leave your office.

I take my AF notebook with me and work on the plane sometimes and definitely in my hotel room at night.  If I encounter important tasks on a page and they again say "yes, do me as soon as you are back to your office", and they are the only ones on that particular page -- there may be many - I see no reason to dismiss them.  I just acknowledge that I cannot do them as I am not in my office and move on to another page.<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2009 at 18:56 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David:<br><br>My practice when attending conferences and such like is to have a separate notebook for  travelling. I would only put into it those tasks which I need as part of the travelling (e.g. finalise conference presentation, book table for dinner, confirm return flight reservation, check email, etc.), plus specific projects which I have decided I will work on during the conference - which means I will take the necessary documents with me.<br><br>During the conference any additional tasks get added to the list as they come up. If tasks come up which I can only do at home, I make a note of them in my notetaking notebook (i.e. not my travelling AF one) and transfer them to my Home AF book on return, plus any uncompleted ones from the travelling book.<br><br>I find this works far better than carrying my main AF notebook with me all the time - as I said earlier that never leaves my desk.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2009 at 19:23 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>This is really nice!  Of course I decide on what documents and projects that I am taking with me -- along with my main AF notebook.  But your approach has really intrigued me.

It seems to me entirely practical to dismiss an item which has been through a number of passes and did not stand out. Later on, if I decide I want to do it, nothing is stopping me from doing that, and, it gives you the satisfaction of completing a page....</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2009 at 3:58 | Gordon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum:  Also consider that you can put multiple lists in the same notebook.  Some people (as I was just reminded this morning in another post) add work tasks from the top down on a page and from the bottom up on the same page and draw a line when they meet ... thus having two lists interspersed in one.  Others, like me, work from the front of the book for one list and from the back forward for another (in my case I have multiple short lists working from the back).  I even read where someone turns his book upside down for alternate lists.  There is no end to the creativity ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2009 at 10:43 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David:<br><br>One reason I would carry my list with me when I traveled would be that I would want to be able to write things in it when they occurred to me.  IOW, when I'm traveling for work I don't stop thinking about home, so I want to be able to keep ADDING to that list, even if nothing is being DONE on it just then.  My mind is ADD plagued so I'm always buzzing with ideas about things in one context while I'm in another.  Very perverse, but I have learned the futility of fighting it ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2009 at 10:46 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another possible take on this: when none of the remaining tasks can be done, you can just pick one and do some thinking or planning on it (even if it's only deciding when or where it can best be progressed). And according to the standard AF rules, this allows you to cross it off, re-enter it at the end and move on to the next page. Without dismissing anything ;)<br><br>Apart from that, Mark's comment that you most probably encountered the task several times when you had the possibility to work on it and didn't, and thus that it won't harm to dismiss it, seems quite sensible. Simply add it back at the next "Review dismissed items" action...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2009 at 14:30 | Marc (from Brussels)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Marc - intuitively, I started doing "thinking" on those tasks, and reentered it.

So I gave it a try, and my problems were solved. This is how it works for me:<br><br>* Both of them are always with me (I actually use a file that I can access from everywhere). The items on my "Work List" aren't necessarily work-related, there are LOTS of things that are personal, but I can do that when I'm working (paying a bill through the internet, et c).<br><br>* Many items appear on both lists, and this proved very efficient for me, especially when considering that my home list is rather neglected when compared to the other one.<br><br>* Sometimes I write in my work list "Review home list", and I when I reach that task, I give the whole home list a read, without performing anything, and without dismissing. It's just a read to verify that I'm not missing anything important. If that happens, I schedule a proper time to process my home list when I'm there.<br><br>* Since I started using two lists, I can dismiss without fear. In fact, I learned that "dismissing" is an amazing tool. Sometimes, when I reach that point, I actually feel relief, since the tasks I'm "freezing" were causing me guilt, and this way I can take a little distance from them and forget them for a while. But this is another topic anyway, just wanted to point it out.<br><br><br>I would suggest you to try keeping two or more lists.
