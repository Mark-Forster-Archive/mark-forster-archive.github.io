By "project" I mean any activity you set out to do, large or small, that requires one or more action in the future.<br><br>Project management on the company level seems to be a fairly robust discipline, with lots of large textbooks, certifications and whatnot. Many universities offer programs in project management. It strikes me that these systems could also be applied to personal time and project management.<br><br>Wondering if anyone has been involved with project management in the workplace, and whether it is applicable at all to managing a set of personal projects? Is it total overkill? Can it just be boiled down to making a simple Gantt chart in Excel?<br><br>If so, any software you would recommend? I got an email the other day for Microsoft Project, and it got me wondering whether it would be worth taking the time to master this software (or something similar).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2015 at 1:33 | Simon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For simple personal projects, I love how CAF4 worked for me,<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2446303">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2446303</a><br><br>There was the problem of outpacing the "Backlog" that I noted but aside from that I still highly recommend trying it if you want to incorporate project handling to an AF-like time management scheme. <br><br>An improvement to it would be to use a two-week dismissal system like what I am using now.

The Wikipedia page (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management)</a> is packed with different approaches. <br><br>This seems to be a well-developed discipline, but it also seems to have a lot in common with what we talk about here. Yet it never seems to find its way into the personal time/project management discussion. Is that because it is more suited to the business environment? <br><br>Can anything concepts/techniques be borrowed from the discipline of project management and applied to one's personal life?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2015 at 14:15 | Simon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Simon,<br><br>I was a PM for a long time and I've also played around a lot with personal productivity. I've made a few attempts to translate what I would do at work into plans at home, mostly just for practice, but they've never stuck. The most successful were simplified versions of scrum and kanban. <br><br>I think most of the overhead and process of project management at work is aimed at communication, consensus, co-ordination, direction and accountability and they are all handled face to face and informally in the much smaller realm of my personal life. <br><br>I do from time to time plan out elements of my personal life using whatever tool is at hand, from pen and paper to electronic planning. I rarely rigidly follow up though, its more that planning seems to be a good clarification exercise from time to time. The results then usually end up on my AF list, or in the bin.<br><br>The closest I've seen to a useful personal PM process is David Allen's Five Phases of Project Planning. This is simply enough to hold in my head and I sometimes use it mentally to help flesh out a plan.<br><br>Hope that's useful...<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2015 at 14:31 | Matt Gregory</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Simon: In response to your specific mention of MS Project, my recommendation is NO if you'd have to pay for the software yourself AND you don't hope/plan to pursue a career in project management. I don't know if Project is really the best, but I do know that it will look very good on your resume if that's where you want to go. (I'm sure it will look even better if you have other tools on your resume too, but most places I've been in the last 10 years have used Project or something very similar.)<br><br>As for whether or not it's overkill for managing personal projects, it probably is. If your personal projects involve other people who may be involved in other projects that you are also managing and tracking in Project, and you're allocating percentages of their time and so on, it could be helpful. Or if you love to get wrapped up in overly elaborate scheduling as a way to get out of doing the actual work, Project would certainly fit the bill. ;-)<br><br>But if you do a little Googling you'll find Excel templates that can draw Gantt charts for you, if that's what you like. If your personal projects aren't quite so schedule-oriented, there are some mindmapping tools that can lay things out in a two-dimensional format with an emphasis on relationships and dependencies. (Project can also do a relationship map of sorts, but I don't know anyone who uses it. I don't know if that means it's useless, or just not useful to anyone I know.)<br><br>Bottom line is that these corporate-level methodologies and tools are meant to track the time and cost of multiple complex projects involving many overlapping tasks, people, equipment, facilities, dependencies, etc. to make sure that they are on budget. And very often there is a Project Manager whose entire job is to manage the project so that other people can perform their own tasks without having to worry about the bean-counting.<br><br>Most likely, very little of this applies to your personal projects. So again, unless you are interested in PM as a career, this stuff may not help you much. On the other hand, you can certainly study it as a hobby if you find it interesting, and decide for yourself how much time and expense you want to devote to it (keeping in mind that this would be a project in its own right, taking time away from your other projects).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2015 at 16:20 | JulieBulie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The answer is: you don't want Project Management for personal projects. MS Project is overkill and over complex for any project less than 10 people. <br><br>What you really need is a notebook or a folder. Log what you're doing if you want. Brainstorm on a piece of paper. Make an outline of parts to address. Collect materials. Occasionally add something to your general todos. That is everything.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2015 at 16:29 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>MS project is way too complex for me. I have used Merlin on another Mac - also quite sophisticated but fun to use, too, and I don't have to mortgage my house to buy it. But not really needed for me. I do keep an app called "SG project" in case I have a very complicated event, it's also a lot of fun to use, and very simple. One book I really liked on project management was the One Page Project Manager - I forget who wrote it. But in all these things, David Allan's approach is the simplest - I look at it as a process which can be as complicated or as simple as I need it to be to get it done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2015 at 16:55 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great, thanks. It does sound as though MS Project is a bit too complex for day to day life, unless you are planning a wedding while trying to run a business.<br><br>I thought MS Project (or a similar but simpler program) might be good for corralling a small group of core projects and imposing a bit of structure to ensure they are completed by a certain date. But, I suppose pen and paper works just as well as complicated software.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 May 2015 at 18:36 | Simon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have already shared that I found AgendaGuru (www.agendaguru.com) and it is perfect rescheduling tasks in my agenda!!<br>I had a major issue with my deadlines and, as a consequence, I had to work all night long to compensate...<br>I thought it would be good to have a software that would automatically reschedule my tasks in the calendar, until I finished the one I was working on and I found one that does precisely that: AgendaGuru and it seems to be extraordinarily simple!<br>It is still a beta version and only available online for computers...

The size of the buffer depends on the typical variation you would find in the factory. A bigger buffer offers more protection but comes at higher cost -- greater lead teams, greater carrying costs, more difficulty in managing and prioritizing the buffer, etc. So it becomes an economic decision -- you choose a buffer size that will cover whatever level of variation you decide to protect against, for the given cost. <br><br>In project management, the buffer is a time buffer that protects the whole critical path, rather than having safety time embedded in each task. You basically move all the safety out of each task, and aggregate it into one large buffer. Managing a project's schedule then becomes a matter of managing that buffer. And essentially that buffer is your primary tool for managing all the uncertainty and risk in the project. If you are in a very volatile or uncertain environment, you might choose to use a larger buffer. <br><br>In supply chain, you are essentially creating buffers for each product, component, and subcomponent in your whole supply chain. The buffers are sized to respond to the changing lead times and uncertainties both upstream in the preceding supply chain and in the downstream demand for each item. <br><br>In all these cases, you can also adjust the buffer sizes dynamically based on changing circumstances. Nowadays this is a really big issue with supply chains -- COVID has been very disruptive, lead times have increased, and supplies are less reliable. A TOC-managed supply chain will respond dynamically to this situation by resizing the buffers. You can be proactive about this and simulate different future scenarios -- for example, estimating what buffer size you would need if the lead times for a part suddenly doubled, or demand suddenly changed, etc.. You can then craft a strategy that addresses the changes. For example, if lead times double, and this causes your buffers to get too large (requiring too much cash outlay, or building up inventories that could outlast the life of your product), it gives you enough visibility into the situation to take appropriate action -- finding alternate suppliers, redesigning your product roadmap, etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 May 2021 at 5:21 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>Then maybe the fact that buffers weren't central stage in The Goal was what caused me to query the robustness of its methods?

I have come across TOC and I personally see it's place in lean, though some might argue they are different.  I see them both as trying to optimise the delviery of value, without being fooled into trying to blindly maximise utilisation at indiviudal steps in a process, which in many cases decreases rather than increases the delivery of value.    <br>- Kanban is all about making things visual.  <br>- 4DX has a four step process that you can see in their book.    <br>and LOTS (I mean LOTS!!!!)  more from FVP to GTD to OKRs etc... <br><br>The six steps I use are<br>1 - Know the situation - Make your work visible.  Know what you currently do.  Use kanban boards and value stream boards.  <br>2 - Know the mission - Make sure you know where your primary goal or objective.     <br>3 - Know the plan - Determine the best strategy to reach your goal.  Know the key results that will deterrmine if you are successful. <br>4 - Know the score - Keep a highly visible scoreboard, which lets you know when you are succeeding in reaching your key results and goals. <br>5- Build a winning culture - Check in and connect your measurable actions to your victories.  <br>6- Level up - Repeat and improve<br><br>BEST TOOLS  <br>- Record Breaker Ops Matrix - you can get a copy at https://recordbreaker.com.au/opsmatrix/<br>I am making improvements on this matrix as I go, but in keeping with lean and agile principles, I am releasing a beta version :)  Would love to get your feedback.  <br>- I also have a simplified version at https://bit.ly/3oWJum7<br><br>Best kanban tool (both tools are best value for money) I find kanbanflow better for personal use, but kanbanzone for clients as it looks a bit flashier.  Kanban flow also has great time tracking (including pomodoros if you are into that) that kanbanzone can't match at the moment.  <br>- Kanban Zone<br>https://kanbanzone.com/rb/  This affiliate link gets you slightly longer trial.  Really good software, and always making improvements.<br>- Kanban Flow<br>https://kanbanflow.com/board/xC3E5To<br><br>I just want to add emphasis to how awesome I think the Ops Matrix is, especially combined with a permanent scoreboard.  You can get a copy of a google sheets scoreboard at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AoEAp88LcHUSOVIVrPCbJtCcpTPQldUjF7nGge0GAxo/copy?usp=sharing<br><br>You can make the scoreboard full screen on a dedicated scoreboard monitor, and zoom in or out to the right size in chrome holding ctrl + alt + (+ or -)<br><br>The Ops Matrix is great because I discovered that my ops matrix scores were effectively a lead measure as well as a lag measure.  It is also a great way of managing all the repeating tasks that tend to clog up most GTD and FVP style systems.  I love these sytems by the way, I just feel like I have worked out a better solution that can work with FVP as well if you want it to.  As usual, most of us are trying bits and pieces of various systems anyway, so I am just suggesting that the ops matrix can work for you too.  <br><br>I hope this doesn't sound inapproprate or salesy.  That is not my intention.  In a nut shell, I have made some free spreadsheets that you might find useful, and recommended the two best kanban tools that fit a reasonable budget based on extensive testing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 November 2021 at 9:44 | John Wilkinson</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The best Project management software depends on your specific needs, team size, budget, and project requirements.
