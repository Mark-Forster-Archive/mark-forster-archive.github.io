Posting here you will be open to feedback from all of us and Mark.<br><br>The reason I want you to post here, is I might be open to try, but I may or may not want to be directly and deeply involved in the BETA, until I read about and decide how if interested.

I've been using some variation of what I posted for the past year or so. <br><br>&lt;&lt;that I need to know a bit more about how it actually works out in practice&gt;&gt;<br><br>In time, I'd like to create a similar video to the one you did in the hotel lobby for AF. Where you walked the user through the rules, using a real page from your AF notebook. <br><br>However my first task is to tweak the system, keep using it myself and slowly introduce it into my private practice with clients. <br><br>&lt;&lt;having difficulty grasping... these seem very much the sort of things one does with any system&gt;&gt;<br><br>The focus of my system is capturing a narrative using the title portion of Evernote notes. So during a weekly (or annual) review, a tale is told about your thoughts, feelings and actions. The question than becomes... do you like this tale? Is it representative of your best "principled" thinking, or not? <br><br>It's a hybrid journal and task/project management system, minus the bits that weren't working for me. Specifically: <br><br>Journaling: Lends itself to long, rambling thoughts that I tend to ignore. Also, very hard to categorize by project. In my system, because each note is tagged with a project, you're able to either read your narrative chronologically (as mentioned in the video), or sort by project, and see your progress (or not)  that way. <br><br>Task/project management: I never received the dopamine rush of crossing off tasks. Worse, at the end of my week, my completed tasks didn't teach me anything. <br><br>With some refinements, a client would be able to share their notebook with me, and by simply reading the titles (as laid out in the video), I could get a sense of their journey... what they stand for, where they're stuck, and what they're moving towards.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 August 2016 at 12:16 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I haven't watched the video or dug into this in any detail, but from the description in this last post, it sounds similar to iDoneThis. I like the idea of how you are emailing to Evernote to capture it. That might be a good way for me to implement iDoneThis if I find limitations in the tool that I don't like.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 August 2016 at 18:50 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>iDoneThis has just done a major upgrade.

One of the things I tried recently was noting a problem and then writing down my action in response to the problem. I thought of it as a chess game and I was taking notation on the moves. The situation was the opponent and then I'd note what I did my move (hopefully a good strategic one!) It was motivating because you could first notice something that needed an action taken before deciding on the action (if any).<br><br>I like that it has the potential of being a journal. I wonder if each section could have a small no-list in it. For example if you combined it with "the next hour of your life", you would choose a new list whenever the situation changed or maybe take notes as you work the list on what the context was at the time.<br><br>You mentioned taking notes after your actions to reflect on how it went (what to do different for example). That's similar to some things I would note in my chess notation which is similar to how people add comments in actual chess notation (particularly bad/good moves etc).<br><br>I like that it asks "what is the best use of my time right now?" I was actually just thinking about that as a key question to a system prior to reading this thread, but not knowing how to apply it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 August 2016 at 2:14 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;I like that it asks "what is the best use of my time right now?" I was actually just thinking about that as a key question to a system prior to reading this thread, but not knowing how to apply it.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Covey suggested doing something similar during your weekly planning session. But I didn't find it helpful -  because what I thought would be "the best use of my time" five days from now, will obviously change minute to minute. I prefer asking the question in the moment, writing down my answer, and then (possibly) doing what I set out to do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 August 2016 at 2:46 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum, i've watched the 2nd video ( by the time I got to the 1st, seems not to be there anymore?). i'll attempt to summarize what i understood. please let me know if/what i got right/wrong.<br><br>this system is good for those who are not so good at long term careful make and follow a detailed plan/tasks.<br><br>for those that might by temperament live moment to moment?<br><br>so to get self control over their life, and to work WITH this way of being, you ask them to be more self aware of what is going on in the moment. everything from what they think needs to be done, want to do, options, mood, weather? their entire situation in the moment.<br><br>and to, instead of write something such as<br><br>"make breakfast"<br><br>to instead write<br><br>"i am hungry, it will be 3 hours until i get a chance to eat again, i have work i need to do now, usually when i just dive into work and forget to eat i then crash in 1 hour and as just said, it will be 3 hours until i get a chance to eat again ... SO i will make a healthy breakfast NOW and then work for 3 hours on my project"<br><br>and at the end of day, week, month or whenever review what did, a story will emerge that is more useful to just read that on Tuesday i made breakfast<br><br>this story will be useful for the person and if needed, useful for a professional working with them<br><br>is that close?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 August 2016 at 18:31 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;this system is good for those who are not so good at long term careful make and follow a detailed plan/tasks&gt;&gt;<br><br>Primarily, the system is designed to answer two questions: <br><br>1. What is the story of your week? Month, etc. <br>2. How can you use this information to better align your principles with your actions - to live a meaningful life. <br><br>I’d imagine this system is best suited for people who are naturally drawn to journaling, therapy, increasing self-knowledge.<br><br>&lt;&lt;everything from what they think needs to be done, want to do, options, mood, weather? their entire situation in the moment.&gt;&gt;<br><br>The thinking behind the first question (context) is to help you understand two things:<br><br>1. How the context (weather, mood, place, time) impacted your choice of “principled action"<br>2. how the context may have impacted what you actually did <br><br>It also supports the narrative idea. So, when you re-read your entries from last year, the context will help flesh out the drama of what was going on - internal and external - in your life at that time. <br><br>&lt;&lt;“i am hungry, it will be 3 hours until i get a chance to eat again, i have work i need to do now, usually when i just dive into work and forget to eat i then crash in 1 hour and as just said, it will be 3 hours until i get a chance to eat again ... SO i will make a healthy breakfast NOW and then work for 3 hours on my project”&gt;&gt;<br><br>As discussed in the video, I use the title bar in Evernote to capture a one line journal entry. I like the limitation of one line - it avoids me rambling on and on... something I will not read at the end of the week. If I were to write your entry, it might read something like this:<br><br>Context (what is happening right NOW):<br> I am hungry, my day is packed, and I won’t get to eat for another few hours.<br><br>Best Action (Choosing the best action given one’s mood, energy, tools, etc): <br>I will make a healthy breakfast.<br><br>I dropped “and then work for 3 hours on my project” because I would find “make a healthy breakfast” a challenging enough task/project. Once I finished eating, and returned to my computer, I would update Evernote, something like:<br><br>Context (what is happening right NOW):<br> Breakfast was delicious - feeling full and a bit lethargic. <br><br>Best Action (Choosing the best action given one’s mood, energy, tools, etc): <br>Still, I really need to make some headway on X project… off to do just that.<br><br>&lt;&lt;and at the end of day, week, month or whenever review what did, a story will emerge that is more useful to just read that on Tuesday i made breakfast&gt;&gt;<br><br>Bingo!!<br><br>&lt;&lt;is that close?&gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes - the basic idea. I’m still experimenting with how I phrase things to ensure there is drama to the narrative. It’s a lot more fun to read that way. <br><br>Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts matthewS.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 August 2016 at 20:44 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark Forster wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; iDoneThis has just done a major upgrade.
