It's as if I feel it isn't worth adding anything that will be finished in one go or not even done at all.  But, as a result, I have started keeping other lists, for the day-to-day stuff and for odds and ends.<br><br>On the one hand, it may work quite well to separate ongoing projects from trivia, but, on the other, it was always something I liked about AF1 that I didn't have to separate stuff at the outset - everything went on one list and was dealt with, as appropriate, when it stood out.<br><br>I'm not sure why this has happened - whether I have created some kind of mental barrier to using DWM as simply as I did AF1 - or whether it's the forward-looking emphasis of DWM, that makes me feel it's only appropriate for clearly defined work tasks. <br><br>Has anyone else noticed this?  I haven't  been using DWM for long, so maybe I'm still adjusting to the new perspective, but at the moment I am feeling quite nostalgic for AF1!  Should I go back to it?  Or, if I stick with DWM, should I accept that it doesn't cover everything I need to remember and keep other lists as well or make more of an effort to write down everything, as I used to with AF1?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 February 2010 at 17:30 | acedia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's YOU! (LOL!)<br><br>With DIT, I would always write something down before I did it, even if it wasn't previously on my list for today. With AF1-4, I couldn't do that. They were too restrictive. With DWM, I am doing it again and it feels great. I am so much more self-aware. One of the beautiful things about DWM is that there is essentially random access. I can go to any item at any time. So, I will write down the smallest thing.<br><br>All I can say is that it's worth trying. But you need to make sure that you have a lot of space available on your pages.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 February 2010 at 18:07 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I feel the same as Moises. I, however, have seen the number of things I write increasing from DIT, to each version of AF, to DWM. In my case, though, I have learned to really trust I will do things little and often and that the "system" will sort out whatever I am and am not going to do. So, yes, I am still dumping more and more things on my DWM list than ever.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 February 2010 at 21:57 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, moises!  I had a feeling it might be me, but your experience proves it!  Interesting that you find more freedom with DWM (and DIT) than AF, when I have been feeling just the opposite . . . but I really do want to try DWM to the full, as my great weakness with AF was dismissal and DWM seems to offer a very simple and effective way of dealing with that.<br><br>One thing I've been doing differently is using an online list, rather than paper.  As I am not sitting at a computer all day long, I only add items to the list once or twice a day, rather than as I think of them.  So tomorrow I will get a page-a-day diary and start again with a more AF state of mind.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 February 2010 at 22:38 | acedia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I too agree with moises.  Now that I back with DWM using a digital approach -- I feel very comfortable with throwing everything into the system.  I do sit in front of a computer a lot, so considering so much of my work is on the computer, going back to digital seemed to be the way to go.  I now have a pda that synchs with Outlook, so my calendar and tasks are now very mobile.<br><br>So far, so good....<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 February 2010 at 22:54 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Natalia: <br><br>That is the way it worked for me with AF - up to a point anyway.  But there was a gap when I wasn't using AF, before Mark unveiled DWM, so maybe I lost the feel for it.  I was working more off schedules and deadlines for a while.  Now I need to get back into the way of starting tasks early and working on them little and often.  <br><br>David:<br><br>Nice to know you're giving it another go!  I can see that a digital solution is good for anyone whose work is largely computer based.  Mine isn't, most of the time.  In fact, the less time I spend in front of a screen, the more I get done.  So it's back to paper for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 February 2010 at 23:44 | acedia</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
