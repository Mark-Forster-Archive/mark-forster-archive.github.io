She does have a variant of the future vision-current reality exercise in "Dreams". It goes like this.

And thanks for the kind words. I reminded myself that AF is meant to create the vision, so no need for A Future Vision (I suppose Mark might say).:  <br><br>"My vision for Autofocus is that through its unique sifting process we will have our goals and vision clarified for us. Perhaps it would be better to express that as “we will be able to clarify our goals and vision”, because Autofocus is after all no more than a framework to allow our intellect and our intuition to work in balance."<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/6/12/back-to-autofocus.html#comments">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/6/12/back-to-autofocus.html#comments</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2015 at 20:09 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>michael:<br><br>Funnily enough I was thinking about this this evening and even read the article you link to before I came across your post.<br><br>Yes, Autofocus (specifically the original one) is supposed to provide a framework for clarifying one's goals and vision.<br><br>It will only do this however if it is worked correctly. Specifically:<br><br>1) Projects can be entered at any level, but should be broken down into small tasks as quickly as possible. So it's best to start a project as "Plan Project X" rather than as just "Project X". The planning consists of breaking down the actions needed for Project X and entering them into the list. Some, or even perhaps most, of these actions will need breaking down further, so they can be entered as planning too, e.g. "Plan Publicity for Project X". This process goes on until you reach a specific concrete action, e.g. "Discuss Publicity for Project X with James".<br><br>2) The aim is to end up with a *lot* of small tasks. I used to think that Seraphim's (and some other people's) giant lists were quite wrong. But they work fine as long as the dismissal process is correctly used.<br><br>3) When you have a long list of say 500 or more tasks, it is essential to be prepared to dismiss a *lot* of tasks - sometimes even a whole page without having done any of the tasks on it. Any attempts to avoid dismissing tasks are fatal to the system.<br><br>4) AF is really a form of survival of the fittest. The tasks which fit your vision (even if you don't know what it is yet) will get done often and well, while other tasks will either languish and eventually get dismissed, or will get dismissed without having been done at all.<br><br>5) Also essential to the process is the review of dismissed tasks. This may lead to reinstatement of a task, but what is often forgotten is that it may also lead to final deletion of a task.<br><br>It's not quite relevant to the present discussion but another thing I would want to stress about AF is that "If it needs doing now, do it now" is part of the system, not a failure of the system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2015 at 21:44 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>What an excellent summary of AF.

(A common Kanban practice is to set rules such as "WIP limits" or "forward motion only", but instead of enforcing all these rules strictly, one does what makes sense at the time, and if a rule violation occurs, it should trigger a review to think about why the violation was necessary, and how to improve the organization of the process and flow so as to make similar violations unnecessary in the future).<br><br>A deeper review of dismissed items could be something more like this:<br><br>- Why do I keep dismissing tasks that my rational mind says are "important"?  What's the disconnect there?<br><br>- Am I dismissing too many of the small tasks connected with various projects, causing multiple projects to stall and none to be completed?   Is this a sign I have taken on too many commitments?<br><br>Stuff like that.  I'm pretty sure this kind of deeper reflection is what Mark had in mind all along, but I never got in the habit of taking review of dismissed items seriously enough to make it work like this.<br><br>It almost makes me want to try AF1 again as my main system.  :-)    But actually, this is essentially what I'm doing with DIT right now.   If I fall behind, I don't just do an audit of commitments, but have been asking myself these same kinds of questions, in conjunction with reviewing my "DONE" lists for the day, and it's been really helpful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2015 at 6:47 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim<br><br>&lt;&lt;Why do I keep dismissing tasks that my rational mind says are "important"?

What's the disconnect there? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Well just maybe it's because your "rational" mind is wrong! <br><br>I don't by the way like calling the conscious mind the rational mind because I think both the conscious and unconscious parts of your mind are rational - in fact in my experience my unconscious mind is often more rational than my conscious mind!<br><br>&lt;&lt; - Am I dismissing too many of the small tasks connected with various projects, causing multiple projects to stall and none to be completed? Is this a sign I have taken on too many commitments? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Something I've mentioned recently in another context is that we shouldn't be looking at what we haven't done but at what we have done. Assuming that we've actually been working and not goofing off, what we've done represents the amount of work that we can do in the time period in question. We couldn't have done anything else without leaving undone some of the stuff we did do.<br><br>It is in other words not a question of the quantity of what we've done but of its quality. The quantity is always the same.<br><br>If you approached it from this angle your question might become "Am I dismissing enough of the tasks connected with various projects which I wouldn't have had time to deal with in any case?"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2015 at 15:30 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum:<br><br>&lt;&lt; It's maddening how good AF (and most of your ideas) sound.

The problems come when for one reason or another I feel I want to change things. So for instance I come to a page which contains a lot of tasks I really don't want to do. The result is that I can't face even starting on the page. Result:  I go off and try another system - or stop working altogether.<br><br>What I should have done of course was simply calmly scan down the page item by item according to the rules and if something stood out I should have worked on it and if nothing stood out I should have dismissed the entire page, again according to the rules. <br><br>Nothing difficult about that - the system would still be intact and my resistance to the page would have been irrelevant.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2015 at 15:41 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>&lt;&lt;What I should have done...&gt;&gt;<br><br>So in your experience, is it the fault of the system i.e. AF produces pages with drudgery, the person i.e. lack of willpower?
