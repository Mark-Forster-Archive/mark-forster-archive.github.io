It's supposed to be the last for the time being, apart from bug fixes.<br><br>The author lists the following improvements/new features:<br><br>* The are a few cosmetic changes in reports (nothing big)<br>* When you place your mouse over the app icon in the System Tray,<br>  it will now display information about any playing or paused timers<br>  so you can easily keep track of your progress without opening<br>  the entire interface (no info will be displayed if there aren't<br>  any currently playing or paused timers)<br>* When you move a timer to a new timer group, it will be added as<br>  the LAST timer in the group instead of the first, as before<br>* HERE"S THE BIGGIE!: Timers remain activated, playing, paused, or<br>  completed when you reorder them, move them to a new group, or shut<br>  down the application! YAY! :) The only thing to be aware of here<br>  is that the countdown of time only continues when a timer is<br>  visible on the screen.<br><br>See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theactionmachine.com">http://www.theactionmachine.com</a><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 9:22 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like the new version! One annoyance I always had though is that The Action Machine is always hidden to the System Tray when I just want to minimize it - and then I forget to use it! So I made a small script to stop it minimizing to the tray. Posted here in case anyone else is interested! Just put ActionMachineNoTray.exe in \Program Files\The Action Machine\ and run it instead of ActionMachine.exe and the app will be kept on the Task bar instead of disappearing to the tray! It will just be put below all your other open windows! ;-)<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jonrumens.com/ActionMachineNoTray.zip">http://www.jonrumens.com/ActionMachineNoTray.zip</a><br><br>Tested on Vista.<br><br>Jon</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 16:34 | Jon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My problem with Action Machine is that it is very resource hungry.  It should be a small scale utility but in fact takes more resources on my PC than MS Office!<br><br>Jack</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2009 at 4:04 | Jack</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My problem with the Action Machine is - apart from its resource hunger - the unflexible gui. I have a 24'' wide screen with 1920x1600 and I use a tool called GridMove to arrange my apps in a grid. But the action machine never fits in, because it can't be resized in any sensible way. It sounds like a small thing, but it annoys me so much I stopped using it. Same goes for not being able to set the number of timers, rows and columns in a timer group. <br><br>Another thing that annoys me is that there is no trial version. I had to buy the thing to give it a try. Sure, there is a money back guarantee (which I don't think I can invoke at this point because it's to late), but what's the problem with offering a free trial version? The lack of a trial version combined with the huge amount of "marketing speak" on the homepage doesn't strike me as very professional - or maybe the wrong kind of professional.<br><br>Where the marketing speak really got to me was when Derek send me the link to his videos about "The Genius Mechanism". It sounded really interesting, but after watching the first of two videos, I felt slightly let down, because he said NOTHING AT ALL in that video, it was just advertisement for the second video (which he originally wanted to offer only to people who gave up their email address for it). And in the second video, I was even more disappointed that "The Genius Mechanism" was simply mind mapping. Not a new angle on mind mapping, a special technique, or anything revolutionary or innovative, just plain old mind mapping. He even says in the video it's just mind mapping but he calls it "The Genius Mechanism" for ... marketing reasons I guess.<br><br>So all in all The Action Machine is a nice idea, implemented with much room for improvement and huuuuuuge amount of hype. I don't know why the hype bothers me so much. Perhaps I'm jealous, but I would never even dream of charging 27$ for something like this, I would make it freeware. Like I did with autofocus.cc. But I guess that's my problem. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2009 at 11:23 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps I'm jealous, but I would never even dream of charging 27$ for something like this, I would make it freeware.

I felt I'd completely wasted my time watching the videos. As for the $27 for the Action Machine, he does give the basic philosophy behind it for free, and shows very clearly what it does in the videos - so, yes, it would be nice to have a trial period but at least he's not trying to hide anything.<br><br>As for sleeping well at night, my wife is always amazed at my ability to go to sleep the second my head hits the pillow and to wake up as the alarm clock goes off... giving stuff away free sure is a great cure for insomnia!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2009 at 16:38 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jack:<br><br>Not being a techie, I'm not sure what you mean by "resource hungry", but if you mean CPU usage the Action Machine doesn't seem to make much difference on my computer, although it's beginning to show its age quite badly now. I tried the program with two timers running and my CPU was showing 4-6% of usage, and when I exited it the CPU reading was 3-5%.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2009 at 16:45 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>At the moment, I do not sleep well, but that has entirely different reasons. :-)<br><br>Mark:<br><br>You're right, Derek is open about what you're getting (if a little heavy on the buzz). I also like that you get free updates - unlike some other software I know which makes you pay again every time they decide to bump the version number up. I didn't want to sound too negative about it, as I said it is a nice little tool. Perhaps I'll use it again after some improvements were made. Until then I'll stick with my old combination of Timeleft for time boxing and Allnetic for time tracking.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2009 at 21:16 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark<br><br>Have a look at Windows Task Manager | Processes tab and you'll see the memory usage stats.

I appreciate it.<br><br>It seems there are several questions/comments about the product and the 'Genius Mechanism' videos, so let me address those.<br><br>1. The Action Machine and resources - On my test machines, TAM uses very little resources, virtually 0 most of the time. I'm not sure why resources are being used to the extent some of you mention. I will say that TAM will use a lot less resources when minimized, as opposed to simply hidden behind another window. Please try that approach.<br><br>2. The interface isn't customizable - I'm a one-man business. As such, my time is limited, so I have to choose my battles. Adding interface customization to an application is one of the most time-consuming tasks in developing an app. Instead of spending too much time on interface customization, which I received 3 requests for over the last 2 months, I spent my time on adding things that I received a barrage of requests for. I wish I could duplicate myself. :)<br><br>3. No trial version - Once again, as a one-man business, supporting a trial version and dealing with people who want to hack it to get the app for free just isn't an option. I offer a 8-week no questions-asked guarantee to allow time for people to use it to the fullest. If they're not happy with it, I seriously don't ask questions when they request a refund.<br><br>4. Why not give it away for free? - When it comes to productivity, TAM is all I have to offer. There aren't any backend seminars, workshops or coaching I offer that would pay the bills otherwise. I'm still waiting to get adopted by Oprah, but until then, I have to charge for the software. :)<br><br>5. What's up with the 'Genius Mechanism' videos? - I felt, and still feel the videos offered a LOT of value! How many people would have watched them if I had said, 'look at these mind map videos'? Probably next to none! The system for collecting knowledge that I shared in the videos has helped me immensely over the years, and anyone who watched them and actually uses the strategy I laid out will see a dramatic increase in retention and understanding of the topics they choose to learn. True, if you're an avid mind mapper already, chances are you didn't learn anything new, but I'm pretty convinced that to 95% of the population out there, this was something new and valuable. I chose the name to convey an end-benefit to the viewer AND to pique their curiosity enough them to view it. The video doesn't do anyone any good if you can't drive them to at least click the Play button. Know what I mean?<br><br>That's it for now. :)<br><br>I'll check back here occasionally to answer any other questions anyone might have.<br><br>Once again, thanks for sharing your input about my little productivity app.<br><br>Have a great day!<br><br>Derek</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2009 at 15:34 | Derek Franklin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>little b:<br><br>I wrote a small timer application for you that does tick every second.

This was worth the risk.<br><br>As for the Genius Mechanism - I really liked watching the videos.  As someone who hasn't used mind-mapping for about 8 years, it was great to have the reminder of this great tool and I have started using it.  The genius about it was that it was simple.<br><br>My husband used the word "organogram" yesterday - a word I haven't heard for years, perhaps I have just been out of the corporate world for too long - bringing up the family and working a network marketing business from home!! :-)<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 June 2009 at 21:41 | Stephanie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There is a free online version of The Action Machine available here for anybody who might want to try it out.

Firstly, the link you gave lead to another link which is an almost identical product with a different name for $20 less than The Action Machine.  That leads me to wonder if it is indeed the same program.  It seems to have embedded advertising in it.  I wonder if that is what makes it cheaper.<br><br>There is also the question of versions.  I've seen 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 for Action Machine.  I wonder what version Action Enforcer is.<br><br>The final observation is that this might be really great for a person who worked on the computer all day, but looking at his own list ... he has "Clean Garage" and such ... how does it work when you are out in the garage while your computer is in your office counting down and ringing an alarm.<br><br>I know the concept works.  I use it with countdown timers on my watch.  I'm also concerned that neither of these sites has a demo version available.  The best you get is video and a promise that it is really cool.  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 July 2010 at 9:47 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Joshua, THANKS so much for posting this link to the on-line version! I have really wanted to try a "trial version" (not a money-back guarantee version, which IS different) and so I really appreciate this. I used it yesterday to good effect (found it motivating to see in such a visual way, how my day was shaping up and really like being able to generate reports). I will see how it goes this week, but I think I might purchase it, as I did find it helpful (and didn't realize one could have different saved "sets" of tasks/timers, say for weekends, which is great.) <br><br>Mike, re the link to the almost identical product: I notice that the developer's name ( Derek Franklin) is the same, so I am guessing it is just a "private branding" of his original Action Machine, but perhaps as you surmise, an older version, as it doesn't seem to have a Mac option available? (which might also explain the less expensive price? Also, the "almost identical version" doesn't have the "free bonuses" nor the offer for the "free updates")</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 August 2010 at 15:17 | Bev</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bev,<br><br>Thanks for your observations.  I did not realize that there was a trial on that site.  I too will only buy a product if I can try it first.  In looking at the other products that Derek sells, I notice that he has a marketing gimmick whereby if you buy some of his products he gives you re-marketing rights for free.  So someone might have done that with this product, gotten the rights and is now selling it for 1/2 price.  That would explain the lack of "free updates".<br><br>While I like the overall look of the thing, and it's nice feature of being able to save task lists, I can't get past the problem of it having to run on a computer (rather than an iPhone).  If you are going to be using it for everything, then it really needs to be "in your pocket" or the whole idea just won't work.  I previously implemented the same idea in Toodledo and PI on my iphone.  I had my tasks in Toodledo, I accessed them through PI, I would schedule them in PI for slots during the day based on estimated duration, then alarm them.  Not as slick as this, but at least it was in my pocket where I needed it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2010 at 11:40 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bev, you are welcome.  I was happy to find it as well, because I, too, dislike paying upfront for something I have had no chance to try first.  If I know something will help me, I gladly pay for it, but if it won't, I don't.<br><br>Derek seems to have sold different types of reseller rights, so "The Action Machine" is out there in a few variations, this being one of them.  As far as I can tell, it's really the same.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2010 at 20:14 | Joshua</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Joshua, it's been really an interesting "trial" for me! Thanks again. I have used countless "systems" on my computer, on my iPod touch, paper systems, etc, and maybe it is the usual "new and fun" aspect, but I REALLY LIKE many of the features on this, especially as I said, being able to see my day visually, (hahaha, LOVE those big green checkmarks!) and I really like the idea of being able to keep task/action lists on different themes (daily tasks, weekly tasks, occasional tasks on no set schedule) *as well as* then to be able to create "timer groups" from them (say, for different days of the week) and the ease of adding tasks/timers on the fly, as I plan my day. While I have also used various systems over the years  for "reports" I also like how the reports are done, here. I've noticed that the on-line version doesn't save everything I've added (could be a timing thing, where I've moved off the page too fast), so I might get the "money-back guarantee" version to finish my 'testing', but so far, so great!  :o)  (I just hope it's not the "honeymoon" period and that this works for me, over a longer period of time than my usual honeymoons!) <br><br>MIKE: I couldn't quite understand at first, when you said all you could see was a black screen, but I guess you were looking at it from your iPhone? The Action Machine is flash-based, so that would explain it !! I know what you mean about wanting whatever system you use 'in your pocket' ... I can't IMAGINE that Derek the developer, hasn't been asked for an iPhone /iPad version yet (so I wonder if one is in the works), and sync-able would be all the better. While it was developed in Adobe's Flash (which is not supported on the iPhone) and so obviously would have to be rebuilt, surely SOMEONE in the apps community would be happy to license the idea and to rebuild it as an app?? I haven't come across anything else really like it, in the app store (not that I've looked exhaustively.) I would be very surprised if some version didn't show up as an app!! In the meantime, the desktop version will likely suffice for me, for now. (For tasks like "clean the garage" where I am somewhere else, I just set the timer and then stop it when I come back, but it's a clunky workaround ... however it does get stuff I want on the "reports" at the end of the day.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 August 2010 at 19:10 | Bev</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Bev,<br><br>I have no clue why I got a black screen.  I changed browsers and after a LONG time loading I got the online version.  Who knows?<br><br>I'm sure he will not do an iphone version.  I looked at his YouTube video about how he developed this thing and he used a program generator of some kind.  Perhaps Flash?  Surely there is no development path to the iPhone.  It would have to be done from scratch and probably rethought as well.  The iPhone screen is too small to allow the same kind of display.<br><br>I'm glad it works for you.  It might work for me too if I were tied to the computer and not roving around.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 August 2010 at 1:06 | Mike</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
