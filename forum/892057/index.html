I would be interested in any tips or advice you would like to share.<br><br>I'm returning to the same company, but not necessarily to the same projects. I work in a consultancy so there is always more work then time  plus I tend to work on several projects at the same time and in a variety of roles from consultant to project manager.<br><br>Before I left work I was using a system combining aspects from Do it tomorrow, Get everything done and Getting things done (if you are interested I described it on my blog <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.darktea.co.uk/blog/how-i-successfully-plan-my-day).">http://www.darktea.co.uk/blog/how-i-successfully-plan-my-day).</a> The system was successful, but high maintenance.<br><br>As my working hours are going to be defined by the nursery drop off and pick up times I want a simple system that doesn't take a long time to get started in the morning. AutoFocus seems to fit this requirement and I'm currently having success with AF4 at home getting a good balance of new and older tasks completed.<br><br>So, if all your current tasks and commitments for your job were removed and you were starting completely from scratch what would you do?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 September 2009 at 14:32 | Kate Davis</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Kate<br><br>I have not been starting from scratch, but I think it doesn't make any big difference as long as you don't dump your mind in the system all at once. But in your situation you shouldn't have any backlog at all.<br><br>As I can work from several locations, it makes sense to me to have only one single list, and I would suggest everybody to try it. At the end, as somebody else said on this forum, "my life is one".<br><br>In my case I follow several private and professional projects, have to arrange my time according to the work of my wife, the school of our child, the requests of my colleagues and my customers, and of course my desires. What I really appreciate of AF are the simplicity and light weight and these are for me winning factors in this context.<br><br>All my tasks go on the list, and recently I have stopped using a reminder tool, and started entering on the list also those items that will be done in some future date. Till now also this is working; having them under my eyes gives me the opportunity to catch new ideas, and at the end to better plan my time.<br><br>Enjoy your return to work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 September 2009 at 15:24 | Jiru</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Crikey, just looked at your blog and that is a very complicated system.  By the time you've calculated how long all your tasks are going to take you, you could have done 10 tasks.  Must admit, I have a pretty pivotal job with a high workload so I just have to crash through things as fast as I can.<br><br>I use my own version of Do It Tomorrow but I very rarely write things down.  In terms of meetings and travel I use my calendar a lot.  As soon as I get a sniff of a meeting I enter it into my calendar.  I make a note of what I need in the subject line or what I am waiting on and from who and use traffic lights so I can see straight away where I am up to (i.e. green is confirmed, yellow is pending and I am waiting on info, red is action and I need to do something!).  i also add travel into my calendar so I know if I need to book tickets or arrange a lift, etc. <br><br>In terms of the daily routine thing, I do that too but I email those tasks to myself (i.e. check calendar, clear email, etc.).  My email folders are set up as tickler folders (i.e. 17 Thu, 18 Fri, 21 Mon, etc.).  Once I've done the daily task I drag it tomorrow's folder or if it's something I need to do again later in the day I will put it in my PM folder.<br><br>In the same way, when I ask someone to do something in an email, I blind copy it to myself, work out when I need an answer by then drag it to that folder.  I normally give people a couple of days, sometimes a week and every now and again same day or next day.  <br><br>Each morning I clear my email then clear my email folder for that particular day.  It's pretty easy to remember if I've received a reply and if not, I chase the response by forwarding the email.<br><br>Hope that makes sense!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 September 2009 at 0:12 | Doris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Doris, <br><br>There was a previous post with a discussion of using [w] in emails to automatically send them to a waiting for folder.  Mark seemed to like it as well.<br><br>Kate, I have to agree with Doris in that the system you previously used seemed complicated.  I would start with something simpler and see how little you can get away with.  Time management has a point of diminishing returns.  Every minute spent organizing is a minute not spent doing,so there has to be a return.  Good luck with return to the working world, it has changed in the last year due to the economy.<br><br>Gerry<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 September 2009 at 3:58 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry:<br><br>That's right. You can put a simple code into any email that you need a reply to, and then write a rule that copies that email into a special "Awaiting Reply" folder and also notifies you when the reply is received. It works brilliantly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 September 2009 at 13:06 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'd advise you to take it easy if possible and be realistic about what you can get done - allow yourself time to get used to being in a work situation again. Good luck!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 September 2009 at 15:36 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Gerry. Your statement, "I would start with something simpler and see how little you can get away with", reminds me of something I read just this morning:<br><br>Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 September 2009 at 20:11 | Zane</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jiro,<br><br>You are right I am starting completely from scratch because I handed over all my projects before I left. This is why I'd like to get a good system ready before I return so I make the most of the situation. My only backlog will be the few tasks I've picked up from reading the company newsletter such as learn the new IT system.<br><br>When I first implemented GTD I considered having a combined list (obviously split by context), however my work and home lives are separated by location and I'm not keen for them to merge. I do not want to be reminded of work tasks I haven't done during the weekend.<br><br>I also like the simplicity of AutoFocus and think it is the technique for me to take back to work with me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2009 at 21:29 | Kate Davis</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Doris and Gerry,<br><br>Yes you are absolutely correct, my previous system was complicated which is why I don't want to use it again when I return to work. <br><br>There were a lot of benefits to the system such as identifying a realistic amount of work to be done in the day; it always felt great when I got more done than my list! It also helped me realise how long some tasks took; e.g. estimating for 1 hour and they would actually take closer to 5. It also helped me notice interruptions during the day.<br><br>However, most of the set up each day was done in my own time, and I'm not willing to do that in future because I would rather spend it with my daughter. Hence my desire for something simpler, even though this system worked for me.<br><br>Doris, I'm particularly interested in your use of emails and calendar. After many attempts of using my companies software I realised paper was significantly better. However they are just about to move to Outlook. I've been to a presentation about it today and it looks impressive. I've been following a thread in the forum about Outlook <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/887429">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/887429</a> and think it is something I need to look in to further.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2009 at 21:57 | Kate Davis</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Kate,<br><br>Outlook is indeed a powerful and flexible tool. There is no practical limit to the amount of time you can spend tuning your configuration. So you need to be disciplined. <br><br>I have tried a lot of approaches and my top eight tips would be:<br><br>1. Pick a configuration, allow yourself to tweak it for the first couple of days and then stick with it for a couple of weeks. After that, decide whether it works for you.<br><br>2. Keep it as simple as possible. Use a paper system as a template. If you're using AF, don't date your tasks or set priorities. <br><br>3. Use the task list for tasks (!).<br><br>4. If you have a lot of mail to deal with, clear it in batches. move any mail that will take more than a couple of minutes to the task list (drag and drop). and use search folders for critical incoming mails and sent mails flagged for follow up.<br><br>5. If you're using the latest version of Autofocus (which is almost zero set-up and maintenance and works well for me), you will need separate lists for projects and routines. Decide where you are going to keep them. (Separate Tasks folders or One Note are popular choices)<br><br>6. Despite what I said about keeping it simple, check out the task views. I like to view my tasks filtered for open tasks only.<br><br>7. Make sure you keep a paper copy with you when you are away from the machine. Or at least something to note down new ideas and actions. (A piece of blank A4 folded down to A7 works for me. I do write quite small, though.)<br><br>8. If you are lucky enough to have a laptop and a separate screen at work, use an extended desktop across both. Try to be consistent about where your admin (Mail/Calendar/tasks) shows and where your work (documents, plans, presentations) goes. But don't get obsessive.<br><br>To illustrate what I'm talking about, there's an annotated screenshot of my setup here: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://screencast.com/t/EHFXFukWLc">http://screencast.com/t/EHFXFukWLc</a><br><br>It's not perfect, but has been working well for me for a couple of weeks (so I'm allowing myself a tiny tweakette). It is Outlook 2007. I had something similar with Outlook 2003.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br><br>Will</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 September 2009 at 8:46 | Will</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
