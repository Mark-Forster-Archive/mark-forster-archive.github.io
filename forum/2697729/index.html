Here is how it usually happens:<br>- I scan through some tasks.<br>- I notice Task B, but it does not "stand out" because it's really waiting for Task A to be completed first<br>- One or two tasks further down the list, I run across Task A, which does stand out. So I work on Task A, and get it done. <br>- Since I had just seen Task B, and it feels like an easy thing to get done now, my natural inclination is just to get it done now.<br>- But this creates a sense of conflict, since the rules "don't allow" moving back on the page, etc.<br><br>I'm trying to find the best way to resolve that feeling of conflict. <br><br>Cycling through the page till nothing stands out seems to be a way to resolve this. Of course, this doesn't cover the case where Task B appears at the end of one page, and Task A appears near the top of the next page. But there's something about turning the page that "erases" the first page's tasks from my mind, and allows me to focus attention on the new page. Maybe that's why I don't remember running into this edge case before. It usually seems to happen when the two tasks are on the same page, but they appear out of sequence for some reason.<br><br>There are all kinds of workarounds -- many ways to "allow" myself to work on Task B right now. I could pretend I am cycling forward through all the tasks on the list and arriving at Task B (but that isn't in fact what I'd be doing). I could also just write Task B at the end of the list, and scan quickly forward till I land on it (but that would be added work). I could invoke your common override rule, "If a task needs to be done now, just do it now!". But the intention of that override always seemed to be for handling emergencies and urgent things, rather than more mundane things like task sequencing and readiness.<br><br>And so none of these workarounds resolve that feeling of conflict. The workarounds seem to be giving me a back-door to my occasional impulsiveness to override the core psychology of the Simple Scanning process. Following impulse isn't the same thing as allowing something to stand out. I always feel a sense of discord when I break away from the rules even for small things like this -- and that discord plays havoc with the standing-out process. The more I use workarounds like this, the less I find myself able to trust the standing-out process.<br><br>Maybe I am making too much of this... but I'd welcome any insights you have. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2017 at 19:34 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Caibre65 and I have been using what he calls "Day-based FAF".<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/12/15/addition-to-simple-scanning-rules.html#item21810906">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/12/15/addition-to-simple-scanning-rules.html#item21810906</a><br><br>It has cured the same dilemma I had about Simple Scanning's sequential process, since being "trapped" in a day lets me go back to items I just passed without going back to the beginning of the whole list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2017 at 19:47 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Maybe I am making too much of this... but I'd welcome any insights you have. :-) &gt;&gt;<br><br>Something similar happened to me this morning.

No problem. When I'm working on a task, I not only work on that task, but everything that I need to do to get that task done. Consider a task to be the boundaries of what you should be doing. <br><br>So in this example, I feel fine writing my shopping list because it will help me to drive to the store and buy groceries. I also feel fine crossing out the earlier task, and even rewriting it if need be; because this all falls under the umbrella of "driving to the store and buying groceries."<br><br>In other other words: if I "break" (consider those quotation marks huge and in bold) the rules of the system to get a task done, I don't actually consider the rules rules broken. I have some tasks on my list which introduce new rules and even talk about trying new systems.

Then I keep cycling through the list (once I get to the end I start at the beginning) until I get back to task "b" which is now ready to be done. If there are some tasks in between "a" and "b" that get done so be it (no pun intended). No rules broken, all tasks get done when they get done. <br>My advice, just go with your intuition in selecting tasks. Don't worry about assigning a priority or value to a task, just pick one.

As an iNtuitive I could not believe the detail the Sensors gave us. It was information overload! Why complicate such an easy task?! And the Sensors gave us iNtuitives a big, fat FAIL for our scant, vague, so-called directions.<br><br>I gained a new appreciation for the way others' brains work and it changed the way I communicated from then on.<br><br>For me tasks pop out, they don't just stand out.

I learned that INTPs supposedly take each new piece of information in and think about it to try to make it fit into a complete system that incorporates everything else you know already.  For example I was listening to a podcast by Jocko Willink and he talks about creating a single todo list, but prioritizing it and then scheduling what you're going to work on, checking the prioritized list maybe twice a day to make sure you're not missing something important. Then when I'm reading this very thread, I'm thinking about how standing out and prioritizing relate to each other, and the ways that FVP deals with the ability to let you add tasks that you want to do before other tasks. For me, it doesn't seem that being INTP simplifies things at all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 December 2017 at 22:35 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm INTJ.

That's because our roads are not ordered on the grid system but have just grown up over the years any old how. <br><br>The Romans were the last people to try to organize our roads. There are many old Roman roads in England which were already nearly a thousand years old when King Harold marched his men the length of the country to repel the Norman invaders in 1066. You can always tell which roads they are because they carry on majestically across hill and dale in a dead straight line. And most of them are still in everyday use.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 December 2017 at 8:41 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Atlanta has a ring-perimeter highway.  The signposts for entries to these highways (ring or not) always indicate which way they're going in NSEW.  I-285N, or I-285S, for instance.  But because it is a ring you can get on the highway and head first north, then east, then south, then west without ever exiting the highway or changing direction.  And the signage changes to match.<br><br>Which leads to knowing that the person you're giving directions to needs to head clockwise on the highway when they reach it, but not being sure if they will be going north or east.  You can't just tell them L/R because sometimes the on ramps are simple and sometimes they're cloverleaf type, so unless you know the intersection, you're never sure which side it's on. Makes folks from out of town a smidgen bewildered.<br><br>This is can't be an Atlanta-only phenomenon, of course, but I had never encountered the problem anywhere until it happened to me. :D</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 December 2017 at 13:58 | R.M. Koske</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I remember living in Belgium for a year (I'm from Canada) and constantly losing my sense of direction because many of the roads were curvy, unlike where I grew up where most of the roads were based on a grid system. In Belgium, I would walk, but unless I was paying very close attention, I would change direction without realizing it and end up completely disoriented. Apparently that's the reason people get lost in the woods without a compass, we have a natural tendency to walk in circles.

State highways in Georgia tend to be quite meandering and sometimes hard to follow because they might turn corners at intersections if the roads don't continue the right direction.  (In other words, highway 41 goes North/South, but Cobb Parkway starts curving west, so 41 and Cobb Parkway diverge.  Or Houston Lake road stops, but 41 jogs over a block and continues on another road.)  Are your rings like that?
