I have 7 active pages and have dismissed 10, all of 35 items. I have started several new projects and revived some moribund ones, in one case after a gap of twenty years. Kudos to Mark for putting together this method.<br><br>Outside the Studio the picture is less clear. My Office list has 11 active pages and 13 inactive. I struggle to visit every page daily. The situation with my Home list is stretched still more, with 26 active pages and only 1 dismissed. As such, recently added tasks are getting neglected, which were formally handled by DIT.<br><br>I am thus thinking of taking a leaf from Mel's and Charles' book and starting each day at the end of the list and then continuing from where I left off the previous day. But I would tweak that idea by going to the penultimate page rather than the final, and "touching" the final two pages before reverting to the previous day's bookmark. This would be to handle the situation where there are very few items on the final page.<br><br>I prefer not to change systems, although the above represents a simple additional rule. Systems can sometimes work like a Procrustean bed, on which users had to be adjusted lengthwise rather than the bed, I'll try to make AF1 work for a bit longer before switching. Either way, after 3 months use, I conclude that AF is an important step forward.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2009 at 15:04 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi,<br><br>If a date 'separator' is added eg:<br><br>----------------------- Tues 14/4<br><br>into the list each day, it would be pretty easy to start from the beginning of yesterday.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2009 at 17:43 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>What is the normal operation of AF when the amount of time available for doing is less than the amount of time needed, and you keep on adding items?<br>Answer - the number of pages will increase and when you reach a certain point you will hit each page, even the new one, relatively infrequently.<br><br>Solutions:-<br>1. Keep the pages and items moving; even so far as possibly only doing 1 item a page and that for 5 minutes (when it then goes on the last page). This brings the last page around sooner, but also mixes older items with newer ones as the ones that have been worked on are written on the last page.<br>2. When you realise that the amount of time needed exceeds that available, keep your eye open for items that stand out for being too low a priority to get done, and dismiss them.<br>I'm sure there are many others.<br><br>The only reason why you should be anxious about not doing recently input items that fast is if the issue is urgency (probably needs to be tackled another way) or if recent items are genuinely more important (in which case many of the older items really need to be dismissed).<br><br>Focussing on the recent will always feel better (we tend to think that what is in our minds now is more important) - but after a gap do they still feel that they were that important? Frequently not.<br><br>Done (mostly) according to the instructions, AF is pretty much a self-regulating system. The more it is tweaked, the less it has the capacity to self-regulate. If operating it is leading to stress, it should best be viewed as a call to reflect and refine our 'intuitive' decision making rather than a need to tweak the system. Of course, our individual circumstances may mean that some tweaks will suit us best but I do agree with Mark about the system 'as is' functioning better than any changes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2009 at 22:46 | Dm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Dm: "possibly only doing 1 item a page and that for 5 minutes (when it then goes on the last page)"<br><br>If you do the math, at this rate, it will take at least 2 hours to cycle through a 26 page list, and probably longer. If, as must often be the case, a person has less time available some evenings, or e.g. has an appointment, some last Page items will be reached every few days. And less frequently than that if more than 5 minutes be taken.<br><br>"Little and often" is good, "little and infrequently" is not necesarily so.<br><br>The tweak fixes that. It also brings back, essentially, the benefits of the Current Initiative, a useful concept from DIT which was not incorporated into AF.<br><br>Anyone trying this might find it helpful, for Home items, to revert to the penultimate page in the evening, rather than the morning. so that some items can be processed the same day..This trick also works for DIT.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 April 2009 at 6:06 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Laurence:<br><br>If your tweak works for you then don't let me argue you out of it!<br><br>However I agree with Dm. The system is basically self-regulating. If you don't have time to do the amount of work that you have, then AF will sort that out for you if you let it. The trouble with tweaks like yours is that they prevent the system from adjusting.<br><br>If you have a 26 page list, you can move nearly instantaneously from the beginning to the end simply by dismissing all the items in between. I'm not saying that would be desirable or necessary, but if you don't have time to do all the items then dismissing items is the way the system sorts this out for you. Anything which gets in the way of its doing this is going to leave you with the problem of having too much work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 April 2009 at 8:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I know everyone panics about the number of active pages, and I did too, particluarly around the 15 to 25 page point, but now the number of active pages is really really not a problem.  Working in the normal course I am always working towards the end or near the end so am rarely a vast way from the end, and when I do return to the beginning I zip through the first pages anyway, as some will always be ready to be dismissed. I know now that each time I cycle through I will probably dismiss at least three pages and close by completing several more.<br><br>Ironically the number of pages is actually encouraging me to add more items rather than less.  I am getting stuff done!  If a task needs doing it should be on my list.  My list is my control system.  If it is not on the list it is unlikely to get done.  Obviously I am not going through my home/office picking up every item that needs action and adding it into my list, but I do add every project I think of, and then, when a project stands out, IF it is the right time to deal with it more intensively then everything related gets added.  No way would I have done this when starting AF - it would have sent me screaming for the hills!!! - but now........ I add more into AF rather than less - and the system genuinely DOES sort it all out. <br><br>Just off to review and post my latest stats :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 April 2009 at 10:15 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>"If you have a 26 page list, you can move nearly instantaneously from the beginning to the end simply by dismissing all the items in between."<br><br>This reminds me of declaring a backlog in DIT. Another way of looking at the tweak, using the Dm calculation, is that for a minimum of 10 minutes a day, one can relieve the anxiety of missing something important recently added. The rest of the day can be AF exactly as you have defined it. I am not saying it would work out that way though, and that is where one or two end-of-list projects might be attended to daily in a Current Initiative manner.<br><br>A brave suggestion, and I believe some here have done it, essentially, by starting afresh.<br><br>Christine: Yes a large number of pages can be daunting, but in your case it seems to me the issue is less so because you have email (and coffee - as you can see I have been paying attention) at the top of each page. Is this not effectively an additional index card for routines, which is incorprated to AF with every page turn? Myy tweak affects the flow once a day before reverting to vanilla AF.<br><br>Several people here have come up with different ways of handling routine items, whether it be index cards, time-blocking or multiple entries. I have tried to find something with minimal extra procedures outside the normal rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 April 2009 at 13:18 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>"If you have a 26 page list, you can move nearly instantaneously from the beginning to the end simply by dismissing all the items in between.. . . but if you don't have time to do all the items then dismissing items is the way the system sorts this out for you."<br><br>A weakness of my tweak is that the final two Pages may become The List. Can you confirm that you saying that for AF proper to work. then the list needs to be kept at such a length that it can be worked through daily (or almost daily) by dismissing (if need be, ruthlessly), in the absence of an index card etc?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 April 2009 at 6:50 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>Also can you clarify what mechanisms you would employ to ensure important tasks would not slip through the cracks, after such a large scale dismissing?<br><br>Thanks as ever for your time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 April 2009 at 6:54 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Laurence:<br><br>No, I am saying that you need to follow the rules and let the list become whatever length it wants to be. What I said about dismissing was just to show that your intuition can move very fast if it needs to. If the list is run according to the rules, I wouldn't expect that situation to actually arise.<br><br>As for keeping track of dismissed items, I recommend putting a recurring task "Review dismissed items" on your list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 April 2009 at 9:04 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Laurence<br><br>My "every page" tasks started accidentally in that when I changed from a 34 line notebook to a 38 page lined book I needed 4 items to "fill the gap" to maintain page structure. I wanted to rewrite the pages as the reason for the change was that the pages kept falling out of my original book :-)<br><br>Personally I don't see that as breaking the rules - I have no problem with adding an item twice to maintain flow, in the same way that I would not check back to see if a task I think of has been added previously.  If something is duplicated it just gets crossed out when reached. I take your point about the likeness to an index card but it is not really the same in that there is no "requirement" to action it/them every day but still only when/if they stand out.  The key to AF is the standing out - I can add anything on to my lists, but even if I add an item 20 times, if it does not stand out then it still gets dismissed (20 times!). With an index card of "must do" items that would not be the case.<br><br>You are absolutely right about the final pages becoming "the list".  That is a real danger with that approach.  When I have have dumped a whole project batch of tasks into my list and worked on them as a batch of pages - as an emergency measure - it has been clear to see the temptation to work on current items.  However it is important to remember that one of the strengths of AF is not just the doing of tasks but the fact that it filters those tasks.  One of the ways it does that is by putting space between the task entry and the task action, so by not moving from that last page you are losing that benefit. <br><br>I really find that the benefit of any sort of index card approach, whether it be an actual index card, or a MindMap, is not in the card/map itself, and certainly not in the actioning of tasks from that extracted list, but in the writing and identification of the tasks you put on that lists.  All it is is a safety net.  Our intuition knows what the important things are, our rational mind is not convinced of that fact.  By pacifying our rational mind with a list, we are effectively reassuring it that we have given our intuition a reminder so it does not forget.  And guess what - it doesn't!<br><br>The answer to everything is 42, er no sorry I meant, "TRUST THE SYSTEM" :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 April 2009 at 11:49 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine:<br><br>Do you ever action one of the initial four things on a page, and then move on to the next page? (Ordinarily such a page would be dismissed if none of the other items stand out.)<br><br>I'm also interested if and how you think productivity would be impaired if you stopped adding the four items to the top of new pages.<br><br>As you have everything working well I wouldn't suggest actually changing procedures!<br><br>In terms of trusting the system, we need to be able to do so if it is going to work for us. If we don't trust it, we will be nervous about adding tasks to it. Although the beta testing is over, I feel this period where all the exceptional people on the forum are feeding back to each other is a kind of alpha testing, from which we all benefit.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 April 2009 at 13:35 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Laurence<br><br>&lt;&lt;Do you ever action one of the initial four things on a page, and then move on to the next page? (Ordinarily such a page would be dismissed if none of the other items stand out.)&gt;&gt;<br><br>The answer to that is yes.  I treat them as any other items and would dismiss them if they and nothing else stood out.  In practice though such an eventuality (although I have to say it does not often occur) does have a real use in that somehow it primes my subconscious to know that on the next pass I MUST do or dismiss. They can therefore give a breathing space.<br><br>&lt;&lt;I'm also interested if and how you think productivity would be impaired if you stopped adding the four items to the top of new pages.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Strangely this thread had already made me ask that question myself :-)  I realised early on in my use of AF that my situation was somewhat different to that of a number of posters on this forum, as a large part of my "work" is backlog oriented and that of necessity has a major impact, as does my erratic discretionery time.  I believe that this usage of AF may well change once the backlog issues are resolved.  The conclusion I have come to is that the spacing of those tasks is right at this point in time, in that it handles the effect of being unable to cycle through all of the pages daily. There is a need to have a more frequent "check email" task and "check schedule" task - this solution keeps it within AF.<br><br>My feeling is that, if they weren't available on list, then by necessity I would have to "just do them" which would not be my preference. I should point out that they don't always stand out - they are not a "must do" task!  When I finally clear my backlogs I will keep you posted as to what happens to those items! <br><br>Although I have always believed I have been trusting the system, I realise that I am actually learning to trust it more and more.  The fact that I now know I can dump several hundred items into it - and that the system WILL handle that - is not something I would have considered trying at the beginning.  Neither would I have been so relaxed about whatever number of pages AF expands to!  I mean let's face it, if we really have hundreds of things to do then we have hundreds of things to do whether they are in our lists or not.  If they are in our lists they are managed.  They may be dismissed but they are still recorded and able to be actioned at a future time if we wish. If we limit what we put into our lists who are we fooling - ourselves? - probably not even ourselves as there will always be those little niggling black clouds ..........:-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 April 2009 at 14:05 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Mark<br><br>I've been using AF as writ today, but dismissing more liberally than before (though not *all* the pages!!), and hopefully this will help.<br><br>@Christine<br><br>If I feel the need to tweak AF again, it will probably be to emulate your technique - very fortuitous you had those extra lines in the newer notebook.<br><br>Thanks all for your helpful comments.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 April 2009 at 19:26 | Laurence</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
