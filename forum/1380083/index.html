I picked 25 as the number of flags to use for my initial closed list each day. I think in the beginning that number pretty much fit with the backlog of work I had.<br><br>I think I may try fewer flags, meaning that I will get to working my list in orthodox AF1 style more quickly. I think I'm going to try 15-20 flags. That's enough to cover the urgent things that need to be done with a few leftover for those tasks that cannot be completed with a single effort.<br><br>It may wind up not making any difference, because the first 5 tasks I do after I have completed the closed list of Flagged Tasks may wind up being the same ones I would have flagged. So, this is going to be an interesting experiment.<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2011 at 2:34 | 2mc</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Do you actually need a set number? Can't you just flag up whatever number of tasks stand out on your pass through the list?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2011 at 8:23 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;Can't you just flag up whatever number of tasks stand out on your pass through the list?&lt;<br><br>Absolutely.<br><br>When I first started, I did that. I had my little Post-It Notes case and when I needed a flag I pulled it out. When I pulled the Flags off in the beginning, I said, "What do I do with these?" In the beginning, I threw them away. But, then I realized that was wasting money. So, I would take them off and put them on the inside cover.<br><br>After a few iterations, I realized I had 25. So, I put away the Post-It Notes case and just used the 25 on the inside cover. <br><br>I almost always flagged 25. There were times I wished I could flag more, but I knew that since I started from the newest tasks to the oldest that I had the urgent covered and as soon as the flags were gone I could go to work on those that stood out but I didn't have flags for.<br><br>I really kind of backed into it. So, I thought, as an experiment, to see how my intuition worked with less flags and how that might affect my productivity.<br><br>I don't know if it will do anything. <br><br>The great thing about the flags is that I have a closed list of items that stand out as opposed to a closed list of a mixture. <br><br>And, the effect on my psyche of pulling the flags off is awesome.<br><br>I'll report how it goes.<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2011 at 23:36 | 2mc</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I actually do the "intuitive flagging" where some days I will have 10 - 15 while others I will only have 4.  it also depends on what I know is on my plate for the day.  <br><br>If I'm going to be in meetings all day and on the go then I know (from trial and error) there is no way I will be able to get those 15 done.  So, I reduce it down. IF I get those 4 or 5 done then it's a victory and I just go back to the AF list as usual.  The next day I might be able to get much more done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2011 at 19:51 | BryanR</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bryan,<br><br>&gt;I actually do the "intuitive flagging" where some days I will have 10 - 15 while others I will only have 4. it also depends on what I know is on my plate for the day. &lt;<br><br>That certainly makes a lot of sense. Thanks for sharing how it works in your life.<br><br>Do you find flagging helps you? Do you use it with AF1 or some other flavor?<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2011 at 20:49 | 2mc</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm considering using flags for a maximum of 3 items / day. (Well, at least until I hear about Marks new system at least!)<br><br>My use of flagging would be for allowing myself 'access all areas' - at any time in the day - to the 3 flagged items within AF1 and therefore not working to the AF1 rules solely for the 3 items. <br><br>I wouldn't expect myself to cycle soley through the flagged items or to do the 3 of them first before doing anything else, just purely to provide flexible access to the items when I need it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2011 at 21:47 | leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I personally don't see the benefit of a large number of flags.  It would seem to go contrary to the purpose of flagging something.  I would think you would flag a few urgent items to stay focused on them.  With 25 flagged it just seems like a list of 25 things to do, but with the issue of having to flip through the flags to get to them.  A sheet of paper has 30 lines would it not be better to just work a closed list of the top 25 things you need to do and incubate the others in a notebook or on another list.  Just curious as to how the flags benefit you.<br><br>Thanks</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2011 at 23:01 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Gerry!<br><br>&gt;With 25 flagged it just seems like a list of 25 things to do&lt;<br><br>Isn't that what our To Do lists are? Even your Triple Tasks system contains a list of To Do tasks mingled among your notes. (Your system is pretty neat and I've been meaning to write a post of how one could use flags with your system.)<br><br>&gt;with the issue of having to flip through the flags to get to them&lt;<br><br>I've heard this comment before and I've never really understood it. It's as if it would be considered a Herculean task to flip through pages. I haven't found it taxing or off-putting in actual practice. I think this is more a complaint of speculation than it is a complaint of actual practice. It's not burdensome at all.<br><br>&gt;A sheet of paper has 30 lines would it not be better to just work a closed list of the top 25 things you need to do and incubate the others in a notebook or on another list.&lt;<br><br>That requires rewriting. And, I do find rewriting burdensome. My hand will cramp after writing by hand too long. Flags enable me to keep from rewriting.<br><br>And a sheet of paper with 25-30 lines is a closed list. Flags are just a closed list of things that stand out. So, they are similar.<br><br>I think people misunderstand what tasks are on my list. I have routine, recurring items that are flagged. These things usually don't take long. I also have unfinished tasks, so I do some work on them to move them along. I have some urgent, but simple, things to do that have cropped up. And, finally I have some big, important tasks. It's not like the 25 flags are all big, important things.<br><br>I think a lot of people have objections from speculation. These speculations would be answered in the process of actually trying it out for a period of time. It's like Mark said in a post a few days ago, that people didn't try his system for several weeks, as he requested they do, before they started tweaking. And, almost universally the tweaking tended toward more complexity.<br><br>A lot of this cuts against the grain, so to speak. It's against "commonsense." But, it works.<br><br>I'm finding that using 15 flags still identifies the important, pressing, urgent tasks, but it gets me back to orthodox AF1 more quickly. I don't think I'm seeing any difference than that right now. I don't think I'm being more productive or less productive. <br><br>&gt;Just curious as to how the flags benefit you.&lt;<br><br>I've explained this several times. I may be the only one whose brain is like this, but here's what happens. If I'm using AF1 and I'm on a page, my brain nags me with the thought that there MIGHT be something on another page that needs to be done more than the task I'm doing on this page. And, I can't get off of this page, because stuff keeps standing out as I keep paring down the tasks. <br><br>By reviewing my ENTIRE UNIVERSE of tasks and flagging those that stand out as tasks I feel good about tackling first thing in the morning, then I completely silence this nagging feeling. For this one thing alone, I won't give up flagging. But, if Mark's new SF has a way of silencing my brain's nagging, I'll give it a shot.<br><br>I could easily use your Triple Tasks system (without the triple task part) and begin to flag tasks that stand out. One of my tasks would be a recurring task to  "digitize notes." This would be where I would take a handwritten note in my notebook and put it in my ideas document or some other appropriate file on my computer. I would then scratch it out in the notebook. Whenever I scratched through all tasks and notes on a page, I would take the page out. (I think the incentive of taking off flags and taking out pages.)<br><br>The flags would replace the need for rewriting the Triple Tasks at the end of the notebook. This system would keep notes and tasks together in one place. I think it would be an interesting system. In fact, all I would need to do to implement it right now would be to write my notes intermingled with my tasks. After I finish my flagging experiment, I may try that.<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2011 at 23:41 | 2mc</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the detailed reply.  In fact using three flags may be an even more effective way of doing TT since it would cut done on writing the TT page.  For me I just have difficulty seeing how 25 items is enough focus, which is why I like TT, but I may try using the flags for TT.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2011 at 0:37 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;For me I just have difficulty seeing how 25 items is enough focus&lt;<br><br>Keep in mind that a lot of these 25 items are quickly done. They are maintenance items, things that have come up - like phone calls I need to make, etc.<br><br>These weigh on my mind, even if I don't know about them....check that.....ESPECIALLY if I don't know about them. So, it affects my focus.<br><br>So, by flagging them I actually increase my focus.<br><br>Why don't you follow Mark's suggestion above and flag as many as stand out? Try that.<br><br>Again, my focus is sabotaged by my brain, if it knows I haven't considered everything on my list. <br><br>So, by flagging everything that stands out, my brain is able to actually focus wholeheartedly.<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2011 at 0:54 | 2mc</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
