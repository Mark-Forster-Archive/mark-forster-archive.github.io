I was using AF4 revised the last 2 months and dividing into New, Unfinished, Recurring.  I used different Moleskine notebooks for each, but found that this was unnecessarily complicated.   So I have this month been keeping everything in one notebook, and creating a monthly, weekly, daily calendar as I go along when I need it, I have daily, weekly, checklists, and projects and projects notes.  The pages grow organically, chronologically.   Recurring became checklists.  I have some trouble determining whether an item is Unfinished or New.  If a new task belongs to a project, which is it?  Perhaps it doesn't matter.  Sometimes the task goes on a project page.  I keep an index in front.  I find keeping everything in one book simplifies.  I can carry it around.  I tried a ring binder with dividers, but gave up after a day - too clumsy.  <br>I have been using computer software for 11 years to manage my time, but this summer am experimenting with paper.  Looking at a computer screen with the bright light and small print is getting hard on my eyes and fatiguing.  Paper is less stressful.  I do have to scan the pages daily, as there is no search or tagging.  <br>I tried AF1 for two months, when it came out, and come back to it off and on.  I can go on that the whole day and never run out of things to do.   I don't find it good for urgent deadlines or time-consuming projects.   I end up not putting enough time into these when the deadline approaches. <br>I also tried Superfocus for a few months.  <br>I seem to do better when I have a list of things that have to be done today or this week, and a list of projects with deadlines, in addition to the rest.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2011 at 21:00 | markhedm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello everyone, been a while I know!<br><br>Mark, I'm really happy to see you up and at it again.<br>Your taking previous concepts and applying them new mechanics is always a wonder to behold.

There are 31 lines to each page.  When I need a calendar for a day, I draw one, using each line as a half hour.  When I need a calendar for a week, I draw one on two pages.  When I need a calendar for a month,  or a checklist for the month, I draw one, one day for each line.  Each one on the next available blank page. <br>When I start planning a project, I start a new page for one on the next blank page.   <br>I write new tasks on a separate page.  When I need to write down what I must do today, and write the llst on a new page.  <br>This means that projects are not together, and new tasks are not together, and checklists are not together, and calendars on not together, on consecutive pages. <br>I number the pages.  I have a table of contents on the first page.  If I want, I put the page number and description on the first page so I can find it. <br>I date each page. The pages will then be in chronological order of when I started each one. <br><br>I thought of using a 3-ring binder, and using dividers to separate each section, but I quickly gave it up after a day of trying it.  Flipping pages in a Moleskine is so much faster than a binder, a binder is more cumbersome to carry around.  There is still flipping of pages even with a binder with dividers.  <br>Checklists save paper.  However, keeping recurring lists and rewriting and crossing off a la AF1 perhaps is more likely to get the task done.  <br>I hope this helps.  Maybe not the perfect system, but it does have the advantage of keeping everything in one book, easy to carry around. I generally work backwards, from last page to front.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 August 2011 at 16:52 | markhedm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>markhedm,<br><br>Your free-form notebook of lists/calendars/notes/plans sounds intriguing. I like the idea of a bound notebook and just creating a new page for whatever you need at the moment, with all the organization in the chronology and table of contents. Not sure it would work for me –&nbsp;I tend to write notes on index cards, engineering pads, email and article printouts, etc. so I need to maintain an Active/Pending stack of paper, which I don't carry around all day like I do with my pocket AF notebook.<br><br>How many pages are in your notebook? How long have you been using this method?  What happens when you run out of pages –&nbsp;do you carry around two notebooks for a while, or transfer what you need into the new one?<br><br>Sorry I have so many questions.
