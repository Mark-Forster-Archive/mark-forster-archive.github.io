With sporadic discretionery time I am not moving through my pages every day and have the same concerns as everyone else that tasks that need to be done will not be reached in time.  Obviously there is the "just do it" rule but I find that I still have resistance to tasks done that way, as if they have somehow cheated me out of doing them "properly"<br><br>My experiment was to take one particular project which was causing me concern and to write every little detail that came to mind into my lists, on the basis that, when I reached the relevant page I could choose from those project items and get my project cleared. It didn't quite happen as hoped.  It was a helpful exercise in that it enabled me to get all of the constituent parts of the project into the my lists and clarified my thoughts a lot better.  When I came to the page when I could choose from the various tasks however, I found that I had a lot more resistance than I would have hoped to as I felt I had to stay on the page until everything related to the project was completed, rather than moving on at the appropriate time.  <br><br>The conclusion I came to was that it would have been better to make that list of tasks as a separate project list, and to create a single task within AF for the project as a whole.  I could have added that project time as a recurring task and probably achieved the result in a much less resisted way, particular as I would have been able to use the little and often approach. Of course I would still have been able to "just do it" if there were still any parts that needed completing.   <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 22:13 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine, that's the way I integrate Project Planning and<br>using the AF lists. For example, I am studying a detailed<br>technical book, so I have a separate record of the<br>list of chapters I want to study. I set deadlines for the<br>various chapters, but on my AF list I just enter the<br>task "Read a chapter of xxxxxxx". I know where to find<br>the project details for more information.<br><br>I use the Natural Planning Method for projects. I wrote an<br>article on how I use Emacs and org-mode software to implement this:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://tinyurl.com/bauscn">http://tinyurl.com/bauscn</a>    <br><br>Charles</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2009 at 0:57 | Charles</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Charles<br><br>Thank you for the link - very interesting article and also the fact that you sometimes add mindmaps also.  Normally I would not just dump all of the steps into AF in one go - I either use the timeblock or a few of the individual items approach. I deliberately did not go just to my project system and include the items from there but rather relisted the steps from memory but it was the dumping everything in one go that I wanted to experiment with and it was that that caused the resistance.  The great thing about experimenting with AF is that you can see quite quickly what works and what doesn't.  Just goes to show, AF does not like being manipulated!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2009 at 6:45 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Charle &amp; Christine,<br><br>This is one o the biggest difficulty i have bee confronted to since i use AF (2weeks) after GTD. Honestly i did found the right answer. i worked on Omnifocs in a GTD way. Since 2 years i conscienciously drop all my items in it by project &amp; contexts but on the rush it was indeed difficult to focus on context such as call ... My project was difficult to finish and i was disapointed not to go to the end,<br><br>When i discovered AF i realised that it could replace the GTD context. But the same problem was still there how finishing my projet ?. I realised to that i have be more productive but was i more efficient ? <br><br>So i found some little tip. 1) i write every thing which happen in my mind and do it in the AF time. 2) I block a time working on projects in the natural project for important projects wich needs it make a mind map or a list of my BIGS ROCS concerning the project. 3) report all my tasks on autofocus and if it begins comolicated i only report a general topic.<br><br>During the day i always keep my project list on my desk and a binder with all my project alphabeticaly classed (except for the business wich is at the very beginning)<br><br>When i work imagin i sudently decide to work on i item. It can be a general topic or a specialised item. If its general i just have a look on my project list and may be my mind map and work as far as i can. If it it not finished i just report it at the end of the list. And if it is not concerned by a project or there is no intrest for me to see my project i just do it. <br><br>The result is that today i find more easy to work on paper than on computer.<br>I am also more focus on what i do and i have realised tha i could easy report my due date on my agenda with no needs to have it in Omnifocus. <br><br>Hope this will help you. <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2009 at 10:04 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>Why not complete or progress a few items that stand out and dismiss the rest?<br><br>This will give your subconscious time to work on the other items while doing other things.<br><br>cheers,<br>Pete.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2009 at 14:09 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jupiter<br><br>Thanks for your post.  I had previously been working well with projects in AF using either the time block or the individual item approach.  My problem came when I decided to experiment with manipulating the system, to in effect force me to work on a particular project, by dumping so many tasks into it in one go that there was very little choice on the one page.  Of course I could have just done the one item and moved on but it was an interesting exercise because AF just told me what I already knew - that I was not motivated to do that project at that time :-)<br><br>I like your idea of having just "project time" as a task.  I do put individual projects as specifics for use with time blocks - eg "project x" or "project y" but not just "projects" and then seeing which one stands out - that is an interesting concept.<br><br>I also like the idea of mindmapping those projects as well;  it is something I have done in the past for projects and am just picking up on again (as per my "experiment 2"). <br><br>A couple of weeks ago I bought a plain paper pad specifically for mindmapping so I can find them!<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2009 at 14:14 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
