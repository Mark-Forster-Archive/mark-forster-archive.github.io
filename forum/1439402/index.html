As it's for personal items only, I felt daily/43 folders was overkill. I went with weekly, then monthly. I realized somewhere in there if items in there are date specific, they are/should be/could be also on my calendar. If they're not date specific, I'm choosing an arbitrary time in the future that they'll re-surface. I'm finding that all those arbitrary things are getting pushed forward each time I encounter them. I'm finding this isn't working for me. <br><br>What is working for me is using OmniFocus as the home for (as Jupiter put it) my non-actionable items. I have a 'dismissed from SF' list/project in there and move items there from my paper book as necessary. (I haven't moved anything back yet.) I'm thinking that since that's working for me, what I really need for those physical items that I want to consider 'sometime in the future' is one (or more, depending on how much stuff I have) holding file with it's contents in OF. Then it's not one more place to look. <br><br>And for date specific things, because I know that most of the stuff in the tickler ISN'T date specific things and I haven't kept up with it religiously, it's not a trusted part of my system. Anything date specific should be on my calendar and again, I just need ONE file to keep any physical, date specific thing in, which are referenced on the calendar. <br><br>Right now my SDMB is in another electronic document. I plan to integrate it into OF if this set up continues to work for me for the next month or two. It's more the 'wish' type things or 'when I go to ______ be sure to _______' type of things. So there's no hurry. But I think it would be better in the long run to have less places to look. <br><br>Does that all make sense and seem to be a good direction?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 March 2011 at 15:42 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Melisa. "Does that all make sense and seem to be a good direction?" According to me YES.<br>For me The system is simple. <br><br>IF it is actionable by soon &gt; Put it on SF<br>IF it actionable in the future or if there is a due date or a specific day &gt; Pu in in your agenda (IF possible a paper agenda which never live your office. <br>IF It's a someday may be action or a non actionable thing by now a stuff... put it in OF<br>IF it's a note or a thinking about a project or a comment or a list of stuff such as a list of restaurant or good place, or a note about people put it in Evernote. I have created a bridge beetween the 2  systems with INBOX, PROJECT .... in Evernote and it works very well. But it's still perfectible.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 March 2011 at 18:13 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been sorting through similar issues. I've found that pure data-entry tasks are a non-starter for me, e.g., entering all my paper items into OmniFocus—even if they are only brief placeholders. I end up with all my paper in a stagnant "to enter" pile, which is ultimately no better than piling it on my desk.<br><br>I didn't get any of this to work until I allowed paper things to live in their own parallel universe. My 43-folder tickler file has been functioning nicely for most of a year now, and I treat it as part of my calendar.<br><br>At one point, I experimented with all-paper storage. I thought printing out my computer stuff into a paper system would be easier than entering all my paper into the computer. I soon discovered that most of my computer stuff could only be handled at the computer. Printing it all out, only to bring the paper back to the computer later on, grew increasingly silly.<br><br>The policy I've since settled on is: things that originate in the computer stay in the computer, and things that originate on paper stay on paper. I only convert from one to the other if there is a specific, compelling reason to do so for that item. The major such reasons are searchability (easy retrieval later on inside the computer) and portability (printing out reports/lists to take somewhere).<br><br>Now that I'm in SF, I jot down references to computer files/emails/bookmarks as needed. For calendar &amp; reminders, I am still happy with my dual computer/paper systems.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2011 at 1:48 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Funny, for me portability means putting it in the computer. Since a few months I'm the proud owner of an 11" MacBook Air that I take everywhere. Before that, portability meant printing, as for you, but sometimes I was lugging around several inches of paper. The MacBook is much lighter and slimmer than that!<br><br>BTW, I agree with your policy of a parallel paper universe, only converting in specific cases, works great.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2011 at 8:23 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I vote with the parallel but not identical universe.<br><br>If there's no reason to change the form something arrives in, I leave it. Bills that arrive as email go to a folder on the computer. Bills that arrive as paper go to a paper folder. All that happens after I pay it. Before then they stay in the email or paper "to be dealt with at least weekly" folder.<br><br>Most of my work is project-based, so everything to do with the project goes in that folder. If there's a deadline, suitable milestones (including "open the folder") go in the calendar.<br><br>Very rarely I have something that's date-based, like show tickets. They go in my wallet or are stapled to the calendar.<br><br>Very rarely, when things are really busy, I'll put things in piles by date as they're ready to go. I know that everything I'll need for that day is in that pile. Often the top item in the pile is a list. Anything that isn't ready yet stays in its project folder, with appropriate reminders so I get it ready to go.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2011 at 20:02 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>malisa,<br><br>You wrote: "I felt daily/43 folders was overkill."<br><br>I suggest you try a real 43-folders tickler file.  Use center-tab folders for the 12 months, and left- or right-tab folders for the 31 days.  It's true that some task reminders don't need to be on a specific day.  I use the upcoming Sat or Sun folder for weekend-chore reminders,  Day 28 for end-of-month things, etc.  The wonderful thing about this type of tickler file is that it is perpetual –&nbsp;you can put things in for upcoming years or even a specific date anytime in the future.  But it does take discipline –&nbsp;if you don't process it fairly early every day, you won't trust it.<br><br>I put all my reminders in my tickler file, except for fixed-time appointments or all-day events, which go into my computer calendar program.  My SF list has tasks that I am able to do soon.  Each day, I enter these reminders into SF, or defer them to a later date within the tickler.<br><br>Regarding scanning paper into the computer, or printing emails etc., I do some of both.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2011 at 20:43 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To acquire the critical habit of looking in your daily folders every day:<br><br>Keep something you use every morning in the folder. I was putting my "today list" in tomorrow's folder each evening. You might use your car key or anything else that will fit.<br><br>Or, if you already check something every day, place a note there to check today's folder.<br>When I decided to keep my"today list" elsewhere, I added "check day folder" at the top of the list, and it stays there perpetually. By now, I think I could remove the reminder without forgetting to check the folder.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2011 at 22:11 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've found that I'm not checking my tickler like I should. I plan to disband it. I may make another attempt this summer, and maybe I'll go the full-bore 43 folders. I can only see that being successful if my desk/office are inviting enough to make me want to be there. We'll see. <br><br>I mentioned using OmniFocus for some things. I've been pretty successful putting my recurring/repeating tasks into OF. I started with a small group of things and I'm adding as I go. This didn't work for me in the past, but I think it's because I either assigned due dates that weren't really due dates, just wishful thinking, and because I had things start every x days/weeks etc. I realized that the one of the strengths of OF is the customization of repeat intervals (I know it also has shortcomings, but don't seem to have any of the needs that highlights them). I've been using a particular calendar in ical for these things, but that dilutes my calendar. I'm taking these recurring things that OF tells me I need to do and entering into my SF list. <br><br>Wrap up: <br>For REALLY date specific things, I'll use my calendar. <br>For things that SHOULD be done every X period of time, I'll use OF, then enter those into my SF list in the appropriate column.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 20:33 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Haha –&nbsp;I like the idea of leaving a critical item, such as a car key, in the next day's tickler folder.  <br><br>Another thing that one can do, each evening, is to dump all Pending paperwork (which I keep in a tray below my In tray) into the next day's folder.  I turn these papers vertically (portrait orientation), so they stick out of the folder, in order to separate them from the new reminders (which go directly into my In tray).  For me, a completely clean desktop is somewhat unnatural, and a reminder that I haven't checked my tickler file yet.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 22:41 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The only use for a tickler file I've ever found is for keeping papers relating to entries in my calendar, e.g. theatre tickets, papers for a meeting, itineraries. For that sort of thing it is very useful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 22:49 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm with Mark. Use the calendar to Remember things.  Then once reminded look for the matching file - which may be in a dated folder or not. I vote Not.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 23:49 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The potential pitfall associated with using either a 43-folders-style tickler file or a calendar is the same:  you might forget to check it in time. <br><br>Please realize that we were discussing tricks or hacks for remembering to check the next day's folder.  We weren't suggesting that it was the best place to store car keys or misc. paperwork.  We could've suggested putting a push-pin on the next date on the calendar, and then hanging the car keys on that pin, for those who struggle with remembering to check the calendar.<br><br>Putting theater tickets into the proper day's folder is a good way to avoid losing them.  They could also be put into the previous day's folder, to serve as a reminder of the event itself, if you're likely to forget checking your calendar but are better at remembering to process your tickler folder each day.<br><br>I see no reason for cluttering up my calendar with simple reminders of tasks to be completed.  I reserve it for fixed-time appointments and all-day or multi-day events.  Anything fluid or vague in terms of date &amp; time can be better handled with a combination of tickler and to-do (SF) list, IMHO.<br><br>Another great thing about using a tickler reminder, instead of overusing the calendar, is that each reminder is a separate sheet of paper or index card.  For recurring tasks, I add notes or log my activities on the reminder sheet itself.  I could also scribble all sorts of notes onto a paper calendar, but once the month is gone, those notes are lost.  My paper reminders remain, however.  So I know, for example, when I actually last changed my furnace filter (Dec, plan was Nov), because it's logged on the sheet that is still in my tickler file to remind me to change it again in May.<br><br>I also use my tickler file for coupons.  Previously, I had a big box for these.  I struggled with trying to figure out the best way to deal with coupons.  Since they all have expiration dates, I now put them into the appropriate month or day folder.  I don't often use coupons, but I can quickly look at the next month folder, or the next few days' folders, to see if there are any useful ones.  When I process today's folder, I look at any coupons that have landed there.  If a coupon is expiring today, I might carry it around or just throw it away.  If the expiration is a few days off, I'll either carry it around or move it to the expiration day's folder.  It may not be the best solution, but at least now I don't have a box full of mostly-expired coupons!<br><br>So I think there are several valid uses for a tickler file, other than auxiliary storage for items related to calendar entries.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 April 2011 at 0:54 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In my case, the main value of the tickler file is that I don't have a paper calendar. I consolidated three paper calendars into a set of shared Google calendars, and then I just needed a place to put paper-based stuff. I also tend to tuck quick reminders in my tickler files, jotted on index cards. If I had a paper calendar, I would jot them on the paper calendar instead.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 April 2011 at 5:34 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ubi, I agree about those coupons and maintenance items. The tickler is so much smoother than the calendar for those! Plus, I hate them cluttering my calendar, whether it is electronic or paper. And the tracking, like your example of the furnace, is perfect, zero overhead.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 April 2011 at 7:01 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Malisa said, "I can only see that being successful if my desk/office are inviting enough to make me want to be there. "<br><br>Maybe "make desk/office inviting" should be a priority project. Or maybe it should be, "Create inviting work area somewhere" followed by, "Clear out old work area. Or maybe, "Create inviting temporary work area" followed by, "Clear out old work area and make it inviting."<br><br>I found simple things like a good file cabinet that I can get to were well-worth the expense. The room looks cheerier and the filing gets done. Moving old, never-consulted files out of prime storage also helped. It's almost pleasant to put papers away when it's easy.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2011 at 19:59 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, it's been an ongoing project since...I can't recall. I think it was our February school-break that I got it sort of pulled together. My 'office' is the only room besides kitchen and baths that wasn't carpeted in the fall, so when the other rooms had to be emptied, it became a dumping ground. I've got almost all of the 'foreign' matter out of there and I did buy a wonderful, 3-drawer lateral file (used, great deal!) filing cabinet just before the carpeting. So the files are great. <br><br>DH and I are both office-supply junkies and what remains to be sorted are the oodles of supplies that are thrown into my shelves and drawers sort of willy-nilly. That and some files and other things that DH has given me charge of that he used to have in his office (which has turned into more of a den). <br><br>It's definitely a 'little and often' project that I keep doing parts of. However I'm home sick today (no voice, feel fine, hard to teach though) and it's going to be a C2 little and often task for the weekend!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2011 at 16:21 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sounds like you're well on your way!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2011 at 21:21 | Cricket</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
