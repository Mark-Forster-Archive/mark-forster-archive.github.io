If it's for reference, then I need/want to store it somewhere. I've always had a "just in case" mentality in regards to squirreling away info, which of course leads to heaps of physical and digital detritus. When I've upgraded my PC systems and gone from, say, Info Select to some other system (usually  Word or text files), I've found that I rarely needed any of the info I'd saved. <br><br>I bought Devon Think Pro when I entered grad school a few years ago, and while it's slick, I find myself just info-dumping into it. And I think I now have another info-pile that will be of little use to me.<br><br>I can adopt the "just in time" mentality when it's a focused project (ie, finding a new hot water heater), but it's harder when I find a specific Mark Forster blog post that I want to keep for my personal library on the off-chance I'll need it one day because it speaks to some technique or mode of thought or value that captured my attention. (And web sites do go away....though not for a long time, I hope!)<br><br>I've wondered about how to create a system of dismissal similar to DWM or Autofocus for old or no longer useful info. If I haven't opened or accessed the info in a year or so, then delete it?<br><br>It just struck me that the Noguchi system could work well for this -- frequently used info finds its way to the front of the file, unused info is sorted to the back and could probably safely be disposed of.<br><br>Sorry for the info-blather! But I do feel I've burdened myself unnecessarily with the care and feeding of too much information.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 November 2011 at 14:02 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, yes, the Noguchi system makes a great "waterfall" decluttering scheme. I hoard a lot of info too, and my approach is to let it sit and go stale, until it becomes easy for me to dump it. Forcing myself to purge items after 6 months or so has proved futile, and my decisions are not very good. Boxing it up and waiting longer (a quite embarrassingly long time) makes it a snap. And it doesn't really take up that much space, in boxes. As long as one has a garage or basement or attic with a couple of spare corners—a couple of tall piles—I say the space can be reasonably sacrificed for the ease of purging.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 November 2011 at 15:19 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"information is either for action or reference"<br><br>I've taken the hypothesis that all information exists to be used.<br><br>If there's no reason to use the information, it should be destroyed.<br>If it needs to be kept, there must be an answer to the question "how will it be used?"<br>Answer that, and you know how to organize that information.<br><br>My hypothesis, anyway.

I say, if you happen upon something old that you don't need, delete it in that moment.

In my email program, I move all timely "FYI" messages (the vast majority of emails I get) to the Bulletin folder.
