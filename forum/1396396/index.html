If I am writing tasks they are short actions I should be able to do and not need to re-write. For example, call architect A about sending qualifications.  I make the call it is done.  If he is not there, I may note I am waiting for a call back, or if I don't like him, I may write a new task like call architect B about his qualifications.<br><br>If I am putting projects on my list, then of course work on project X or build dream house would need to be re-written many times until complete.  But, what is the need, most people would know they are building a house, they would not loose track of the project, it would be the tasks they would need to plan and act on. So, then we are back to project management and they should not even be in the TM system.  They may need a master list of their projects if they have many but this is also not a TM system. <br><br>I started my TM journey looking for a system to bridge this need and quite frankly and not sure I am all that much closer as I keep experimenting and trying to find the blend of TM and PM resources to make this go smoother.   Thanks all for the interesting discussions of late and looking forward to the new release by Mark.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2011 at 22:43 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting...<br>Might I suggest 2 questions/remarks:<br><br>1 - For me at least, "Task Management" and "Time Management" are not the same thing. Am I the only one who sees it this way? Why would managing your task be managing your time? The only way these are connected is that with a Task List, you can be more "efficient" with your time use hence leaving you more time to do something else but that's it. Even with Autofocus, you only choose what your next action will be now through a myriad of possibilities by determining if it feels right to do it now. It doesn't mean that you get a good balance of family time versus alone time for example (which for me is closer to management).<br><br>2 - Taking the above in consideration, I agree that projects should not go in Task Management systems but they DEFINITELY should go in Time Management Systems. Maybe, just maybe (and this is the way I approach it personally) There should be no "project tasks" in a Time Management System...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 0:38 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've lately had thoughts like yours Gerry.

I'm not sure I see your distincton though. As far as I can figure, the only thing about a task that needs managing is when you do it. I agree that there are different sorts of tasks and it's important to balance the mix, but that balance comes in picking what to do or not do next. So to me it's all the same thing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 12:25 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry: I believe Mark would propose all simple tasks go in the task list, and those would include:<br>put garbAge out, plan project x, walk 3 miles, read some war and peace, do next thing in project x, learn Stairway on guitar. <br><br>Some of the above are repeated tasks. You do some now, and some later. You can make a system that skips rewriting but Mark and many don't see that as a hassle. You could use postit flags and move them instead of writing. You could make a system that just looks at tasks or just checkmarks them or whatever. I reaally don't think that issue matters. <br><br>As for projects, Mark would have us plan projects independently of task/time management and just feed project tasks into the time allocation process. This works okay.  I think you are more inclined to feed projects into the time allocation process. This also will work provided the system rules aren't applied to choosing which tasks in the project you do. You can in fact have a process that does both concurrently, which may or may not be better.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 12:39 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One thing I have been struggling with in the past 2 weeks (when I went to paper with SF) - but which also has been a problem before - is that I can't find a good balance between my normal small tasks and my projects. I have one project for each of the courses I'm taking for my Masters, and added each project on my AF list as 'Proj. - Course Title'.<br><br>I find that that one line saying 'Proj. - Course Title' is just not alluring enough to get started on. Adding the first task kind of helps, but then not that much gets done...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 16:48 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find it's important to actually look at the projects.  If you see "Course Title", it's a good idea to grab your binder for the course, and read the front page to see what things might need doing.  Then you can decide if it's something worth pursuing now.<br><br>Instead of a binder for the course, you might want a binder or section dedicated to just things you need to do in each course.  Start with the course outlines, maybe, and the list of assignments and tests scheduled.  Or if it's a project oriented course, it'll be your own outline of the steps you need to follow to complete the project.<br><br>Whatever it is, you gotta look at it.  Mark would suggest then picking something and copying that item into SF.  That's up to you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 18:00 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"I find that that one line saying 'Proj. - Course Title' is just not alluring enough to get started on"<br><br>That is my point, this is not a task and an action you can take.  Project management is just task management of a project.  So you either need to write what you need to do for the course, or write review the course syllabus for the today's work or something that is an action.  Again, I prefer something you can do in a day or less so it is done and you move on.  I find this builds momentum and focus.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 18:43 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm reading a book now on the psychology of success.
