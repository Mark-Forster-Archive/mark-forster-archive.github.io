That we haven't reached that point with artificial systems (computers) yet is a matter of time.<br><br>Please note that I write "It is my belief". That belief is heavily influenced by books like "Godel, Escher, Bach", and more recently, "The Illusion of conscious will" by David Wegner, but I must confess I'm not articulate enough to reproduce their arguments here.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 March 2014 at 15:58 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Nicole: in fact such form of reductionism is usually simply refuted by history itself.... It was Marx who told "Life is nothing but organization of proteins", authors you mentioned (and many others) now say: consciousness is nothing but byproduct of distinct level of system organization... It repeats again and again in the history. Also "man is nothing but a machine" (La Mettrie)<br><br>My favorite counterargument is simple and folk: but not EVERY form of protein organization stems in life. Not EVERY superlevel of system organization stems in consciousness (there is 10 to the power of 15-20 neuron connections in a brain - we can find systems (e.g. molecules) with so many connections which are not conscious). Not EVERY machine stems in a man etc. And this simple argument makes these reductionistic theories incomplete.<br><br>So, I believe consciousness is still much more mystery...than many bestseller authors is willing to admit:-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 March 2014 at 17:35 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark: and Christ consciousness is when the "them" are seen as "you" - a unitive consciousness, not separative?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 March 2014 at 21:42 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Mark: the example in your counterargument doesn't hold up. A single, even complex, molecule doesn't have anywhere near as many connections as the human brain. But more importantly, the connections in the brain are not fixed, but can be changed as a result of outside influences. So it's not only a matter of the number of connections, but also the nature of these connections. No single connection in the human brain serves exactly the same function as any other connection. I can't think of any other system, protein-based or machine, that would have such complexity.<br><br>Another argument against your reason to abolish atheism and agnosticism is the Turing test. If a machine or computer would be so complex that you as a human can't find out if it's a machine or not, then how can you be sure that machine is not conscious of itself? And if you can't tell, how is that different from you being conscious of yourself versus all the other people in the world? You assume they are conscious because they are like you, but why couldn't that be true of a machine?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2014 at 8:55 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>BTW, Mark, I do respect the conclusion you've come to.

It is consistent with reason but steps beyond into areas that are neither provable nor refutable.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2014 at 19:44 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Nicol, I am not sure whether you spoke about my counterargument (or Mark...). If mine, I would say: <br>1. You described theory that ANY system with sufficient complexity will gain consciousness <br>2. I say that many systems in fact have greater complexity than human brain - if we define complexity by number of particles and possible relations between them - e.g. there will be around as many molecules in 1 liter of water as connections in human brain (and there are definitely physical relations between molecules of H2O) - around 10**23<br>3. You say that it is not valid, because the system must have plasticity and modularity and....be brain-like....with brain-like connections. But this denies your point 1. That ANY system with sufficient complexity will gain consciousness. So it must be human-brain-like system...which comes to redux: brain or other exactly-like-brain system have consciousness. Such theories in fact do not explain anything.<br><br>Turing test is about artificial intelligence, not about (dis)prove of consciousness. Similarly - there is famous Searle`s Chinese room experiment as sound counterargument to such interpretation of Turing test. Shortly, you cannot *prove* existence of consciousness. There is no way (because you use so called third-person approaches to prove first-person, phenomenological experience and there is gap between them which we cannot bridge with our methods.) You can just show that object/machine/other being behaves in a way similar to human (see Chalmer`s zombie problem). Nothing what would *explain* mystery of consciousness any further.<br><br>(if you did not comment to my post, I am sorry for misunderstanding)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2014 at 19:52 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Daneb, thanks for the mention of Searle's Chinese Room experiment - I hadn't heard of that before.

So yes, I was replying to you.<br><br>No, I wasn't saying that a system must be brain-like to have consciousness. I intended to say that the complexity of the brain is much bigger than determined by the number of elements and the number of connections. Complexity is also determined by the *nature* of those connections. If a connection can be only present or not present, then it's a matter of numbers. But in the brain, connections are graded: strong or weak on a gradual scale, easily triggered or difficult to trigger on a gradual scale, and that adds tremendously to the complexity of the brain. It's not just a matter of number of neurons and number of connections.<br><br>Your comparison to a liter of water is not what I would describe as "connections". Every connection between two water molecules behaves exactly the same. That's not how it works in the brain. Two molecules of water could be interchanged, without affecting the behavior of the liter of water. If you do that in the brain, the system as a whole changes, because no two neurons in the brain serve exactly the same function.<br><br>The Searle Chinese room experiment is exactly my point: you cannot prove consciousness, so how do you know that another organism or system doesn't have it? And if you can't be sure of the absence or presence of consciousness in any other organism, how does that prove or disprove the existence of a supreme being?<br><br>So I still don't see how the existence of consciousness would lead anyone to abandon atheism or agnosticism.
