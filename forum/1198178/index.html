I don't know exactly why you can't post.<br>1 - Can you tell me what browser you are using?<br>2 - Did you create a googlewave account with the same email address you used for the googlegroup )i.e. can you login googlewave?)<br>If it helps, look at the video on the main page of the website,... I show you how to subscribe there. Also, I recently incorporated standard comments on all the videos, so even though it wouldn't be in the wave, it could be read by anybody.<br><br>I'd like to answer your question clearly so I'd like to understand your question better. What do you mean by allocate; do you mean, "how do I choose which task to do when" or "which energy type to give to which task"?<br><br>You seem to have a good handle on your energies by the way... You have your "habits" that evolved from the demands on you. I think it's perfect!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 August 2010 at 11:58 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Maybe it has something to do with Google Wave being "terminated"?<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10877768">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10877768</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 August 2010 at 18:33 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There is a bit at the end of the first video Erik made on changing how you think about the kind of energy an activity takes. I've been working on that. Because I have a lot of maintenance in my life I've been working to making some things more fun or more restful. Sometimes that is just challenging myself to do it faster or go slower and enjoy the process.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 August 2010 at 19:48 | Erin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;What do you mean by allocate; do you mean, "how do I choose which task to do when" or "which energy type to give to which task"?&gt;<br><br>OK, I watched the long video again and made some notes and it's clearer now (text has it's uses after all).<br><br>Nevertheless, is there some kind of routine or method as to which energy type task you usually do when?<br><br>Thanks for the comments on Google Wave, I'll try again later in the week.<br><br>Erin, I try that too; if I stay up a bit later reading stuff on the web I have to floss my teeth at the same time  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 August 2010 at 23:48 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Frank<br>Thanks Frank! I am aware of the situation... People can still create new accounts and the system can be used at least until the end of the year. I'm following this really closely and that is why I started to make changes on my site like standard comments and such.<br><br>@Smileypete<br>Yes, there is kind of a routine to what kind of tasks I do when. It's a lot like eating actually :) I start with some interesting tasks (rest/entertainment) similar to a Breakfast if you will to get me involved in my day and also in my system. Then I tackle the management tasks for they are the ones I dread the most. I have discovered that they eat (pun intended) a lot on my emotional energy while not really depleting the others (I know I said it differently in the video and I will make a new version at one point... I'm learning it as much as everybody else :). When I eat, I eat the things I like less first and then enjoy the rest. So that part is like Lunch full and hearty and more business like. I usually intersperse some rest in the middle of that. I end the day with most of the entertainment kind of things to have the fun that I deserve. Its like a nice Supper you enjoy in good company and it prepares you for a nice long sleep :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 August 2010 at 0:34 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I again agree with your observation on energy.  The tasks that require a lot of emotional energy need to be done first.  It doesn't matter if they are mental or physical energy tasks.<br><br>And I knew only one other person eating the least favored things first.  It was my grandfather and he was very meticulous about it.  But to think about it he did his dreaded task first thing in the morning.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 August 2010 at 23:04 | Ilse</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Something I noticed about procrastination the other day, if I start feeling bad for putting something off, strangely the thought of actually doing it also makes me feel bad too! When it should be the opposite as I'd get it out of the way.<br><br>This is where a bit of rephrasing/chunking down comes in, just think of a small part of it in a different way and I don't feel so bad about making a start. OK it is just mind games, but often works for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 August 2010 at 23:47 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yeah, reformulating it is the key!<br><br>I think the reason why you feel bad at at the thought of doing is that you will have to face the consequences of your acts (or not acting in this instance). What I mean is that you will have to take a look in the mirror and see that you have not respected your engagement. It's at least the reason why I feel bad. I feel I've let it slip on the side because I'm lazy... Which is often not the case. Rephrasing it does addresses the root problem of that "you haven't thought about it enough" ;)<br><br>I will touch on this in the next video and last video of the series on Lists and Habits and look at how to think about something without procrastinating :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2010 at 1:52 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@smileypete<br>on August 10 you wrote<br>"OK it is just mind games, but often works for me."<br><br>A thought:  Is that statement any more or less accurate than <br>"procrastination itself is 'just mind games' ".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 August 2010 at 16:44 | John Angus (Anguish)</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
