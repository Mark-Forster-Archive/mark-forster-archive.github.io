This has led me to think about how one might actually evaluate or even quantify how well a particular system works, either in general, or for a particular person.<br><br>In a work context you could perhaps imagine a scenario where as a manager you insist that your group uses a particular system, and then over say a three month period quantify the productivity of the group by some standard measure (personally in practice I don't think this would actually tell you much apart from producing a meaningless number, but that is a different story). Anyway, this approach is inappropriate for those of us who have sufficient control over our lives to choose our own time-management system.<br><br>As Mark Foster has so lucidly stated, there is only a certain amount of work we can do in a day, so by changing time-management systems, we are primarily changing which tasks we choose to do when, and which perhaps we choose never to do. Afterwards, how do we then evaluate that over a given period we have made more or less the "right" choices for us at the time? We might feel more in control, or more productive, but in fact still be spending too much time on the "wrong" tasks.<br><br>Any ideas about how to think about this?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 22:47 | Jaroslav</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jaroslav<br><br>I think a good way of measuring productivity would be based on an analysis of procrastination vs necessary tasks.  For example, if I define "work" as any necessary task, whether it be checking email, a significant work project, laundry, tax return etc, i.e. a task that under any system has to be done, and say assume a working day to be 10 hours (ie to allow for home tasks as well as work tasks) then an analysis of how much of that 10 hour day is spent on necessary tasks will give a good indication.<br><br>If for example, I was just "busy" for those 10 hours, and, when I had decided to do project work, procrastinated by doing the laundry for 1 hour, checking email for 1 hour and watched TV because I was bored for 2 hours, at the end of the day I would "feel" I had wasted 4 hours and only "worked" for 6.  In fact I would have had 80% time productivity because 2 of those procrastinating hours were actually spent on necessary tasks, but just not the tasks that I felt I "ought" to be doing. (In fact actual productivity would probably be a little less than 80% because of the boredom and guilt factors causing a slowing down in the work).<br><br>With AF I would be more likely to work effectively on tasks from my lists.  If working on necessary tasks equates to productivity there is a strong likelihood that my productivity will be closer to 100%.<br><br>The question as to whether they are the "wrong" tasks should actually be addressed by AF.  If an item is necessary it needs to be done.  Doing that item is productivity.  We will only be non-productive if we are doing unnecessary tasks and AF is designed to ensure that we do not do unnecessary tasks by means of the dismissal procedure.  The concept of "wrong" seems more to be tied to a perception of importance.  Doing the laundry is as necessary as doing a tax return.  Watching TV is generally not.  TV watching is fine - at the right time but not as a procrastinator.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 23:57 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jaroslav, for a number of years I was self-employed and as that type of professional, it would be easy to calculate # of billable hours.  You're more productive if they increase, and at a certain point, are capable of raising your billable rate because your efficiency and effectiveness have increased.  I also kept a detailed time log during this time - I could have told you how many times a day I went and got a coffee and for how long.  It's very educational to do this, and I think everyone should do it at least once in their careers.  I was a procrastinator at the time though, and I recall that if I got more than 4 billable hours in in a day, it was a good day.  Pretty sad.<br><br>We had major productivity initiatives at one of my former jobs which I was the lead on.  We looked at # of days to complete month / quarter end, hours of overtime, # of staff.  My personal goal was that everyone on the team went home on time, even during year end.  That meant that we were working effectively.   It wasn't a normal job scenario as it was a Corporate Reporting department, which by necessity means that there are certain times of the year where you have a looming deadline which isn't negotiable at all and the rest of the time it's pretty slow.  The key is to take advantage of the slow times to prepare as much as possible for the busy times.  <br><br>I think I could quite easily measure how productive I was on my home renovation project via a comparison of hours spent on one method vs. the other.   The only problem is I can't follow any other methods but AF with it and I tried - believe me, I tried.  For four wasted years I tried. :-(<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 April 2009 at 2:48 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I also think you could give a qualitative measure at the end of your day with whatever method just asking yourself the question "was I productive today?"  I don't think most people are that divorced from reality that they would answer yes when they really weren't.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 April 2009 at 2:56 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jaroslav,<br>Suppose you are at the station and you take at train. How can you tell then if you are in the right or in the wrong train? Indeed, it depends on where you want to go. The trains in itself are not right or wrong.<br>I guess it's the same with productivity: if at the end of the day (or month, or year) you end up somewhere where you don't want to be - a messy house, a stressed feeling, an angry boss or a low income - I think you've taken the wrong train or done the wrong actions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 April 2009 at 5:57 | Canta</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with Canta. The real question is not how many tasks you have carried out, but what the overall result is.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 April 2009 at 10:12 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jaroslav wrote:<br><br>'We might feel more in control, or more productive, but in fact still be spending too much time on the "wrong" tasks.'<br><br>I believe the 'little and often' approach helps, if a task does soon turn out to be wrong there is less chance that a lot of time has been spent early on.<br><br>The 'little and often' approach can also also give more time for subconscious thinking about tasks in between doing a little, which can flag up whether they're wrong in some way. <br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 April 2009 at 23:25 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good point smileypete.  I find that having all of my tasks recorded, and doing the tasks I feel like doing, my mind is freer to focus on the next task, or on planning, or on what else I need to add to my list to progress a project, rather than just feeling grumpy because I don't want to be doing whatever it is that I am doing!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 April 2009 at 23:49 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for all the helpful ideas.<br><br>I certainly would agree with Canta and Mark Foster that the real test has to be in terms of the goals that you accomplish over a given period, with the same amount of effort. That period does need to be longer than a day, my guess would be an absolute minimum of a month, and realistically three or more months. So, to compare systems you would need to set up two fairly similar sets of goals, work at them for three months in turn and then evaluate to what extent you have met them. I presume that this is what Mark Foster did at least informally when he was developing AF, and came to the conclusion that AF led to him achieving a higher proportion of his goals with the same effort, or the same proportion of goals with less effort. I wonder if anyone else has tried this kind of experiment?<br><br>I think however the situation is a little more complicated in that most of us are pretty bad at having a clear set of consistent goals. In Canta's analogy, we don't want to reach one destination, but three or four simultaneously at opposite ends of the country. Whilst this won't be solved by a time management system, I did find that Mark's books, and my subsequent implementation of a DIT like system made it much clearer that it simply wasn't possible to achieve all my desired goals given the number of hours in the day, and I had to cut down on my commitments and goals. I think Mark writes about this very clearly in his book, effectively explaining how there is feedback from the DIT system back into your overall goals. In Canta's analogy, many of us would probably accept a different destination in the price of the train was a lot cheaper, or the journey a lot quicker. I find this feedback more difficult to obtain in AF. Certainly there is the dismissal process, but this works at the individual task level and at the moment I find its not showing me which overall goals right now might be unrealistic and should perhaps be dropped. And, if I do drop such a goal, how does that fit into AF, given Mark's repeated advice that we should enter all possible tasks that crop up?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 April 2009 at 23:57 | Jaroslav</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jaroslav:<br><br>Actually what I recommend with AF is that you should not start off with a list of goals, but should let them emerge from working the system. In other words you let the system take you where it will (bearing in mind that the system is only bringing out what is already inside you). Now obviously this is going to work very differently in different situations. Some of us don't have much control over what our work goals are - they are imposed on us.<br><br>But basically the answer to your question about dropping goals is that you don't need to drop a goal. The system will just stop working on that goal.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2009 at 12:29 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jaroslav<br><br>I certainly found what Mark said to be true - certain projects I was working on before Christmas have been dismissed until a more appropriate time, and others that I had wanted to progress but not made time for are now tootling along nicely.  Not only that but my project management has improved out of all recognition so I can see at a glance what has been done, what needs doing, and what I may want to do in the future.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2009 at 12:51 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>your last comment above was for me an incredibly insightful one, and dare I say it, perhaps a bit of a Eureka moment for me. I need to think about it  a bit more, but at first sight it implies that in some ways AF is actually a very revolutionary approach, and dare I say it, quite subversive in some ways. <br><br>It renders the question with which I started this thread a meaningless one as it suggests that one's productivity within AF is measured on a completely different scale to one's productivity within DIT or any other system I know of.<br><br>I think that this is the first time I feel that I am starting to understand what AF is about, and if you do choose to write more about AF, I think it would be great if it was an aspect that you expanded on. I think it is terribly important.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2009 at 22:58 | Jaroslav</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jaroslav:<br><br>You have inspired me to put "Write more about AF" on my task list!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 April 2009 at 15:31 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jaraslov, keep posting so Mark is encouraged to write more!<br><br>Sorry to beat this one to death, but...<br><br>The system will drop the goal because you experience resistance of some sort to that goal.  Therefore it isn't a *right* goal for you, or not for you at this time.  So you will get rid of all of your "should" goals?  <br><br>(BTW, I think most of my 10 goals this year were "should goals" - and I "should" know better by now - one that I'm working a lot on isn't what I originally thought should be one of my highest priorities.)<br><br>In a sense then, wouldn't AF move you towards identifying / following your "passions" / enthusiasm without going through some new agey book?   And those passions may not be as glorious, earth-shattering or profound as you'd always thought they would be, but they fit you?<br><br>I just remembered this quote, and I think it fits: <br><br>"Don't ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you come alive.  And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive."  <br>Harold Whitman<br><br>In reading Earl Nightingale's bio (founder of Nightingale-Conant), it almost sounds like he sort of moved into new areas - even creating totally new industries, as if he were following an AF system without establishing goals - he just evolved.  This is from the Essence of Success, but also in his audio "Lead the Field" - very good stuff.  <br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nightingale.com/AE_Article~i~167~article~TheRiverortheGoal.aspx">http://www.nightingale.com/AE_Article~i~167~article~TheRiverortheGoal.aspx</a><br><br><br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 April 2009 at 17:19 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>at a slight tangent, whilst you are adding items to your task list, what are the chances of persuading the publisher to re-issue<br><br>How to Make Your Dreams Come True<br><br>Its been listed on Amazon UK as currently unavailable for at least a year, and I am sure I am not the only person who would love to get hold of a copy.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 April 2009 at 22:18 | Jaroslav</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jaroslav<br><br>There's no chance of its being reprinted.
