I am just eager to hear what Seraphim has to say about that, because of the way he tends to think about these matters.<br><br>In another thread Seraphim wrote:<br><br>&gt; As I wrote about earlier, I've been exploring how to get a stronger sense of completion and closure to the day, like DIT always seems to give…<br><br>This sense of completion entails the question of wether we have worked enough on a task for today in order to be able to mark it of as "done."<br><br>My trouble with that has always been, that we never can know for sure if enough was enough. We may project into the future that such and such an amount of effort for today would be suffice to reach the goal in the end, but we never know.<br><br>With some tasks it is easier. Email for instance, we just clear the lot. But with the more creative projects, how can we know when we worked enough on it? We usually just give up for today at some point.<br><br>I don't see a difference here between DIT and all the AF versions. You take a look at your listed work and then do some of it. At some point you decide to stop working for now or for today. The deciding reasons usually do not come from the list itself, at least not directly. We have to decide based on some estimates and just call it a day at some point.<br><br>So, this aforementioned sense of completion, what is it based on? Why wouldn't this be there with an AF list?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 May 2019 at 12:05 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christopher:<br><br>The sense of closure and completion that comes from DIT relates to working on everything you are currently engaged on, rather than finishing everything.<br><br>What is important is that everything is kept alive in your mind. Constant engagement with a project or a problem results in wider thinking, new insights and constant advancing. If you let a project alone for a period, even quite a short period, it tends to go out of your mind and your thinking on the subject gets stale and dusty.<br><br>So the fact that you've worked on a project that day is more important than how much you worked on it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 May 2019 at 16:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would tend to agree with Mark. With DIT, the things on my list were either one-off tasks, recurring tasks, or ongoing projects. The day would feel "complete" if all the one-offs were completed, all the recurring tasks were completed, and all the ongoing projects were moved forward. "How much" doesn't seem to matter so much, as long as there was some real work done. <br><br>There are some caveats. Sometimes I'd be mostly absorbed in one main project, and give only cursory attention to other projects. "Cursory" meaning the "open the file" kind of treatment - no real work at all, just a cursory check of status, etc. This usually did not feel very satisfying, despite the significant work completed on one of the projects. I needed to make SOME progress, at least get closure on an email thread, complete a phone call, SOMETHING. But it really does't take very much. Small tasks really do help to keep the momentum going, and with most projects, that's all I really need. If I am doing that with all of my open projects, I really do feel on top of my work, and my days really do feel complete.<br><br>With Serial No-List, I am finding it's a little more flexible than DIT, because I decide at the beginning of the day what a complete day will be, rather than collecting the tasks automatically during the course of the previous day as with DIT. So if I already know in advance that I won't have time for many projects, I can just write down the one or two things I really want to make sure I get done in between all the meetings (or whatever will be consuming my time). So I can still get that sense of closure and completion, and I feel on top of my day. The rest can wait for a day or two.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 May 2019 at 4:51 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
