After about a month I started writing weekly. Recently, I've been writing it about once every ten days.<br><br>I've written maybe three dialogues with my future self.<br><br>The major aspect of my dream was to change the way that I support myself financially. That involves learning an entirely new skill set. I have been reading and practicing in order to gain these skills. But, so far, I have not successfully acquired them. It is often said in the field that I wish to master that the best way to accomplish this is to find a mentor. I had a few candidates but none of them panned out.<br><br>Then about six weeks ago I casually mentioned my interest (not the new career part) to my current boss. To make a long and complicated story short, today I reached an agreement with a man who has truly towering accomplishments. He will be coming to my office daily to teach me what he knows. <br><br>So, I will be doing--and getting paid for--my current job as I am being taught the skills that I need to be completely self-supporting.<br><br>Until now, my future self was always just out of reach, just beyond my grasp. It was a dream that always seemed not quite ready to be actualized. Today I experienced a seismic shift. <br><br>I am still in the middle of the Halvorson book, which I am enjoying, but I know enough to recognize that the path to the realization of my dream will be bumpy, even painful at times, filled with obstructions requiring countless detours. But it no longer seems so distant and dreamlike. <br><br>I cannot claim that there is a causal connection between the dreams exercises and my almost unbelievable fortune. I only know that something that once seemed unattainable now seems almost routine. My mentor will be coming in to see me in a few days. He is as excited to be working with me as I am with him. I would like to say that you can't make this stuff up. But I did.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2011 at 19:02 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>moises:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I cannot claim that there is a causal connection between the dreams exercises and my almost unbelievable fortune. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Can't you? Would you have "casually mentioned" your interest to your boss if you hadn't done the exercises? Would you have taken his offer on if you hadn't been wedded to your goal by the exercises?<br><br>Opportunities are there all the time, but the object of the exercises is to activate the filtering mechanisms of the brain so that we recognize the opportunities that are relevant to our goals when we see them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2011 at 21:10 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>moises: Thank you for sharing your story. It's delightful and uplifting, and encourages me. I wish you all the best for the path ahead.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2011 at 21:39 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This brings up a murky interesting area that the entire "Dreams" subject seems to be flirting with.<br><br>With a mother that tried every new holistic health solution that came along and a father that is a statistician, I fall in the middle, not skeptically closed, nor blindly follow everything.<br><br>There is an aspect to "Dreams" that seems to be potentially about Law of Attraction.<br><br>I've read the eBook Desired-Outcomes-Implementation-Technology from Gerry <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a> where he talks about Law of Attraction such as The Secret and how it is all bunk. I agree with him in theory. If worked, we'd all be super rich. Another issue about The Secret is what does this mean for those that are sick from cancer, they caused it?<br><br>I've explored such techniques long before The Secret. Was not getting any classwork done in college. No matter how I pushed myself, would find a way to screw it up. So then, one night (inspired by some book, long forgotten), just visualized getting it done. And I just magically got it done the next day and from then on.<br><br>OK, this falls under visualize and various procrastination methods etc. Nothing magic (just felt that way), but great to use. ( and why do I keep forgetting to use it... another topic )<br><br>BUT, there are other cases where it DID feel more magic as moises just posted.<br><br>YES, it could be because moises looked at world in different ways, moved different, felt different to boss, spoke up in new way, and things just came together, nothing magic.<br><br>I've thought about all these pros and cons, and certainly aware of the problems with self test self fulfilling, research on one (self). Yet there are times that results feel beyond just simple change, they DO seem magic.<br><br>I've even set out tests, giving myself hard unlikely things to visualize, such as I will meet this semi-famous person in non easy way (seeing him on street or lecture does not count) and 2 weeks later a work contact I barely knew asked me out to dinner and the famous person was there as well as his other guest. Just the 3 of us and 2 children of my friend. Very odd. Not of any real value, other than to prove that something was working.<br><br>Depending on which of my parents I'm channeling, this is either dreams and attraction and such at work OR is just observation of result. Where you only notice when DOES work, and do not notice when does not.<br><br>So, not answer with this post. Just questions. And certainly plenty of times when seem to NOT be able to get results in life, but this does raise questions, at least for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2011 at 21:51 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>moises - Great story moises!   Thanks!!<br><br>matthewS - You never notice how many Toyota Camrys are on the road till after you've just been looking at one at the car dealership.<br><br>And besides the mental priming, probability is a very funny thing.   We notice the times when "unusual" pairings actually happen (pairing of a thought of someone, and then actually meeting them in reality a short time later).   We don't notice the countless other times when we were thinking of someone and the person did NOT immediately appear.   In fact, it would be extremely improbable if such pairings NEVER occurred.   And it's extremely likely that they will occur SOMETIMES.   We notice them when they do occur, and fail to notice when they don't.  <br><br>Personally I think these are all very important considerations when endeavoring to create one own's luck.  Taleb's "Fooled by Randomness" has some important insights on the topic.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2011 at 23:47 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim - yes, I'm fully aware of all the pitfalls, great book my father had for which I forget title, about dowsing and it really completely is untrue, all simple faults in how we are easily fooled (and which in just searching for now and seeing results, I can see the book made no dent) "Fooled by Randomness" looks interesting, thank you.<br><br>Mark also said this perfectly. Felt this, but never sure how to exaplain.<br>-----<br>Opportunities are there all the time, but the object of the exercises is to activate the filtering mechanisms of the brain so that we recognize the opportunities that are relevant to our goals when we see them.<br>-----<br><br>So armed WITH that knowledge and viewpoint, I've at various times set out experiments. Such as the extreme one of meet a certain semi-famous person and then meet him in amazing way. NOT a simple case of notice when think of someone then meeting them. This was a deliberate test. And not an example of then I was more inspired to tell my boss about something. There were many more tests, that all seem to show events, people and circumstances pulled my way.<br><br>What I DO not know is the edges of what is possible. (yes, tried lottery, so far has not worked). Or how to repeat or what the actual rules are. AND fully aware of all the ways could be fooled.<br><br>At some level, does not matter what "reason" is, as long as get results. After all, just being able to think about something and do something as a human, is really an act of magic every moment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 October 2011 at 20:42 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;I've read the eBook Desired-Outcomes-Implementation-Technology from Gerry <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a> where he talks about Law of Attraction such as The Secret and how it is all bunk.&gt;&gt;<br><br>I got more than a few comments telling me how wrong I was and that I did not understand the LOA or was not doing it right etc.  <br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 October 2011 at 22:36 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>matthewS:<br><br>&lt;&lt; There is an aspect to "Dreams" that seems to be potentially about Law of Attraction. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Well, just for the record I do not believe in the "Law of Attraction" and I had no intention whatsoever of making "Dreams" about it.<br><br>What I do believe is that the brain is a very powerful filter of experience which can lock on to almost any result if we use the right means of activating it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 October 2011 at 0:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; You never notice how many Toyota Camrys are on the road till after you've just been looking at one at the car dealership. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I don't even know what a Toyota Camry looks like, but I do know that as a Porsche owner I notice every single Porsche on the road plus its year, colour, model, specification, etc.(except Cayennes which don't count).

This is an aspect of randomness that is little understood by politicians, judges, lawyers and lobbyists. We are always hearing things like "the incidence of z in X-ville is way above the average". But that's what random events do - cluster. However for every Xville in which the incidence is above average, there will be a Y-ville in which the incidence is way below average.<br><br>See <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.boallen.com/random-numbers.html">http://www.boallen.com/random-numbers.html</a><br><br>Notice the clustering in the _first_ picture, which is true random-number generated.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 October 2011 at 0:49 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;..the brain is a very powerful filter of experience..&gt;&gt;<br><br>Well the brain is a collection of neurons firing.

Quantum physics is surely more use than neuroscience for understanding how consciousness is causal (Schrodinger's cat and all that); your future self live is a possible world which is energised by your dialogues and your consciousness comes into resonance with it. Double-blind drug trials are an attempt in the opposite direction to stop you having  and dialogues with a possible future, as it were.

My dad was hired several times each year for decades by farmers that needed to locate field tiles.  He used two pieces of steel coat hanger wire, bent into an "L" shape.  Held them  loosely parallel to the ground and to each other.  Whenever they would swing and cross each other, there was water directly below.  They actually were hiring him to find where tile may have been broken, so he would locate a tile run, then track it until the wires stopped crossing.  That would be where the tile was broken.
