(Things has an iPhone app, too.) I've been using Things very successfully with DIT for quite a while now, and so I was a bit disappointed when I couldn't see right away how to use it as a vehicle for Autofocus. (My disappointment was sharpened by the fact that Things 1.0 was finally released this weekend, so that I've just paid actual money for it....)<br><br>This morning, though, it struck me that there's a perfectly simple way of making the combination work. The trick I'm using is just to create a new project to correspond to each page of the paper notebook I'd otherwise be using. (I'm using the term 'project' here the way it's used in Things, not the way it's used in, e.g., DIT.) So I now have projects entitled "Page 1", "Page 2", etc., and I can cycle through those projects in just the way I'd cycle through the pages of a paper notebook. What's more, this buys me many of the advantages Frank describes for his electronic implementation in an earlier post:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/622809">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/622809</a> <br><br>In Things, the equivalent of dismissing the remaining tasks on a page will be to render the relevant project ("Page 7", e.g.) inactive, which archives it but removes it from the list in the sidebar, so that you're no longer tempted to cycle through it. It's also quick and easy to make a copy of a task and move it to the last page before checking it off, when it's an unfinished task or a recurring one.<br><br>Finally, there are also a couple of ways to solve what seemed at first sight to be the main problem: enforcing a limit on the number of tasks per page. One option would simply be to select the "Projects" Focus in the sidebar, which then brings up a list of all one's projects (pages) with an item count for each project. You could use that view to check that you haven't added too many items to the last page. If you have, simply create a new page, go back to the overburdened page, select the extra items over your limit (of 30 per page, say), and drag them to the new last page.<br><br>That's a bit clunky, of course (though not as bad as it sounds, perhaps), and involves a bit of work that has no counterpart if you're just using a paper notebook. But there's another, more elegant solution if the screen you're working on is big enough: set the size of your Things window so that it's just big enough to contain 30 items (say). Then you get a straightforward visual cue when it's time to start a new page.<br><br>This works for me because most of the time I'm working with a cinema display attached to my laptop. Admittedly, though, the elegant solution isn't perfect when working from a normal laptop screen. When I unplug, for example, my item-per-page limit, if I want to employ this solution, is 21, or 22 if I move the OS X dock to one side of my screen, or 23 if I hide the Things toolbar, or 24 if I do both...tantalisingly close to the recommended 25-35 lines per page range. I wouldn't like to have my dock on the side of my screen, but perhaps reducing the size of a page to 21 or 22 items per page wouldn't interfere with the smooth running of Autofocus; I don't know.<br><br>Of course, there is a real obstacle to using the elegant solution if you're doing most of the inputting on your iPhone, where you can only see 7-8 items at a time. But the clunkier solution is still an option there....<br><br>Anyway, hope this is useful for someone.<br><br>Martin</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2009 at 23:00 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Martin, good thought on the Projects. I was a Things user until last month and wasn't sure how to make Things work with AutoFocus. My original thought was you could use tags "Page 1" "Page 2," etc., but your solution is much better. I've been using www.tadalist.com in conjunction with my IPhone today and so far I like it. I recently converted all my tasks to LifeBalance and I find myself longing for its goal-directed lists. However, I really like the sense of completion that is possible with AutoFocus. For now, I am going to keep assessing before making any decisions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2009 at 23:26 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel,<br><br>The tags approach strikes me as a good idea, too, now that you mention it – why do you think the Projects approach is better? I haven't tried thinking this through...maybe keeping an archive of dismissed tasks is easier on the Projects approach...?<br><br>Incidentally, I've just realised I was missing an obvious alternative solution to the items-per-page issue: you can just look at the bar which forms the bottom of the Things window and see an item count for the Project/page you're looking at – e.g., "1 completed, 9 remaining" (the current count on my last page). So all that stuff in my initial post about clicking back and forth to the Projects Focus was completely unnecessary. I'm tempted to quote Homer Simpson....<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2009 at 23:43 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Before you say, "Doh!" remember that it takes time to determine the best way to manage a new task system digitally! It took me a long time to get Things working for me with DIT. I imagine it will take time to refine this approach, too. I originally thought I liked the Project approach better than tags (I still do) because you can visually see the list of tasks per page without sorting. It seems like assigning tags to each task would be more time consuming than entering tasks per project, too. I didn't remember that Things had the feature of seeing the number of items completed/remaining per project or maybe that's a new feature? How are you liking 1.0?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2009 at 1:30 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't remember whether the feature in question was present in the beta versions of Things – I actually wasn't using the Projects area much with DIT. But I didn't do anything special to turn it on – it's just there now, at the bottom of the frame when I'm looking at a Project. (The corresponding text in the Inbox and Today areas, on the other hand, seems to just give the total number of items listed, regardless of their status.)<br><br>Things 1.0 seems to have a number of nice new features, whilst still retaining the simplicity that makes it so appealing to me. And the serious iPhone syncing problems I was having (involving information going missing on a sync) seem to have been resolved. There may be new problems there, though – at the moment I can't get syncing to go through at all!<br><br>Anyway, I could go on, but I imagine Mark would prefer it if I didn't turn this into a mini Things forum!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2009 at 2:32 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Martin &gt;&gt; It's also quick and easy to make a copy of a task and move it to the last page <br><br>How do you copy a task easily into Things ? Thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 2:14 | Tullio</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm another GTD to Autofocus convert and I use Things Touch exclusively (I don't have a Mac).  Here's my setup in case anyone is interested.<br><br>Since the screen only allows me to view 8 lines at a time and I don't want to continually remember how many items I have on a page the first thing I do in the morning is create a Project with the current date as the title (i.e., 2/17/2009).  This is the "active" page for the day.  Anything that I work on that doesn't get completed gets moved here (i.e., if I work on something from my 2/15 page and decide I'm good for now, I move it to the end of 2/17 simply by pressing the little arrow button at the bottom, selecting the task and then selecting the 2/17 page).<br><br>I deviate a little bit from AF to suit my own needs: to handle things that have to be done on a specific day, I file things in the "Scheduled" list and make use of the "Due date" field when appropriate.  I also have one tag called "Repeat" that I use for things that get done on some sort of repeated timeframe (i.e., take out the trash, make lunches, annoy the neighbors).  At the start of the day, I can go to my Logbook, filter on the Repeat tag and add them all to my new active page and then schedule or do whatever with them.<br><br>When a page is ready to be dismissed I just move the project into the "Someday" bucket and set myself a reminder to go back and check it in a week or so.<br><br>Works for me really well, so I thought I'd share.<br><br>-Pat</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2009 at 18:18 | Pat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm also using Tags instead of Projects for two reasons. It's easier to move an item to "other page" and you don't lost the capability to have Projects. Of course you loose Contexts in iPhone, at least until Things developers don't allow the option of filter by more than one tag like in Desktop version.<br>I think all reduces to choose what feature you don't miss, Contexts (just in iPhone) or Projects.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 February 2009 at 18:05 | Nahuel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Tullio (if you're still around): Sorry I didn't see your question earlier. All I meant was that it's easy to make a duplicate of a task that's already in Things – select the task and hit command D. Then you can check one copy off, and move the other to your last page.<br><br>Nahuel: I'm still using projects rather than tags, but mainly just because that's how I started doing it, and haven't felt a pressing need to change. I'm almost always working off my laptop, rather than my iPhone, so I don't run into the disadvantages you mention. It's true even on the laptop, though, that it would be nice if there were keyboard shortcuts for moving tasks between projects (=pages, for me).<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2009 at 22:26 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I know this is an older post, but I am contemplating using Things for AF. I have used it previously before discovering AF and then started working AF on the paper basis which has enabled me to get used to working with the system. Whilst it has been working very well, as I am a mac &amp; iphone user and have everything else (contacts, schedule, detailed project plans fully integrated), I am beginning to find it frustrating having to move around my note books as well. I use one for work and one for personal. I am not always desk based.<br><br>I'd be really interested in hearing how anyone is getting on using THINGS both iphone app and desktop, and any tips. I love AF, it has made a massive difference to my life, I also love using it paper based but practically, a mobile/IT based solution is going to work best for me in the long run. Incidentally one of my AF actions was "Thik about best way to work with AF" and today it stood out!!<br><br>Many thanks - Titch</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 May 2009 at 12:25 | titch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Titch, I tried Things for AF (have an IPhone and Mac) and I didn't like it. I DID really like it for DIT however. I am using Listomni. It's phenomenal! You can open and close any page (that are listed in order) on one screen. The only thing Listomni doesn't have is sync. You back up via email until their next build is ready this summer. I love that I can have separate grocery lists, movie lists, book lists, etc. all in the same app. To top it off, it's cheaper than Things by a long shot! (since you don't have to buy the desktop software, especially). My second favorite app after Listomni is Appigo ToDo syncing with Toodledo. Things is nice software, but it just doesn't work with AF that well IMO. Several people here are using The Hit List which looks very similar to Things. I don't think THL has an IPhone app though.

Anybody got that working?"<br>I did. I tried to do it. Here is how i did i keep my project and on the bottom of the project view I put page 1, page 2 and so. I was happy because on the task note i coud write what to do one after the other and make a link to the project. More I could give a context to each item and for a while i thought having found a way. But i was wrong. The link fell and there was no like with the project. So the view on OF was bad too. The resukt was better with Taskpaper. <br>Finaly i quit OF because paper is for me much more efficient and fast.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 May 2009 at 21:52 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have been testing AF in OmniFocus (which I prefer to Things for various reasons) in essentially the same way as I implemented DIT in OminFocus, see my post<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/682856#post705674">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/682856#post705674</a><br><br>For AF, each "Page" is just a different context in OmniFocus.

I was thus waiting to get all the wrinkles out before posting my set-up here, but from the hints that Mark Foster has dropped it sounds as if his new system will be more suitable for OmniFocus implementation and so I think I will now wait till that comes out before going digital.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 May 2009 at 15:55 | Jaroslav</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter/Jaroslav, thanks for your comments. I guess I'll continue using Moleskine based AF list for the moment. The problem is that even though I like having AF list on paper, it's not always practical to carry the Moleskine with me, where as I always have my iPhone available. Well, let's see if Mark's new system materialises and offers a solution that is a better fit for digital devices.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2009 at 7:38 | JMTee</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I used a full GTD set up combined with AF list at work, but quickly found I was compelled to stop outlining all my projects to reduce overhead.  I quickly switched to using an A4 pad and immediately gained about an hour a day I was spending outlining tasks / projects.  I now have switched to a simple pocket moleskine AF list which I photocopy every week as a back up, and havent felt any loss of control at losing GTD.   IMHO digital systems are OK, but as with everything else Keep It Short and SImple to be effective.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 May 2009 at 20:50 | Derek D</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Things isn't flexible enough for me. I've been using TaskPaper for a week, and have been able to customize it to the way I work. I especially like: the sidebar for juming to projects and topics; tags to quickly bring up, say, today's to-do list; indents for outlining (a major lack in Things); tabs for multiple viewing. And you can set your own font. In Things, I wound up keeping today's to-dos in a single window in a projects folder, and the type was a little small.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 May 2009 at 6:02 | ga</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"juming": jumping</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 May 2009 at 6:03 | ga</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Is there a Things version for the windows pc?<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 May 2009 at 8:08 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nope &amp; I don't think they'll try out that route.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 May 2009 at 8:20 | Stefano F.
