I identify my Most Important Tasks for this week/next week, and have a Must Do Today list if needed.

I tried the standard way &amp; liked it but am now experimenting with using it in my AF4 book by doing the 7 day &amp; one month cut-offs backwards. So far it seems to work. Carried forward tasks get a different bullet and they must be crossed off within 7 days. The balance must be done within a month. The advantage for me is that I can continue to use the same book for notes/journal entries, minutes etc, in addition to recording tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2010 at 4:06 | Geoff</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>DWM electronically on MLO, and I am surprised by the fit.

However, it's difficult to judge at this stage, and I feel that the true workings of DWM will only become clear once it's been used for several months.   I use paper, not electronics.  I can see the attraction, especially using a system like the one Andreas has come up with, but there's something special about using a notebook.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2010 at 10:16 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF4 tweaked with some of AF Revised.  Main tweak is going backward through the active list  and a similar handling of deletions.  But dominantly the AF4 approach.   I also recoil from having items spread out over 30 pages.  The major value of AF for me has been the concise listing of  issues that need working combined with a procedure that forces me to review them.   I have a career that is relatively "appointment" free (not totally).

I use columns to list the date of the entry and number each entry for tracking purposes. Another column, two grids wide is for noting who on my staff an item is delegated to (if I have to assign it more than twice, there's a problem). The next column is for placing an "X" to indicate completion of an item. The last column is a category column that I use single letter intitials to signify categories since I use batch processing in my assignments. Then comes the description of the item. 80% of this list is usually delegated. If I don't assign a category, the space is blank and means that it is something intended soley for me. <br><br>Each night I list my MIT's for the next day first, a la ZTD. then fill out the rest a la GSD.

Personal and work are mixed on the daily page and differentiated as a circle for personal and a square checkbox for work.  I start off the day on the daily page and will flip back and forth between the day book and the AF4 list as time and circumstances permit.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2010 at 5:04 | clay</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF2 (sort of) using Focuspad for iPhone and web. great because it is electronic but gives me the paper feel of "owning" the tasks and the idea of progress by it's closed list appeal...<br><br>Kai</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2010 at 6:49 | Kai</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Please count me in the ALBOE slot. <br>Using a jumbled mixture of AF4 and other methods.<br>Currently trying DWM at home.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2010 at 8:46 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sorry, forgot to write: On paper!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2010 at 8:50 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Clay wrote:<br>"AF4 in support of a DIT/ZTD/GSD hybrid."<br><br>Clay, is that Bill Westerman's GSD?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2010 at 9:37 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use a paperbased DWM solution</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2010 at 10:02 | Christian G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I didn't specify medium in my earlier post.<br><br>DWM with Current Initiative on paper.

I discovered that for me one of three things is usually the source of feeling overwhelmed:<br>1) Languishing tasks.<br>To keep the list fresh, dismiss a page once all its open tasks are over a month old. <br>2) Too many tasks.<br>To keep the list short, dismiss the oldest page if # open pages &gt; "x".  For me, critical mass at the moment is 7, so you can see why I didn't even give DWM a chance.

In general, my list consists of a few old pages with some lingering tasks, a few half-done middle pages, and one or two pages almost full of current entries.

Since I want to use the same pages for date-sensitive stuff (I know I won't trust a system that doesn't handle my calendar), renumbering won't work.  So when I have a break from the system, I intend to:<br>1) Go through and remove any pages before the current date that have no open items<br>2) Set "Day 7" and "Day 30" from the first day with tasks (which may be before current date)<br>3) Go through the lists and update any tasks that wound up getting done even w/out the system, reentering on new "day 7" as needed<br>4) Start using system with new "day 7/30"<br>5) As soon as the last item on a date before the current date is actioned, I will remove that page and change the "day 7/30" if needed<br><br>This should result in my being able to work through any backlog created by being away from the system without having to re-date pages, thus screwing up my calendar too.<br><br>If I actually have to use this tweak at some point, I can give an update about how it works.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 February 2010 at 19:16 | Jessica</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>DWM with current initiative and pulling out MIT's as I make the first pass through the diary.
