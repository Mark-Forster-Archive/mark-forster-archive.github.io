There's a reason there's no login at this site.  To me, anyone instructing me to send my email information with xy or z on the subject line sounds dangerously like spam potential to me.  I'd also like to point out that threads filled with email addresses are pretty useless to those checking in here for information, and further commentary on systems sent off the board by email is completely useless.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2010 at 2:44 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with TK, I thought the whole point of the forum was for sharing.<br><br>It feels like it's being offered to us then being taken away again, and I for one won't be handing out my e-mail address to every spammer in the world that's for sure.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2010 at 10:33 | Jack</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm with Steve on this issue of sharing methods.<br><br>I will be putting up something later which may only be of interest to some folk in the forum, and will use Dropbox public folder.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2010 at 10:45 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>RogerJ:<br><br>If you share the dropbox folder here, aren't you technically with TK on this one?

I still prefer public sharing though. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2010 at 10:58 | Ben</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; I don't quite get the "threads of email addesses" and "spammers" issues raised by TK and Jack &gt;&gt;<br><br>No, neither do I.

I don't know about you, but I'm just awash in SPAM from Mark.  I've got ONE email in my folders from him ... from a year ago ... a welcome email, if memory serves.

Still entering one's email address is voluntary, and I would have thought that, for people who don't know the site well, I would be far more likely to spam people than Peter would.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2010 at 15:48 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ben:<br><br>Yes, technically, but I'm with Steve re choosing the method of sharing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2010 at 16:00 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi all, I think I underestimated the power of curiosity! I made my initial post in response to Bruce partly because nobody had responded yet after two days and since I think the power of full engagement is an extremely valuable book I felt compelled to chime in. The book is not widely known, at least..., I rarely see people mention it. Because my personal approach lends itself really well to the power of full engagement I figured he might be interested.<br><br>I set up a google account to prevent spam (if anyone will get spam as a result it will be me), but I do agree that its nicer to have information shared. If there was private messaging I would have offered it that way because I didn't feel compelled to put it online at this time for various reasons. (Not that I'm vouching for a pm system.)<br><br>On a sidenote, for those that are apprehensive about sharing their emailaddress on the internet, if you have a gmail account, you can limit and track spam using the same method as I did by adding a + and some random text as an identifier to your email address. You can use the identifier as a filter and block future spam that way. <br><br>For those that thought they were getting a summary of the book 'the power of full engagement', sorry for the mishap, but this mindmap is insightful:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://bookvim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/the-power-of-full-engagement1.jpg">http://bookvim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/the-power-of-full-engagement1.jpg</a><br>as well as this amazon review:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3CMLEQ2T57">http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3CMLEQ2T57</a><br>and I think the cliff notes here are more extensive:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.philosophersnotes.com/titles/the-power-of-full-engagement">http://www.philosophersnotes.com/titles/the-power-of-full-engagement</a><br><br>(I'm not affiliated with those sites btw)<br><br>Thanks for the interest everyone!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2010 at 16:22 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Peter: Just to add my own appreciation for sharing your work here.
