This was something that I tried out during the development phase, but I never succeeded in overcoming certain problems. There were two main ones:<br><br>1) How do you know when to switch between AF1 and AF2 and back again? You could simply have them as options which you chose between as and when you feel like doing one rather than the other. But I would have preferred a more elegant solution - one which was built into the system itself, rather than depending on how you happen to feel at the time.<br><br>2) The other problem was how to overcome the disadvantages of AF1 mode, such as hit and miss dismissal, slowness of moving through the list, and difficulty of dealing with urgent items.<br><br>When I was doing the testing I never came to a satisfactory answer to these questions and in the end decided that the combination had no advantages over AF2 on its own. But as so often happens, I've just realised that something I thought of in order to solve a completely different problem has solved this one as well.<br><br>I had been thinking in terms of using the AF1 dismissal process, mainly because at that stage I hadn't developed the AF2 dismissal process. But it's just occurred to me that if I use the AF2 dismissal process the problem may well be solved.<br><br>So here's what I'm trying out (and you are welcome to join me but please bear in mind that it hasn't been tested yet):<br><br>1) "Change AF mode" becomes a recurring task on the list. You change from AF1 to AF2 or vice versa when the task stands out, and the task is then re-entered in the normal manner. When you change to AF1 mode you always start from the first active page.<br><br>2) The day starts in the way indicated for AF2 (drawing the line, dismissal if necessary, reading through the whole list). Then you continue in whichever mode you were in when you left off the previous day. To start off initially I recommend AF1 mode.<br><br>3) There is one very important amendment to AF1. There is no AF1 type dismissal. So if you do no tasks on a page you just move on to the next page.<br><br>What I am hoping is that this will improve the ability of AF2 to deal with tasks in the centre of the list, which is the main problem I think it has. It might also make it more tolerant of task dumping. If it works we will be one giant step nearer the perfect task management system!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 12:58 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>Ah, the elusive perfect system ;-)<br><br>You say: &gt;&gt;&gt; You could simply have them as options which you chose between as and when you feel like doing one rather than the other. But I would have preferred a more elegant solution - one which was built into the system itself, rather than depending on how you happen to feel at the time. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I would as well, however, as the "soul" of your system(s) is intuition, I don't see why working in a way determined by how you feel at the time is any real problem.  It kind of fits, in a fundamental way.<br><br>The "AF1 mode with AF2 dismissal" does seem to get around the problem of getting "stuck" at the end of the list.  AF1 guaranteed that you would always get around to every item in its turn.  Well, I suppose you could have so many new things going on that you could end up almost "thrashing" at the end of your list, but it seems less likely.<br><br>Has anyone considered (and possibly tested) a rule to work on ONLY one item per page and then move on?  That might really speed up the cycles.  Just a thought.  I'll put it on my list to test once I've worked your rules for a while.  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 13:10 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sounds interesting.<br><br>The birth of AF3, perhaps?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 13:20 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(Reposted from the other thread)<br><br>You could try treating your AF2 dismissed items as an AF1 list, following AF1 rules.<br><br>So there would be an AF2 section at the end of the list for day-to-day, and and AF1 section above that for longer term.<br><br>If an AF1 item is worked on it would then be added to the bottom of the list in the AF2 section.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 14:04 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Having tried my suggested combination for half a day I've already come to the conclusion that I don't like it. It is neither one thing nor another. So I'm going back to pure AF2.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 15:38 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting, Mark. I tried it for about an hour after reading your posting and really took a dislike to it so am also back on AF2, which feels so much more light and free than the combination approach.<br><br>At the moment, I am not having a problem with the tasks towards the middle of the AF2 list. I think the fear of missing something important keeps pulling me back towards that area fairly regularly for a quick scan of reassurance.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 15:54 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am doing an electronic version where newest items are at the top and using AF2 I work down the screen.  The closest that I could see, in my set up, to using a combination AF1 and AF2 would be the temptation at times to continue working down, item by item, rather than going back to the top (most recent) after every action.  Doing it electronically, down the screen, I would never want to work backwards at all.  I understand that in a notebook there is a natural desire to work front to back (left to right), so any combination of AF1 and AF2 would probably force the user to change directions (front to back; back to front).  I can't imagine that this would be very easy to learn if you were new to the whole AF system.  <br><br>Electronically, since you can work logically in one direction (down the screen), then the combination would simply be:  follow AF2 as long as there is pressure to do recent or urgent items, always returning to the newest (top) after each action, but when that pressure eases, then you can just work through the list item by item, but in the same direction.  But I am thinking I can live easily with just AF2 and go back to the newest items after each action (completed or partially done.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 16:12 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike most of the time I worked only one task per page on AF1. Trouble is even that didn't work as my list grew. I haven't been using AF2 very long but between its new dismissal rules and my new approach of keeping many individual tasks (books, blog post ideas, etc.) on associated lists I feel no anxiety whatsoever. I feel my work is completely under control and enjoyable too. One little perk of working electronically is I can delete blocks of completed tasks, only leaving one completed task in place to mark blocks of uncompleted tasks. It keeps the list shorter even though I can ignore all completed tasks while working by changing the view. Interestingly though I am finding that keeping the completed tasks visible is more motivating to me.<br><br>Time will tell Mark, but so far this seems like the perfect system for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 19:03 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm still trying a hybrid that works as follows:<br><br>- AF1 dismissal rules (which, I think, Mark should patent)<br><br>- AF1 is the "default" mode of processing<br><br>- Whenever you get that anxious / lost feeling because you just KNOW something urgent is buried in your list, and you have several things pressing on your mind but you can't work on them now because they are three pages ahead...  you know it's time to switch to AF2 mode.  So, you add a new task "Return to AF1 mode", jump to the last active page, and start working in AF2 mode.<br><br>- When I say "work in AF2 mode", here is what I mean:<br>     - Work through the tasks backwards till you find one that stands out.  <br>     - When you finish a task, start again on the last page, and work backwards again.<br>     - Do not do any "dismissing" when you are in AF2 mode.<br><br>- Eventually, things will calm down again, and "Return to AF1 mode" will stand out.  When that happens, just start working from the current page.  Optionally, you can start from the first active page; or read through all your tasks and then start from the first active page; or whatever.  But I like just starting from the current page.<br><br>I have always had a little plastic red sticky to mark my last page.  I now have two of them, one marked "AF1" and another marked "AF2".  I use the appropriate one, depending on what mode I'm in, so I don't forget and just go to what I'm used to (AF1).  <br><br>So far, I really like it.  I started in AF1, switched to AF2 for a bit, then back to AF1, and now am in AF2 mode.  <br><br>One thing I really like is that I can "hit the panic button" any time I want, and switch to AF2.  But I can't switch to AF1 until that particular task "stands out".  So it preserves some of the original AF psychology to help prompt when to switch, but also gives you a way out of an anxious situation.<br><br>YMMV, of course.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 19:07 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I too like the combined possibilities of AF1 and AF2.  My list has become a serpent.  I continuously feed the head ,  walk down along the body for some meat,  then run back to the head to see if it is still under control,  or continue up to the tail in AF1 mode.  The tail is burning away through AF2 dismission,  so once there I save some tasks or let them burn away to be free as a phoenix.  <br>OK, that being said, ... I will put 'visit a shrink' on my list.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 19:31 | Damien</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To be honest, I think the 'killer feature' of AF1 was the simplicity of the rules, which left you free to concentrate on the doing. The 'killer feature' of AF2 is, again, the simplicity of the rules. Trying to mix the two probably destroys the best feature of both, by over-complicating things.<br><br>At the moment I think the key benefit of AF2 over AF1 is the new dismissal rule - it's much less random, and less open to manipulation. My only issue with it is that I seem to have a lot of single tasks at the start of my list at the moment, so I'm a bit concerned that the dismissal 'sweep' isn't going to move through the list very quickly. I'm sticking with it 'as-is' for now; I'd be interested to know if that has ever been an issue for you in your testing, Mark?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 19:41 | Ed C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt; Trying to mix the two probably destroys the best feature of both, by over-complicating things.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Ditto.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 20:05 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ed C --<br><br>I have some of the same concerns that you do about speed of dismissal.  Under AF1, items stayed in my list for about 7-10 days before being either dismissed or done.  AF2 seems to be moving much slower than that.  I can almost still feel good about procrastinating about something for 7-10 days, but AF2 may let items drag on too long (for my comfort) before forcing the issue.<br><br>I'm not going to mess around with AF2 until it has had more of a chance to prove itself, but it should be easy to speed dismissal, if necessary.  One way would be to draw the line every day so it includes two blocks.  Or three blocks.  Or a whole page, if need be.<br><br>The trick is to match your dismissal rule to your input so that your list doesn't get too long on the one hand while ensuring you aren't having to revive item after item on the other.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 22:20 | Dan P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Frank wrote:<br><br>'The birth of AF3, perhaps?
