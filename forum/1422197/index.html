In principle there's no reason life or a job can't succeed in the above context, but SF would get unbalanced without a great deal of care.<br><br>One way to rebalance the system is to save SF usage for the free times, so you get smooth operation then until the next interruption.  The interruptions will slow progress in SF, but the system itself should remain in balance.<br><br>The other plan is to push hard to get interruption-free time.  I have a book or two on that theme.  If something does intrude your "focus time", note the issue and push it to the end of the list, or a separate list.  Maybe add one urgent item "look at the other list".<br><br>What do you think?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 14:27 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Alan: I agree, except it is very common with many of us on the forum!<br><br>I think a lot of the advice dished out by others, such as 'learn to say "no"' or 'be firm', or even 'schedule free time for yourself', depends on a lot of contextual factors. such as type of work, workplace environment, place in the hierarchy (official or real!).<br><br>Even a closed door with or without a Do Not Disturb notice (I've seen a few on office doors or cube farm walls) will not always work.<br><br>My current project team leader stays at home for the day or few hours if he wants to get interruption-free time, yet he is sometimes reluctant for me to try the same technique!<br><br>I've got a wandering mind that intrudes a lot of the time, so with SFv3 now, I put the issue with a R: which indicates a reminder or set a reminder in Outlook for a relevant time in the future at which point it comes back into SFv3 as a bona fide action task.<br><br>If it is an issue which does need to be tackled immediately after the end of free time, how about just prefixing with an asterisk in Column 2?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 15:14 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I dont want to be unpleasant or anything, but its pretty obvious to me that Seraphim spends most of his time interrupting himself.

I suggest you read some material about Myers-Briggs personality types,  take an online test (I suspect you might be something along the lines of ISTJ), then read some more about the different types. [I havent read a lot about MBTI and dont treat it as gospel, but then I am an ENFP (mostly), and understanding different personalities, and  empathy comes naturally to this type.] You will probably understand better how and why different people can have different problems with life and time management.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 17:08 | Daouda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This topic isn't about Seraphim.  It's about coming up with good and better ways to deal with lots of interruptions.  It's an important topic that when mastered can add many hours of productivity to the week, thus meriting a little time wrestling with it online.<br><br>So, any other ideas on how to address the issue?  Perhaps Roger is right that the solutions must depend hugely on the context?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 17:14 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So youre telling me Daouda that if I understood all that stuff you just quoted at me then Id know that some people CAN do lots of stuff they dont have to do and still have time for the stuff they do have to do?<br><br>Well can't chat any longer. Some of us have got work to do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 17:17 | Meryl</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nah. I like the way Seraphim is thinking about these things. He wants to run his system based on solid rules. The good thing about a system with solid rules is you can easily share the system with other people in a precise manner.<br><br>As it is right now, instead of having precise rules, I try to think about the system on two levels: 1) following the rules as written 2) thinking about what I want the outcome to be in deciding how to apply the rules.  I think it's part 2 that Seraphim objects to ("too much common sense").<br><br>Consider the example Mark Forster gave in one of his blog posts. He explained how he handled various types of tasks: put wash the dishes as urgent after a meal, put War and Peace permanently in column 2. You decide how to use the system BASED ON WHAT YOU WANT GET DONE not vice versa.<br><br>There aren't rules to tell you how to handle your tasks, just options. You decide the best option. I don't know if you can ever get away from that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 17:26 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>No Meryl, it's apparent you don't understand people. Some people wilt under the notion you propose that you must only do what must be done, until that's done.  Of course there is time in every life for stuff that must be done and also time for stuff that doesn't must be done. As an example, posting here can be valuable, but not a must.  Often there's time for that; sometimes there isn't.<br><br>Don, I agree with you.  I tend to think of SF by these abbreviated rules:<br>1. write new stuff last page, column 1.<br>2. anything you work on, if not done:<br>a) continue soon. reenter next page column 2<br>b), do more later. last page column 1.<br>3. each page, work at least 1 column 1, and all of column 2.<br>4. if something comes up <br>a) do it now<br>b) or enter this page (alternative: next page) column 2.<br><br>So it's all fairly mechanical with a simple choice at each point.  Do or do not; now or later.  <br><br>The full rules for SF say when and how to make these choices.  I take them to be suggestions rather than dictums. I take charge myself.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 17:59 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I knew it was a mistake to look back here, but here goes.<br><br>Alan I didn't say that you only have to do the stuff that has to be done. What I said was that if you insist on doing tons of stuff that doesnt have to be done then you cant be suprised if you bog down. And you and Daouda can quote all sorts of stuff at me about personalities but thats not going to change the basic fact of the situation.<br><br>Because the fact is that Seraphim has a problem with overload. And encouraging him to add to that problem is just irresponsible. Sorry to say it so bluntly but thats the way it is.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 18:15 | Meryl</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good answer.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 18:21 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Meryl, once again you fail to understand : nobody here really insists on "doing tons of stuff that doesnt have to be done"... We are just trying to do as much of these "optional stuff" as possible while still getting the "have to be done stuff" done. Because, to some people, this "optional stuff" can be the most important to them, or simply the spice of life, or whatever... And this is precisely why we need an "semi-automatic" system such as Mark's to help us in thos endeavour, if we only restricted ourselves to "have to's", a simple to-do list with no processing rules would do the trick.<br><br>I personally want (need) a system that lets me throw everything I WANT to do at it, "have to" along with "optional". The rules would then help me get the "have tos" done first and foremost, while still tackling the most important or realistic (at the moment) "optional" stuff. The "optional" stuff that isnt important realistic (yet) would then be dismissed,taken out of the system, and / or reconsidered later.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 18:30 | Daouda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is my expectation from Mark's system since he is the only one (that I know of) in the "time management gurus" circle to propose something that really seems able to accomplish this. GTD and its gazillion lists to be reviewed regularly just can't work for me. If anybody here knows of another system with minimal overhead that can be helpful with this, please let me know.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 18:49 | Daouda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Meryl - <br>&lt;&lt; I dont want to be unpleasant or anything &gt;&gt;<br><br>No unpleasantness detected.  :-)<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; but its pretty obvious to me that Seraphim spends most of his time interrupting himself. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Not when I'm following my list.

I just get a bit anxious when I find my list is growing without end, and I don't like getting into the habit of overriding the system rules with "common sense" because after doing that for awhile I find myself neither following the rules NOR following "common sense".<br><br>Plus, it's a welcome break to come here and chat about these things.   It's really fun seeing how Mark's systems provide so much help to people.   And it's really fun to stress-test those systems with my own huge number of tasks.   <br><br>As someone quoted in the blog comments:  &lt;&lt; Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex, intelligent behavior.  Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple, stupid behavior. &gt;&gt;    What a great quote!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 19:21 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan Baljeu wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; This topic isn't about Seraphim. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Alan, you burst my bubble!

I believe DWM2 is a bit better: as new and actioned tasks get mixed and give you the chance of breaking your working rhythm. I have been using them since they came up in this web site until SF was born. I was really fond of them.<br><br>Now I am a SF fan and don't think I want to come back to my DWM. SF fits my needs.<br><br>Nevertheless DWM time based dismissal will give you an efficient rule for your way of working (? guessing: lots of tasks, lots of ideas, lots of  "urgent" stuff). With DWM you won't need to make the dismissal choice, time will do it for you, which I think it is what you are looking for. <br><br>Yet you might try Mark's SF second and not fully successful version and tell us your experience (I see you are already doing). I hope yours and others' experience helps Mark not forget these two masterpiece tools of his creation.<br><br>Pacopepe</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2011 at 12:38 | paco_pepe</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It seems to me that one can combine time based dismissal with SF straightforwardly.

To go back to one of Mark's old systems may suit some people, but for me and many others here, SF is just better.<br><br>A daily list is simpler though, and it's a good idea for situations when there is a clear "must do", but not situations where oodles of must-do-sometime items exist.  A more intricate planning system could manage that okay, but SF also does so, and in a much more natural fashion (that is, more suited to human nature).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2011 at 14:48 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
