How long does it take to plan, write, record these weekly videos?  I expect it's a lot more than a written blog.<br><br>I'm just starting to watch these videos, and that's also a big effort.  The thing is you need to stop and think how to apply ideas to your own life if you want the value.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 September 2010 at 3:56 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Alan<br><br>Thanks for noticing :)<br>It takes about 6 - 8 hours total to do the research, brainstorm the synopsis, prep the prompter, film, edit and publish. You are right in saying that it probably takes more time then a written blog but I never did those so I couldn't say for sure. Fortunately, I know that if I spend about 2 blocs per day on it, I should get by for one video a week.....! (We'll see) One thing is certain though; I'm getting better at it and more comfortable in front of the camera so it's taking less time each time and the end result is nicer too I hope.<br><br>Thanks for watching by the way. I understand that especially in the first ones, there was a lot of stuff embedded in them. I also find that there is a kind of interaction that is needed from the part of the listener.<br><br>I don't believe there's a tool that will do everything for you automatically. The only thing we can do is understand the nature of time, attention and such and come up with our own solutions. I also think that most of the people coming up with systems are right in their own way so I try to incorporate their way of doing things at the best places in my Life Management. ex: Energy for Currency, Kanban for Flow and Pomodoros for Value Blocs, etc...<br><br>I try to give some of my ways of using that knowledge but then again, don't feel forced to follow them. But if you have specific questions about some of the ideas I talk about, feel free to ask or even try to get a conversation with me online on Skype for example. A few people did already :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 September 2010 at 8:21 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+AJPM+<br><br>&lt;&lt;I don't believe there's a tool that will do everything for you automatically.

I first tried to copy your own brand of time management, but I realized that my own circumstances and personality mean that I will not be able to.  So I shifted gears and just tried to take home what I could from your videos and applied them to my own TM.

So I started to break the series into smaller chunks and trickle them out.<br><br>You are right in assuming that the upcoming videos on the subject will cover the actual use of it (or at least that's what I'll try to do). The first one is only an entry into the topic and creating a level field where everybody can be somewhat clear about the topic, the vocabulary and the inherent differences in the subject matter.<br><br>But there is also something that I should point. It's that I don't give that many tactical advice (tricks you can actually do or use). I give some but I think I give more information about the nature of some of the stuff that comes up often in time and life management. Look behind what we believe is true and show it for what it is. From there, everyone can use their preferred system and put to use the knowledge they gained...

Could you provide the steps for the initial setup?<br><br>Thanks in advance</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 September 2010 at 17:01 | Jim James</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Jim<br><br>Hello Jim and thanks for the interest!<br>The first you should probably do is look at the video on My System:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/dhA1qB">http://bit.ly/dhA1qB</a><br>But I gather from your question that you probably already saw it and you are looking for more specifics on the implementation of it.<br><br><br>So, here is how to bootstrap in my "I" system:<br><br>1 - The very first thing you need to do is figure out how much time you usually have to manage each day. So take 24 hours and subtract the time you want to sleep, the time you take to eat comfortably and the time it takes for you to groom yourself each day. These are things you want to, should and have to do. What's left is the number of hours you have to manage.<br><br>2 - Take these hours and divide them by 2 to get the number of Pomodoros (or blocks) you get each day. And for every 4 put one aside for a big break. Just keep a total of the breaks to get an idea of how much slack time you'll have each day. But what we really need is those Blocks that are actually providing you value :)<br><br>3.1 - Then we start to budget. I figured that for me I had 21 blocks in a day putting aside all that I mentioned above. Your number will probably be different. I also have to point out that I am recovering from an illness so my budgeting is probably on the real safe side.<br><br>3.2 - Define broad categories of activities you do each day considering the type of energy you use to do them. I have these:<br>- Rest and Relaxation: Real relaxation where I take time to smell the roses if you will.<br>- Health and Exercise: Almost purely physical stuff because I have a limited amount of that.<br>- Creativity and Learning: Use of high mental energy and growing yourself (Projects)<br>- Maintenance and Review: Rolling the ball up the slope each day (not difficult but not inspiring)<br>- Fun and Entertainment: Escape from reality for a while.<br>To what you define as categories, add the "Miscellaneous" category because theres always stuff happening that you don't exactly know where it goes like transport or the like...<br><br>3.3 - Budget your blocs in those categories as you see fit but keep at least 3 blocks for "Misc."<br>If you want a template, here is mine and it works great for me. Feel free to tweak it as you see fit:<br>They are listed in the same order as above:<br>3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 3<br><br>4 - Create yourself a Kanban that can accommodate those blocks. You can see mine in my video.<br><br>5 - The first task you should assign is "System Review" as maintenance and use it each day, it will make sure you look at your stuff and Plan &amp; Review a little but also forces you not to take more then 30 minutes each day for that! Then start to populate as you work each day. You'll soon figure the stuff that comes back often and this is your Life Maintenance stuff (not to confound with Maintenance as a type of energy based task...). The rest are your Projects.<br><br>That's all I think you need for bootstrapping your system but if you have more specific questions, feel free to ask ;)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2010 at 1:00 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another benefit of using an entire Pomedoro for Plan and Review is you don't get to short-change it. It's very easy to "remember" what you need to do and tackle the loudest. It's like journalling or brainstorming -- the best stuff happens after the top-of-head stuff is done. It may not be necessary to do an entire Pom every day, but two or three times a week works for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2010 at 13:29 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>New Video Out: Rocks!<br><br>This video is the second in the series: "The Nature of Actions".

One needs strength to face the truth of anything and in return, you get even more strength. We also talk about the strength of one's convictions for example.<br><br>What's the difference with power?<br>It's kind of hard for me to put it into words but for me, there is a sense of status (to be / to have) in strength and there is a sense of potential (to use) in power. People can see and comment on your strength. It can even motivate or inspire them, but in the end, it affects you. Power is a force that is used by and against other or by and against one's self. Strength makes you solid, power makes things move...<br><br>I have no idea if I make sense but that's the way I see it.<br>Cheers!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 October 2010 at 9:33 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Um, a strong man and a powerful man are describing the same thing.

You should be doing the videos!<br><br><br>@Jupiter<br>Thanks for watching the video. You are right in saying that I took a lot of methods from other systems. I simply figured that everyone was right in saying that their system was the best. But it was the best in one area. I just apply their systems to the areas they are best for ;)<br><br>I'll try to answer your questions as clearly and succinctly as possible. I apologize in advance if I misunderstood something.<br><br>You are right, I have a lot of recurring tasks. I think that the video depicted those more then others because it was a weekend day for me.<br><br>Creating the system took me about a month of tergiversations after having read a lot and discovered this forum. Making it (the Kanban) took about 1 hour I would say. Erin can tell you how much it takes if you make it from scratch (get the materials and craft the notebook). Setting up the system took about 5 minutes since you just star using it and add stickers as you think of them.<br><br>Daily use of the system is no more then 30 minutes (1 pomodoro). It's actually a sticker. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes in the morning. Then 1 minute here and there to move stickers from time to time. And about 5 minutes at night for review. I have only seen one system with less overhead and it's Auto-Focus. And then again, with the cycling through pages, it's debatable... The video showed me using it a lot since I was demonstrating it.<br><br>As for projects I have quite a few. I'm presently taking care of my passport, my visa, creating my own company, a few customers with design projects, my website etc... I'd say about 15 projects that have multiple sub-projects. You can see the basic way of how I treat them in the video: "The I System". I basically have project plans and my tool of choice here is a mind map. There's a video about how I handle that coming up this year.<br><br>Other then that, I'm available to chat on Skype in French, English or Japanese.<br>I've already helped a few people get started with the system or projects they had.<br>I don't charge for it and you can schedule a time easily from here:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://tungle.me/sources">http://tungle.me/sources</a><br><br>Hope I helped somewhat :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2011 at 9:16 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Tergiversations????????</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2011 at 13:58 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's French for "Thinking".<br>Sorry, I mix the languages sometimes but I really thought that it is a proper word in English.
