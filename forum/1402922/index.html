If it was possible it would be the best but since I didn't find a practical way to do it I am trying now to use Taskpaper, creating a project for each page, inside which I create 2 projects, for left page and right page.

One was general list i guess and the other was urgent and unfinished. Taskpaper is great but the iphone app is medium it would be better on an ipad. You may use tags to such as keeping project and use @General  @urgent and unfinished but the result wil be tha you will not follow the rules ie not going to the next page until the current C2 is over. <br><br>May be it would be better to do it with a simple text editor such as macintosh page and 2 columns sync on your ipad, your iphone and your mac or more simple use google doc. <br><br>Of course I also like the iphone note app. Even if it is more difficult to cross tasks and i dont know how i could highline tasks. Any way for me it is much faster to do it on paper with a pocket note book using the left page for C1 and the right page for C2.

I can easily read about 20 lines on a sheet at a time on my iPod or any computer I might use Google Docs on, so I have "pages" of 20 entries each. <br><br>I set my column widths so I can see two columns at any time--this is the C1 &amp; C2 for a page. I put a header row in at the top to say Page1 1b Page 2 2b so I can keep track of what page I'm on. I scroll to the side to get to the next page--it's quicker than switching sheets, although that would work too.<br><br>When I work on a task, to mark it completed I change the alignment to Right Align (for some reason Office doesn't have strikethrough. Other spreadsheets might). If it wasn't completed &amp; needs to go into column 2 of the next page or if it's a recurring task that needs to go to the end of the list (eg the new daily habits I'm trying to form) I copy it (before I change the alignment) and paste it wherever it needs to go.<br><br>I use other pages when I have a project that requires more info (tasks that I don't want to forget but aren't ready to be done, my iPod book reading rotation (to mix fun and hard reading), etc...) Some of those pages are entered with project names in the SF3 list and I go to that page when I see the name and others serve as feeder lists.  I mark the column header of the page I'm on in bold since Office doesn't keep that steady if you switch sheets.<br><br>I haven't had to dismiss a page yet, but if I did I would change the fill of those two columns to some bright color.<br><br>One problem with working in Office on an iPod is trying to change large numbers of cells at once. Luckily, it's easy enough to switch over to Google Docs and do that type of editing there.<br><br>I'm at 5 active pages right now. 2 are down to less than 5 tasks in C1. I think that getting very many more might be difficult. I may wind up deleting all the completed tasks and consolidating my active columns at some point soon, just to avoid having 10 pages with most having less than a quarter of the tasks active. <br><br>So long as I follow the rules, this works much better than any other of Mark's systems that I've tried (before this, the best for me was DWM). The hard part, of course, is making myself follow the rules :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2011 at 18:35 | Jessica O</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I tried a setup in Evernote that put a 25x2 table on a page with spaces at the top to indicate when the page was opened, dismissed, and closed.  It was lovely, because Evernote lets you even put in tickboxes and everything.<br><br>But rich text Evernote notes are not editable in the iOS version of the app.  So that was a colossal failure.<br><br>In another thread, someone said that they had implemented it in Toodledo and just made column 1 tasks low priority and column 2 tasks medium priority.  That's how I'm doing it right now - I have a folder for each page (the only annoying part is that you have to manually keep track of how many total items are in the folder, there's nothing to  force you onto the next "page") and I sort first by priority and then by date added.  The flow isn't great but I'm getting used to it.

I was just using each day as a page, flagging each new task with deadline=today.  This made for variable-length pages.  I like your approach better.<br><br>Within each due-date group, I sort by priority, so all the column2 items are grouped together at the end.

I've been finding this to be a key dynamic in the paper-based version, but it's pretty difficult to implement.  You seem to be doing this with filters -- you keep a clean list with all your active tasks, and all the completed tasks hidden, as your default view (shown in your screenshot), but you have other filtered views to show you all the completed items or other pertinent data.
