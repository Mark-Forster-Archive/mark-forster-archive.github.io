I did not find it to have much to say in the way of actually comparing the two system, other than the last paragraph, which states:<br><br>"If you are working in a fast-paced work environment with constant new information and a stream of outstanding/delegated actions, then you will probably benefit from some form of GTD. If you want to commit to completing tasks and have instant feedback on your productivity levels and want something relatively easy to implement, then DIT is a good choice. However, if you are somewhere in the middle, combining the features that appeal to your situation can bring you DIT’s sense of accomplishment with GTD’s sense of control."<br><br>According to this analysis, there is some dimension which has GTD and DIT at opposite poles.<br><br>The GTD pole is characterized by four criteria: (a) fast-paced, (b) constant new information, (c) lots of outstanding or delegated tasks, and (d) complex implementation.<br><br>The DIT pole is characterized by three criteria: (a) completing tasks, (b) getting feedback on productivity, and (c) easy to implement.<br><br>I believe that the fundamental assertion that there is some dimension--with GTD and DIT at the poles--is incoherent. The only meaningful comparison is the statement that DIT is simpler than GTD. I would assume that anyone doing GTD would like to complete tasks, which is, supposedly, a DIT advantage. So anyone at the extreme GTD pole would also satisfy this DIT criterion. And it's easy to imagine a person who is at the DIT pole, meaning that she wants to complete tasks and get feedback on her productivity, also existing in a fast-paced environment, which is supposedly unique to GTD.<br><br>In summary, I believe that the article does provide a useful thumbnail summary of the two systems. I do not believe it provides a coherent comparison of the two systems. To do that, one would need to set up a series of criteria, and then examine how each system performs according to any specific criterion.<br><br>To kick things off, let me suggest some criteria that come immediately to mind: planning cycle, top-down or bottom-up, project or task orientation, organization, motivation.<br><br>1. Planning cycle<br>As I've written elsewhere on Mark's site, GTD's primary time unit is the week and DIT's is the day. GTD revolves around a weekly review. Each week, one sets aside time to examine one's commitments and update plans. DIT, in both its standard and revised incarnations requires daily (or close-to-daily) planning. What I have found is that GTD and DIT are compatible. My weekly review involves going through all of my planned commitments, while my will-do lists are refreshed daily.<br><br>2. Bottom-Up or Top-Down<br>Covey is an example of a Top-Down system. I find that both GTD and DIT are oriented much more heavily towards the Bottom-Up pole. They do not neglect setting audacious, large goals. But they both affirm, and I concur, that it is much easier to plan at higher levels when one has good control of the lower-level tasks and projects that one is committed to. It is very hard to plan big when one is overwhelmed by chaos.<br><br>3. Project or Task Orientation<br>I find that GTD is more project-oriented and DIT is more task-oriented. I suppose that both Mark Forster and David Allen might take issue with my assessment. Nonetheless, my experience has been that Mark's system has increased my effectiveness significantly by getting me to focus with great intensity on the most finely grained aspects of my work. For example, his Little and Often principle empowers me to get started on the most audacious goal by taking a sheet of paper out of a file folder. David Allen's system stresses keeping very thorough documentation that answers the question, "What is the desired outcome?" Keeping this detailed project list enables me to keep my focus on what it is that I am trying to accmplish.<br><br>4. Organization<br>GTD spends a whole lot of time and energy on maintaining an organized system. DIT does not. That is why GTD is often characterized as being highly complex and DIT simple. GTD has this "trusted system" which contains detailed lists of one's commitments. Given that my life is highly complex, I appreciate having this organizational system to keep me on track. The core of DIT is the will-do list. It is simple.<br><br>4. Motivation<br>I think that if GTD shines along the organizational dimension, DIT shines along the motivational or executional dimension. As others have said before, GTD is really about Getting Things Organized. DIT is really about Getting Things Done. I started truly getting much more done, once I started doing DIT. DIT uses very powerful, cognitive and behavioral psychological methods that turbocharge the productivity of those who suffer from procrastination and other productivity-draining problems.<br><br>If one performs exacting hermeneutical analyses, one can find incompatibilities between GTD and DIT. But I believe that such exercises are misguided.<br><br>David, I am curious to hear you views.<br><br>moises</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2008 at 21:29 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi moises,<br><br>This is an excellent as usual view of the two systems.  Both GTD and DIT have considerable strengths.  I only have a little to say beyond your excellent analysis.  First, I agree with the GTD focus on the week.  I still do this in my system as I think it is important to conduct a weekly review to see where one is with things, what new things have come up, and as is a hallmark of GTD -- to move from the runway all the way up the to the meaing of life and major goal level.  Asking the question simply: "Am I where I want to be?  What do I need to do to keep my focus?"<br><br>Now, with that said, I have found DIT to be far superior at the runway level and managing the onslaught of tasks coming my way -- AND -- not to lose my focus!  It is so simple in implementation, but so very powerful in how it really works!<br><br>So...I use aspects of GTD in my collection and processing....and weekly review....and someday/maybe list....but the main part -- by far -- of my work management system is DIT!<br><br>Best wishes.<br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 December 2008 at 20:26 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the useful summing up of the article's findings. I was going to write a reply to the article, as I announced a week or so ago, but since then I have been developing a new system which looks like it will work better than either DIT or GTD and remove most of the problems associated with choosing betwen them. This still needs testing fully but it looks set to render anything I might say obsolete. So watch out for developments!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 December 2008 at 15:26 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
