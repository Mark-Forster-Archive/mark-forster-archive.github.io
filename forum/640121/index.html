Obviously, I can just sit down and read  the book--nothing else is pressing, and it's the time of the night when "relaxing" is the only agenda item anyway.<br><br>BUT--<br><br>I can't escape the nagging feeling that I should be doing this "task" from my AF list.<br><br>So my questions are:<br><br>Would you even put "relax and read book" on your list?<br><br>If so, what do you do when you want to sit down and relax but that item is 4 pages away?<br><br>Does anyway else feel so caught up with AF that it's hard to stop, so NOT working from the list (even during the relax time) feels somehow negligent???<br><br>ds</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2009 at 0:06 | ds</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To your query, I would have to ask: who's in charge of your time and energy? You or your AF list?<br><br>The AF list is a tool, and a very useful tool, but a tool that goes into the drawer when I'm done with it or don't need it.<br><br>But yes, I do have "read a chapter", "read a comic," "watch a Dr Who on Netflix", stuff like that (we'll take it as a given that these are relaxing activities :) <br><br>Doesn't matter if it's 4 pages away or not. If I'm tired and ready to relax, I'll do it. I know there are lots of tasks left to do on my lists, but I have to call it a night sometime!<br><br>Sorry if I misinterpreted your post. It appears the AF method has been working for you, so that's great. I would recast your problem as one that writers have: do they still keep writing when they're feeling hot, or do they do as Hemingway advised and stop in the middle of a sentence, so you can pick up where you left off the next morning? The latter method -- finishing the work day before your tank is empty -- leaves you primed for the next day. (Some of the productivity mavens call this "parking on the downhill side.")<br><br>Sounds like you're leaving yourself enough energy and interest to start off your next AF session with gusto. So I wouldn't worry about it. If there's a task that's *really* important, it'll make itself known.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2009 at 3:10 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I love seeing how AF automatically gravitates towards what's most important, and helps me overcome artificially/psychologically induced resistance and stress (as opposed to stress because you REALLY have to get something done right now!).<br><br>For example, I was really feeling nervous about a certain deadline-driven task today -- really feeling some pressure -- but it was a kind of "external" pressure -- not the "standing out" kind of feeling.  So I just said to myself, let's skip that item, you can't concentrate on it because you're so stressed about it, and just go do something more fun.  And so I did.  And then I realized that the stress I was feeling was really just nervous pressure, and had no real basis.  Nobody needs me to do that task right now.  I still have plenty of time before the deadline.  So, I was very glad I just followed the AF system.  It made me realize how much these feelings of stress can be purely psychological.<br><br>My whole point is that AF helps you to sort out all those those nagging thoughts, pestering "I really should be..." thoughts, etc.  The psychology of this method is really quite fascinating.<br><br>So, ... back to your point about doing something you just *want* to do.  Personally, I'd throw the book on my AF list, and let the list help me figure out why the question makes me feel so stressed out.  Maybe there is something else your unconscious mind is prompting you to do instead, something else that's really more important.  And then, when the book "stands out", I'd spend some time reading it!<br><br>Not that this is the only answer!  It's just what I would do myself, and I'm sure you'll get lots of good suggestions!  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2009 at 3:56 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ds:<br><br>Valuable replies from Mike and Seraphim. I'll just add that personally I do put all my leisure activities on AF as well as the chores, so I've got items like "Read Greenmantle", Watch "Oz &amp; James", "Go for walk". That has actually made my leisure time much more purposeful. <br><br>But if it's near the end of the day, I will often put the list away and just do whatever I feel like doing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2009 at 23:44 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the very helpful replies.<br><br>Partly my query was genuine "what are the nuts and bolts of the system", and partly just pondering over the effect of using AutoFocus.<br><br>Obviously, I can read a book before bed if I want to, but for me, as for many posters here, using AF has made a big change in my thinking about ALL my tasks, and I was thinking out loud a bit, and using (abusing?) this forum to see what others thought.<br><br>So thanks!<br><br>ds</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2009 at 1:29 | ds</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm glad people are posting their thoughts freely, there are very interesting things being written in the discussion forum.

I don't have the same sense of "ought to" with AF that I had about my tasks before AF - working on my lists is actually an enjoyable experience (something I am still getting my head around in many ways because it seems so odd to be enjoying doing half the stuff on my lists).  <br><br>Interestingly, I was away for the weekend and, despite the fact that I know I have deadlines to meet this week, I was so much more relaxed than I would normally be - normal for me would be worrying about all the stuff that I have to do. That just did not happen, and I'm looking forward to getting back to my lists tomorrow.  <br><br>Looking forward to Monday ooo-er!<br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2009 at 23:18 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim<br><br>Your comments re nervous pressure are really helpful - gives a really good explanation of the difference between external and internal pressures.

Yes, I have "read my book" on the list. All day long, that task has not "stood out" to me.<br><br>Now, it's eventide. Is it "fair" for me to skip all the other items on my list, saying that they don't stand out, because I'm sleepy, I want to relax, all I really want to do is read my book, and--hey! there it is on my list!<br><br>Or is that circumventing the system and choosing what I already knew I wanted to do anyway?<br><br>(The book is an example; I find this sort of thinking has applied in other situations, too).<br><br>Any thoughts?<br><br>ds</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2009 at 2:56 | ds</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would say it's not just standing out, it's calling you from across the room.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2009 at 5:35 | Rick</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with Rick.
