I will give you the specifics, but I know there are quite a few tasks that are similar. Wondering what Mark and others have to say. <br><br>My goal for this year was to spend 1/2 hour of "special time" a week with each of my children. I have this time scheduled. One would think I wouldn't resist it, but I do. I let me children choose what they'd like to do during this time, so I know I may be spending half an hour playing Candyland. Ugh. LOL I often try to get the kids to do something with me that I enjoy doing or need to do, but it's usually to no avail. I've tried changing the way I think about this time (e.g., how blessed I am that my children want to spend time with me), but usually I resist and avoid the time anyway.<br><br>I just added each child's special time to my AF list two days ago. The kids aren't happy. LOL I think it may very well break down my resistance. BUT I can't very well "Just get the board game out" with my kids. They will mutiny! It's true that I could do less than 30 minutes, but not much or again the kids will complain. It seems to me that there are other tasks like this: all or nothing. <br><br>I am open to suggestions on how to manage these times with my kids that in my heart of hearts I really DO want to do. But the way it's structured now, I feel much resistance to it. I've skipped it twice on my AF list now and feel a lot of guilt.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 16:07 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel<br><br>One of things I'm finding is that it is the scheduling aspect of tasks that can cause me an issue.  I have found tasks that I want to do, that I enjoy doing, having resistance simply because of the fact that I have scheduled "a time to do them".  Obviously I don't know what ages your children are or how practical it would be but could you perhaps make a game of it that they will have their time each week but that the time will just "pop up" at varying times during the week?  <br><br>There will be a reason and as it is clearly not the task itself just take some time to look at the other factors (time of scheduling, lack of control as the children choose the activity, wanting to be doing something else at that particular time etc.) <br><br>Congratulations by the way on readjusting your AF system - I tried playing with different things but they all increased resistance in some way or other.  I think it is a healthy part of the learning curve to try other things - it makes us see how good the system really is - and that sense of relief on homecoming is pretty cool!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 16:19 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel<br>I'm no expert, but being a member of a large family, we learned early on the concept of taking turns.  Why do they get to choose every time.  In my house, it would either be negotiated or alternated.  Also, you'd be teaching them an important social skill.  The half hour belongs to both of you, not only the child.  At worst, you'd only be resisting half of the appointments!  LOL!<br>Maybe you and each child can draw up lists that you both agree on and use it when necessary!  Otherwise, teach them normal social negotiation skills(example: deciding on a movie) or learning how to make the best of an activity when it's not your turn to choose!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 16:26 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.  If there's an arguement over who's turn it is.........toss a coin!  LOL!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 16:31 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You don't mention how you've phrased the 'task' but I'm imagining "Spend 30 minutes with Dolly." Maybe that's too specific. Maybe just "Kids?" or "Dolly?" with the question mark there so that your mind inquires what needs to be done now with the kids or with Dolly. <br><br>That said, maybe when you see the task in your AF list you just close the book and forget about the AF list for a while. As important as many of the tasks in our books may be, in the end, they're just chores and tasks and errands, and how much time do we *really* want to spend thinking about them?.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 16:35 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I certainly wouldn't put "Spend 30 minutes with Dolly" as a task on AF. It's not designed for that type of activity.<br><br>I would suggest that the following *would* be examples of suitable tasks:<br><br>Arrange time with Dolly<br>Plan time with Dolly<br>Ask Dolly what she would like to do at the weekend</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 18:30 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the feedback. I appreciate it! The way it works is I have time scheduled for each child a different day of the week (I have 6 kids). So I'm not needing to put "plan time" on my AF lists. I do think I could do more negotiating on what we actually do during special time. That could help. Sometimes I wonder if expecting myself to have 3 hours of special time a week on top of everything else I do just isn't realistic. Then again, this time counts a lot more in the long run than most of the tasks on my AF list. I probably just need to decide to be committed to it like I am to exercise. I'll let you know if I find a solution.<br><br>As an aside, I do think AF can work for some tasks like this. When I mop my kitchen floor (on the list), I'm not going to mop a tiny section. I know going into it that's a 20-minute task, but AF helps me get it done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 22:05 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel,<br>It may be that deep down you realize that 3 hrs is not realistic at this time for you. And that may create lots of resistance. So, may be you start out small and work yourself up to higher frequency. So, you could start out with twice a week (2 kids a week). Over time, as you all get comfortable with this you could increase it to cover more kids.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2009 at 0:27 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel, I can totally understand your struggles here!  We also have six children, including one set of twin boys.  We learned pretty quickly that this particular set of twin boys really likes doing everything together -- they feel like their brother is missing out if I do something with them just 1-on-1.  So, I usually (but not always) have that "special time" with them together.  <br><br>And that led to mixing up the special time quite a bit for everyone else, too, so that sometimes it's 1-on-1, and sometimes there's two or three of them.  Sometimes it's just going for a drive to the hardware store or something.  We can talk or listen to an interesting podcast and talk about it (Discovery Channel has some great audio podcasts).  Or maybe it's just sit and read with the 4-year-old for 10 minutes during a break from work (when I'm working from home).  Or showing the 8-year-old how to rotate the sprinkler so all the grass gets covered.  Or maybe playing a board game (but the twins like the complex ones, like Settlers of Catan, so it's pretty hard fitting it in sometimes!).  Or maybe just going for a short walk together.<br><br>So, I do have "spend time with X" on my list, but I leave it open-ended -- maybe we'll do something like I listed above, which is usually somewhat spontaneous.  But maybe we'll block out some time on the weekend to do something that takes more time.  And maybe we'll include some of the others, and maybe even my wife.   :-)   (She spends most of the day with them, so it's not like she needs to work more opportunities into her schedule...)<br><br>This arrangement seems to work OK.  I still wish I had more time for them all.   But at least the feeling of being "connected" with each one individually is maintained.<br><br>One more thing -- putting it on the AF list and keeping it somewhat spontaneous allows me to adjust to the changing needs of the children.  Sometimes the four-year-old needs some extra doses of attention, several times during the week, or even several times (in small doses) during a single day.  On the other hand, the 13-year-old is more independent, and as long as we have a chance for a long talk now and then (usually when we're taking a longer drive), she's OK.  And sometimes it changes around, depending on circumstances.  Using AF for this allows you to be guided by your intuition, rather than just following an arbitrary schedule.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2009 at 15:28 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel,<br><br>I can't speak for Mark, but whan I read "Plan time with Dolly", I did not understand that to mean just "schedule in the Dolly appointment".  I understood it to mean "Plan what Dolly and I will do together".<br><br>I don't have as many kids as you.  But for what it's worth, I would never tell my child I will do whatever you want.  I tell my child our shared activities have to be something we will both enjoy, so we work together at identifying what that is.<br><br>That might be an entry for your AF list... Discuss with Dolly to identify mutually attractive activities.  Should occupy one of your 30-minute slots! :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2009 at 18:41 | Steve Schapel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Steve &amp; Seraphim, thanks so much for your comments. I talked with the oldest kids and my husband about it and feel I have an answer for now. My husband just spends time with the kids whenever, wherever and does a great job at it, too. I am home with them all day and in order to get our schooling done, I have to have a schedule. The school schedule actually works well for me. Scheduled special time does not. I am going to leave "spend time with ___" for each of my children on my AF list and see what happens. If it doesn't happen, I'm not going to sweat it and I'll dismiss them. The truth is I spend individual time with ALL my children. I talk with them on drives one-on-one, take them on errands, read to them alone, play with them individually, and also in small groups, BUT I don't get credit for it. I think that's why it's become so high resistance for me. When I do make the time for one, they all start clamoring for their time. If I miss one child's day, I'm suddenly faced with an hour of special time the next day to get caught up. I'm just going to let go of the schedule and see what happens.  <br><br>I so appreciate everyone's feedback. This has been an issue that has bothered me for ages. I feel a huge sense of relief in letting go of this giant "should." I wouldn't be surprised at all if I suddenly found myself playing Candyland for LONGER than half an hour. Well, that might be going too far. I'll still probably stack the deck to speed it up. LOL</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2009 at 20:17 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel:<br><br>Steve is right about what I meant. "Plan time with Dolly" was intended to mean plan what Dolly and me will do together.<br><br>I think we parents all tend to get a bit misled by the fashionable talk about "quality time" - that we have to be doing something special with the children all the time. I suspect what children actually want is "quantity time" - the feeling that their parents are around for them if and when they need them. It sounds as if you're already giving them plenty of that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2009 at 21:52 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
