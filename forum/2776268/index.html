All the most inefficient workers I've known (sadly including myself at times) have worked on the basic principle of "Do Everything At The Last Minute".<br><br>Apart from anything else "Do Everything As Soon As You Can" will make it much easier to identify when you have too much work.<br><br>Yes, I do think that as far as possible (important proviso) one should aim to work on everything every day. The reason is that "little and often" is the most efficient, effective and stress-free way of working. In fact with many tasks, it's most efficient to work on them more than once a day. This is the way to keep to "in-box zero". <br><br>To take a literal in-box, your email, compare the extremes. What would happen if you visit your in-box multiple times a day and ensure that each time your email is cleared? What would happen if you let your email accumulate for a week, and then have to clear it all in one session?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 November 2020 at 9:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I do have tasks, like mopping the floor and doing the groceries, that I want to do as less as possible.

I'm talking about "cost" in the widest sense, not just money.<br><br>So, to take groceries as an example, to stock up on groceries involves travel, car parking, walking round the aisles, queueing at the cash desk, and so on. You can reduce these costs by reducing the number of grocery shopping expeditions you do. <br><br>On the other hand, if you only shop occasionally you may run out of storage space, and you may have to do supplementary visits to the shops to buy some items which run out. Plus when you do get round to shopping, the extra effort involved may result in you putting it off.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 November 2020 at 15:50 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think I am most effective when I work on everything every day. But let me clarify what I mean by "everything".<br><br>I put things like "mopping" into a recurring tasks list in Outlook. It would be set up to recur automatically one week after it was last completed, for example. Other tasks might recur every other day, or every month, every quarter, etc.<br><br>The one recurring task I actually do try to complete every day is to clear the Outlook task list. If I stay on top of that, then I am getting "everything" done and staying on top of my work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 November 2020 at 2:43 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Mark &amp; Seraphim for your help!<br><br>Since these "do not want" tasks are just a few, I just scheduled them out akin to what Seraphim describes. The "philosophical stance" is of course provided by what Mark wrote above.<br><br>The rest gets cleared daily. The feeling is just too good. I worked on things with at times hilariously menial amounts per day, but the priority is the daily clearance. So far, so good.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 November 2020 at 9:49 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, you said "Apart from anything else "Do Everything As Soon As You Can" will make it much easier to identify when you have too much work."  I guess the solution to this then is to either make more time for yourself (pretty limited on that option), or to swiftly delete tasks that just aren't moving along.  Is this true?  Unfortunately my long list is still a little bit of a someday/maybe combined with current things, but I'm just not getting to many of them.  Thanks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 November 2020 at 21:30 | Cameron</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cameron:<br><br>&lt;&lt; to swiftly delete tasks that just aren't moving along. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes and no. It's certainly important to delete stuff that's going nowhere. But it's also important to ask yourself why you have stuff on your list in the first place which is going nowhere. If you can afford for it to go nowhere, why did you take it on? And if you can't afford for it to go nowhere, then why aren't you adequately staffed to deal with it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 November 2020 at 1:33 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To force myself to work on everything everyday has proven to be an eye opener! <br><br>I thought I was quite slim with my workload and guarding my commitments inventory well. Not so. It showed that improvement was possible and necessary.<br><br>Prune your commitments!

I re-introduced the CI from DIT and also the list of future CI. This serves as a way to ease the load on the FVP list and also to show me quite well how stupid my ideas are.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 November 2020 at 7:31 | Christopher</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
