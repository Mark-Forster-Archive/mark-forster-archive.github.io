I suffered from languishing middle pages, probably not as badly as folks with longer lists, but I still suffered from them.  More than that, though, the dismissal procedure simply didn't work for me.  I think that if my working circumstances were completely predictable it would be ok, but for the bulk of the time that I was using RAF, I was doing the at-home-mom routine (which is not my norm) and my discretionary time for the sort of tasks that I put on my AF list varied from a couple of hours a day to a couple of minutes a day.  Having a time-based dismissal procedure at that time, honestly, meant that I abandoned dismissal altogether because I would have ended up dismissing truly important things that my childcare situation had simply prevented me from acting on!<br><br>But AF4.  AF4 is like a dream.  I love the combination of closed and open lists.  My previous concerns about how intuition would work with the open list have receded as I have used the system more.  (At the time that I had those concerns, I hadn't yet triggered a review of the closed list.)  I am getting a good mix of urgent and less-urgent, work and personal tasks done every day, with remarkably little resistance.  Unlike some others, I like the short-term review of items rather than letting tasks sit there highlighted for weeks or months.  (In previous versions, I always had "enter reminder into calendar at a more appropriate time" as one of my options during review - basically turning my calendar into a tickler file.)  Now I either delete things entirely, rephrase and re-enter, or continue use my calendar as a tickler file.<br><br>As I mentioned elsewhere, I haven't been tracking how often I draw a new line, but it's roughly 2x/week.  (I think I'll start noting how long they stay as closed lists just for curiosity's sake.)  I have a mix of closed lists that have been completed and ones that have been reviewed - when I have reviewed there have been as few as 6 and as many as 17 un-actioned tasks on the list at the time of review.  The numbers of reviewed items have been going down as I have worked with AF4 longer but we'll see what happens long-term.<br><br>In short, well-done Mark, and thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2009 at 22:29 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I concur.  This one really hits the sweet spot for me.  My list is now shorter than ever before because I'm getting more done and/or dismissing this more quickly and staying focused on the priorities.  Great stuff, as usual.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 September 2009 at 22:49 | Jim (Atlanta)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I also concur with Sarah. For the first time, for me, everything is getting some attention within, at most, a week. My line moves forward about twice a week. Sometimes the Closed, sometimes the Open, predominates, but usually I switch between them once or twice a day.<br><br>For me, a lifelong geek, it was also, I think, very important that I switched to pen and paper - I use an A7 notebook which is with me everywhere. For some fleeting ideas and notes, a PDA is, in truth, too slow. This was not something I wanted to see, but I needed to see and act on it to enable AF4 work well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 September 2009 at 6:30 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well said, Sarah! My line has been moving about once a week. But the best thing is that I cycle through my list at least twice a day, no matter how little time I have. I could only see my entire list once a day in AF1 and never got through it with AF2-RAF. This means AF4 has changed my approach to the concept of little and often --- meaning now I can do a little of something and be sure it will come up again later in the day if I want to tackle it again!<br><br>The only problem now is that my list is getting too short. :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2009 at 22:48 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree that Autofocus 4 is phenomenal. As a pastor, with numerous tasks and reoccurring tasks I find it works perfectly for me. I worked really hard at using it according to the rules today, and I was absolutely amazed at the amount of work I got finished. So far, I am definitely sold on the system. Way to go Mark!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 October 2009 at 3:55 | Pastor Chris</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
