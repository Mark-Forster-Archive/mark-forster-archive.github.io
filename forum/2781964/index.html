It has taken me many years of experimentation and dead ends to appreciate the following: My ability to get things done is related to two things: <br><br>1. A relationship<br>2. Hard landscape appointments/deadlines<br><br>1. I have a full private practice with a waitlist. The hard landscape i.e. booked therapy appointments and costs of not showing up (ouch) gets s**t done.<br><br>2. My podcast - Pop Parenting - is almost a year old. We're currently ranked #21 on the most listened to Jewish podcasts of 2020-2021. The key variable: my relationship with my co-producer.  We have fun... and fun translates into hours of research and commitment to producing one show per week. No lists. No rules. No special paper or software. <br><br>3. My books were a combination of hard landscape (contract with publisher) and relationship (co-author with wife (book #2) and my late therapist (book #3)<br><br>etc<br>etc<br><br>All this to say, I agree with Snell. It's a good place to be in.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2021 at 15:32 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark's criteria seem overly prescriptive to my mind.  I hereby amend, item for item, as I see it:<br><br>It must capture everything that needs doing<br>It must be capable of being run simply<br>The system must always give you quick access to any task.<br>It must keep the whole workload under review.<br>Scanning must be short and easy<br>There must be no compulsion to do any task at any time<br>The process should not inhibit the flow of thought by difficult rules or selection criteria.<br>** It must direct your action efficiently to tasks that matter now.<br>&lt;Does any system force you to scan the same list multiple times without doing a thing?&gt;<br><br>I made these amendments because I didn't find your list agreed with my ideal, and I didn't see any reason why your ideal should be excluded from possibly being an ideal system.<br><br>I think there are existing systems that may fit these criteria, though it's particular to the individual whether a given system succeeds.  In particular, the ** criterion will have the same system succeed or fail for different people who have different patterns of working.  (The system I'm operating now seems close to meeting these for me, and especially **, but it doesn't aim for Mark's feature list.)<br><br>Avrum: That's a very interesting approach.  Instead of a mechanical system, an interpersonal system for ensuring things get done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2021 at 15:56 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Simple Scanning certainly seems to come very close to fulfilling your criteria of a perfect system above. To me, those criteria almost read like a description of Simple Scanning! Indeed, up until now, I've considered it the best task management system. Though I continue to try new things.<br><br>While those are compelling criteria, Alan has a point about them being somewhat prescriptive. (Alan's amendments are interesting.) Perhaps it would be good if ALL systems had a chance in the running for "perfect system"--including "no list" systems, etc.? Saying that "it must be a long-list system" seems to narrow the range of possibilities.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2021 at 16:28 | Belacqua</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very interesting discussion. It has triggered many thoughts on what I want from my time management. It boils down to this:<br><br>(A) I always have a clear idea of what I need to be doing and am able to do it easily. If I need to make a decision what to do, the decision is clear, fast, and easy. <br><br>(B) I am more and more satisfied with the results I am getting.<br><br>(C) When I encounter obstacles or deficiencies with either A or B, I identify the situation quickly and have a straightforward, reliable process to create a new A and B. <br><br><br>Maybe A represents Flow, B represents Throughput or generation of value, and C represents Improvement.<br><br>Now that I think about it, I suppose this is what I want from *any* system -- it works without any fuss, it generates the value for which it is intended, and when something goes wrong, that fact becomes clear right away, and there is a clear direction for resolving the situation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 April 2021 at 18:09 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Belacqua:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Perhaps it would be good if ALL systems had a chance in the running for "perfect system" &gt;&gt;<br><br>I emphasize that it is a list of what *I* would like to see in a perfect system, and my conclusion is that there is no existing system which meet all my criteria, and probably never could be. <br><br>As you say Simple Scanning meets many of the criteria, but I don't find it lightning fast, and my ideal system has to have that quality.<br><br>So the real problem is that my definition is actually self-contradictory.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2021 at 9:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; it works without any fuss, it generates the value for which it is intended, and when something goes wrong, that fact becomes clear right away, and there is a clear direction for resolving the situation. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, those are all good points in what we are looking for in the "perfect" system.

For me, Simple Scanning is lightning fast. But then, I tend to keep my list pretty short.<br><br>On the perennial topic of the best system, I recently read Mark's 2016 blog series on "what type of system... would win the evolutionary stakes." <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/1/25/types-of-lists-i-the-catch-all-list.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/1/25/types-of-lists-i-the-catch-all-list.html</a><br><br>Fascinating reading (even if it's a few years old). I was struck by the fact that even "using no list at all" came in for consideration as a contender. It takes humility and open-mindedness to entertain that possibility when you've spent years creating list-based systems! The positive verdict on "no-list" systems in the 2016 series was one thing that convinced me to give them a (belated) try. Though I haven't gotten around to doing an extended trial yet.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2021 at 16:12 | Belacqua</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>P.S. <br><br>On the criteria of an ideal system: I suppose one possible addition would be "fun to use." (Granted, that's going to be subjective.)<br><br>Indeed, even a less-than-perfect system can probably produce good results if one enjoys using it and sticks to it. Previously, Mark has written persuasively on the virtues of sticking to one system. Which can be tough to do given the abundance of exciting ideas on this website!<br><br>As an example of what I mean: AF1 was a great system but perhaps it wasn't perfect. Yet I have fond memories of using it some years ago. And I used it for a good stretch of time.

I do believe an ideal system must not be a chore to use.  If the process makes you feel like quitting, or not picking it up again the next time, that's not a good process.  So maybe an ideal process entices you to use it and feels rewarding when you do.  AF4 was a good example of that at times.
