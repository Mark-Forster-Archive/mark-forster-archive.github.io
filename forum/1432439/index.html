You could however use 10cmx10cm post-it's which are also available and then cut them vertically in half so that you have two 5cmx10cm post-it's which would give you space for about 15 to 20 daily tasks.<br><br>Note 2: If you want, you can draw a vertical line through all of the circles to mark the check list as 'done' for today, so that the next day you have a little more obvious view of which daily tasks are still open.<br><br>What do you think?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2011 at 11:42 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Note 3: Of course, you could also treat the daily tasks as a pool out of which you can draw tasks for Column 2. Though I think I would only do that if the task can't be finished in one go, so that column 2 doesn't get filled too quickly.<br><br>Note 4: The dots for a whole week allow you to quickly see how you fared over the whole week in doing your daily tasks. For example, I have 'lunch' as a task which is one I'm pretty bad at completing. I have the bad habit of having a good breakfast and then not eating until dinner, so this week overview would quickly show me how well I've been eating in the past week.<br><br>Note 5: Putting these somewhat 'trivial' tasks on a daily check list makes it less easy to 'rush' through my SF pages, so that the *real* tasks will get done as well.<br><br>I will report how well this system worked in a week's time!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2011 at 11:59 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You can download the very simple Microsoft Word document I used to print this post-it here: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/426952/daily-checklist-postit.doc">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/426952/daily-checklist-postit.doc</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2011 at 12:25 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's really cool. I've had on my list to do something similar but I'm thinking I'll just use a card stock bookmark. (How do you print post-its?)

Good to see you're consistent with Douchen :')<br>Compared to the thread I started, this only has routine items, not incidentals which to me are more at risk of being forgotten.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2011 at 15:56 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan: "this only has routine items, not incidentals which to me are more at risk of being forgotten." <br><br>I'll elaborate on my plan. The regular daily part I haven't decided I'm thinking I'll only put the check-off circles by the things I am inclined to forget (like I just realized I took one med this morning, but still need to take the other two). I will include some things I want to 'work on'. <br><br>The things that elude me are the 'every other day' or 'every three days' or even 'once a week' things that I could set arbitrary days of the week for, but this way I should be able to easily see when they were last done without cluttering up a calendar. <br><br>I've tried this before in various formats but they were always either very separate from whatever system I had in place or if I was using an electronic system (OF or RTM) I'd set them up on a repeat cycle and I'd step away for a day or two and the repeats would inundate me. I tried reminders on my phone, but I also tend to ignore those. <br><br>I think this could work well for me. However, I find that I am not that consistent at using my home list throughout the work week. So I could be in the same boat. However, I'm hoping that one will drive the other. I'm hoping that if I make the bookmark, it'll also encourage me to use SF more during the weekday evenings and get a little more done.<br><br>ETA: Also, I'm thinking there will be room for a small post it with 'today' one-off's written in. (I don't have more than 3 generally.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2011 at 16:06 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Tijl,<br><br>I'm doing something very similar, the only difference being that I keep the list of daily routines in my iPhone. I put a task "daily @iPhone" in column 2 of my notebook, which I move to the next page when I've completed only a few tasks of the checklist. When I start from the checklist and don't complete a task in one go, I also put that single task in column 2 of the next page.  I've tried doing it on paper, but for this checklist I like the digital approach better, easier to adapt from week to week to remove already ingrained habits from the list or add new / stubborn ones that need reminding.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2011 at 12:53 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Something I did in earlier versions of Mark’s systems and have revised in SF is to write my tasks in the following manner. <br><br>(3/14)Daily work 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10<br><br>The numbers correspond to a checklist that I keep on an index card. It includes things like 1. Process in box; 2. Review pending reports; 3. Set appointments etc.<br><br>If I complete the whole list of tasks in one go (very unlikely) I cross it off. If I don’t finish all the tasks, I rewrite in column 2 those tasks I did not complete.

I will be mixing &amp; matching. I used to move a Post-It from page to page with some key items on it, but I wasn't being as clever as some of you in this thread.<br><br>My one-page folded booklet approach is still working well enough that I've kept it up. Each night I compile everything I need to know about the following day, pulling from various shared Google calendars, the family weekly schedule, my exercise routine, the errands I want to think of whenever I happen to be near the right store, etc. One section holds to-do's due that day which do not have a specific appointment time. I don't tend to enter them in Column Two at all any more, unless I don't finish them in one sitting. I just glance at the list periodically to make sure I'm up to date. On busy days, I do write one reminder in Column Two to keep looking at the list so I keep up to date with each page turn.<br><br>The thing is, it is getting a little annoying making this page every night. I suppose there's not much way around it though. I'll need to look at all of that info one way or another, so might as well get it all done up front!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 March 2011 at 5:38 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jennifer B.:<br><br>&lt;&lt;Something I did in earlier versions of Mark’s systems and have revised in SF is to write my tasks in the following manner. <br><br>(3/14)Daily work 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10&gt;&gt;<br><br>Thanks for the tip.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 March 2011 at 12:56 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Tijl's suggestion is proving to be the most useful so far for me in dealing with daily recurring tasks. I've been struggling with Column 2 entries. <br><br>FAILED EXPERIMENT 1<br><br>In my attempts to practise 'little and often', I made up a list of about 15 activities that I thought I should attempt every day. I entered them on Col 2. <br><br>This system soon collapsed for the following reasons:<br><br>(a) Although most only required 5-10 mins' attention, it was unrealistic to think I could do them all each day. On some days I have hours to spend on my tasks; on others I only have about an hour to work the system. <br><br>(b) They also filled up my Col 2 too quickly, and I'd be suddenly faced with dismissing a full page of Col 1 tasks when I was still struggling with the Col 2s.<br><br>(c) Some were time-specific, so wouldn't necessarily have to be done before Col 1 activities.<br><br><br>This was too overwhelming. <br><br>FAILED EXPERIMENT 2<br><br>So my next experiment was to enter virtually all these activities as Col 1 tasks. I have rather a long list of them (about 350). This method enabled me to start flying through Col 1 pages, but I'd try to keep an eye on the full list. When I reached a point where a task just had to be done before I reached it naturally, I'd bring it forward to Col 2. I accepted that I wasn't going to succeed in tackling a bit of everything every day, but as long as I kept moving and motivated it was OK.<br><br>This felt like quite a freeing exercise. But problems arose:<br><br>(a) With time-specific tasks. For example, 'exercise' is one thing I always like to do first thing in the morning. And I might wish to 'prepare a meal' at varying times throughout the day. <br><br>(b) Certain items, such as 'attend to emails' were more urgent at some points than others. <br><br>(c) I just didn't feel I had a proper grip on my task list.<br><br>EXPERIMENT 3 (performed with optimism!) <br><br>So now, I've isolated 6 items (no more!)  that I really want to do every day at various points (but I'm not going to beat myself up if I can't do them for some reason).<br><br>Column 2 can remain for one-off urgent tasks.<br><br>I'm going to use Tijl's template to print my 6 items with neat little circles on a sheet of sticky labels, and then attach one label at a time to a Post-it note. <br><br>Phew! I feel I'm getting there, and really appreciate all these ideas and suggestions that people are putting forward.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 March 2011 at 13:09 | Katreya</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Katreya,<br><br>Your ideas seem really interesting but there are a couple things I am confused about.<br><br>In your failed experiment #1, you mention "15 activities", then in #2, it's ballooned to 350 (!!) activities, and then in #3, it's down to 6.<br><br>I am guessing that the 350 activities refers to the total number of items on your SF list?   This would make more sense.<br><br>So, that would then seem to mean that you have whittled your 15 daily activities down to 6 daily activities -- is this correct?<br><br>Assuming this is the case, I have a few more questions.  :-)<br><br>Do you keep these on a separate sticky that travels with you from page to page until all items listed on the sticky are completed?   I would guess that no rules apply in this case -- they are treated as "extra" items that don't get dismissed and don't trigger any particular rules.  Is that the case?<br><br>Or do you treat them as a set of supplementary C2 items that must be completed before you can leave the first SF page of the day?<br><br>Thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 March 2011 at 23:31 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>Yes, 350 is the approx. total no. of SF activities. <br><br>Although I'm physically keeping my 'sticky list' in my SF notebook where it's constantly visible on my current page, I'm NOT INCLUDING it in the rules. (In a similar way as one has to keep a Calendar for meetings, appointments, etc.)<br><br>These items are things I aim to do every day when practically possible, but not necessarily before the C1 items. <br><br>Although Mark suggests that the C2 list should be used for regular daily tasks, I couldn't come to terms with his advice of putting them in Column 2 "when the time approaches that  the task should be done". <br><br>I did say that I was going to keep C2 for purely one-off urgent tasks, but I was then reminded of Mark's aims of SF being a good system to FINISH tasks. So I may use it for particular projects with a deadline, where I need to work on a bit a day for a certain time period. But I'm going to be careful with this usage.<br><br>I really feel much freer, having drastically cut my C2 list. Although, actually, there are many items I think I SHOULD be doing every day, it feels much more motivating to gallop through the C1 list, waiting for these items to 'stand out', than plough wearily through them as a C2 list because I'm obliged to. And if, for some reason, a few minutes of learning French, or file purging doesn't happen in a day, it's not the end of the world.<br><br>However, I'm still experimenting...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 March 2011 at 8:00 | Katreya</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I love Tijl's idea of running the post-it through the copier. I use Sciral Consistency for my repeating tasks, but I wish I could have it on paper somehow, or even an app on my Android phone. It's a brilliant program. It would be nice to have it more mobile.<br><br>I have 3 Sciral lists which I open each day. "Morning Routine" and "Evening Routine" have tasks that I want to do every day (but for some of them I allow a range of 1-2 days.)
