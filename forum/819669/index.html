I think I've looked at all the examples, and I've worked through a mock list of my own.  There's just something conceptual that doesn't want to fit into my brain.<br><br>Maybe an example will help point where I'm going wrong.  Let's say I have a successful day and made it through many items throughout all pages.  Through some random quirk, my oldest page of items now has 14 undone items... alternating with done items:<br>   1. undone<br>   2. done<br>   3. undone<br>   4. done<br>   5. undone<br>   ...repeat <br><br>Let's say over the following two weeks, I'm mostly focused on the newest pages -- never making it anywhere near that oldest page.  Since each of my oldest items composes a "block of 1" -- does that mean I'll be dismissing one item each day for the next two weeks?<br><br>Maybe my hang-up is that the dismissal process (at one end of the list) seems totally disconnected from whatever progress I'm making (at the other end).  And the dismissal process is also dependent on whatever pattern my finished tasks create.  In my hypothetical situation, if I had only one completed in the middle of the last page, I'd be dismissing them all in 2 days instead of 2 weeks.<br><br>I'm not arguing the process -- I didn't get the happy feel for AF until I tried it -- but I felt confident I understood the instructions.  With AF2, the dismissal instructions just can't find a logical hook in my brain.  Skip logic for a bit?  Or correct my understanding of how it works?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 June 2009 at 4:38 | slothbear</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Slothbear<br><br>As I see it, you understand the process perfectly.<br><br>As for the logical hook you want, recall that Mark is trying to make dismissal less of a hit-and-miss process.  At any moment you can tell almost exactly how many days it is likely to be before old items must be either worked on or dismissed.  This makes it much easier for me to judge, in the days leading up to possible dismissal, just how important to me these older items really are and where they fit into the scheme of things.  Hence I find I am not dismissing anything by "accident" or inattention.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 June 2009 at 5:15 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Slothbear,<br><br>yes, you understand the process perfectly.<br><br>What's new with AF2 is that you work on your list in three different ways:<br><br>1)  Doing the newest tasks from the end of the list (achievement)<br><br>2)  Dismissing old tasks that you didn't do (analysing your problems)<br><br>3) Reading your whole list and getting that "Uhoh, I should do something about this"-Feeling (making decisions).<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 June 2009 at 9:04 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hmm.  So it's a feature, not a bug.  I think I'm starting to get it.<br><br>I was used to action and dismissal all intertwined in AF1, which was a kind of bug.  With AF2, the dismissals march inexorably from the start of the list, not caring what's going on at the other end.<br><br>Well, the dismissals don't care.  But I intuitively care, knowing they're on the march.  The delicious pressure others have mentioned.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 14:48 | slothbear</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>slothbear:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Let's say over the following two weeks, I'm mostly focused on the newest pages -- never making it anywhere near that oldest page. Since each of my oldest items composes a "block of 1" -- does that mean I'll be dismissing one item each day for the next two weeks? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, that's exactly what will happen IF you never make it anywhere near that oldest page. So why would you never make it anywhere near the oldest page? Probably because you are immersed in urgent actions and don't get a chance to deal with more long-term affairs. So the rate of dismissal slows down to allow for that. <br><br>Once the pressure of urgent items slacks off a bit, you will probably succeed in filling some of those gaps anyway and the dismissal process will speed up.<br><br>&lt;&lt; In my hypothetical situation, if I had only one completed in the middle of the last page, I'd be dismissing them all in 2 days instead of 2 weeks. &gt;&gt;<br><br>This would be unlikely unless you had dumped a lot of tasks from an earlier to-do list. If that were the case the dismissal process would get moving fast in order to eject them.<br><br>So actually far from the dismissal process being totally unrelated to what is going on at the end of the list, it actually responds very sensitively to it.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 15:16 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I do think part of what's going on here is that AF2 seems to fundamentally alter the notion of "standing out". You say that you'll never get back up to the items on notice for dismissal because you're down at the end of the list. But AF2 implies that, because you know there are some tasks on notice for dismissal further back in the list, your scanning of the list will lead you back up to those items. To me, this is a rather less intuitive form of "standing out", and a rather more rational-brain kind of process. <br><br>That's actually not a criticism, because I always questioned why AF1's particular balance of rational vs intuitive should be taken as a given, and personally I prefer a larger role for the rational mind. But it does change things. In AF1, I'd be looking at the list and something would almost magically pop out into my awareness. In AF2, I'm very consciously aware of being pulled past the end-of-list items in order to get to the ones on notice for dismissal.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 15:20 | ludlow</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
