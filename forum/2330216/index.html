I use my mind to decide when I want to do the things in my system. Additionally I am currently just using an old "system" of mine which is simply to use one notebook for everything including to dos and notes so I also use it to capture information I need to remember.

Adding mine to the mix, here's what I want to accomplish:<br><br>- I do want to have it assist me in getting a broad feel for what's on my plate<br><br>- I want to be able to note down anything I think of on the spur of the moment that I might not remember later on.  But I don't want to capture every single thing I need to do.<br><br>- I want to remember who I'm waiting on for something.<br><br>- I want the system itself to be so thin as to be invisible and I don't want to have to follow any rules to be able to use it.<br><br>- I want to be able to split any notes up by topic where it makes sense, eg if I have a load of things I want to remember or am waiting for relating to a particular topic then I want them grouped together.<br><br>- I want to use the same system in the same way for work and home stuff.<br><br>- I want it to contain a calendar so I can see when I'm free and note down appointments, things happening on certain dates and so on.<br><br>- I want it to be trivially simple to use, no need to install software, no reliance on a particular kind of platform like ios, windows, os x, no need for a web site.<br><br>- I want it to be electronic not paper based.<br><br>- I want to be able to use it just as easily when I'm out and about as when I'm sat in front of a computer.<br><br>- I want it to be trivial to keep clean and current.<br><br>The solution I use is a single text file which I store in dropbox.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 April 2014 at 14:12 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I just like systems.   <br><br>I want to live debt free.   Not all debts are financial.   Sometimes our systems start to define us rather than enable us, and then it's like being in debt to the system, it just presents to me a set of unfulfilled obligations.   "The borrower is slave to the lender".   How awful when our own creations become our masters.<br><br>I've been pondering the main "system" of the monastics:  their calendar and daily schedule.   I'm realizing that how I set up and follow my personal calendar has a far greater impact on my life than how I handle my outstanding tasks.   My discretionary time is a lot less than my scheduled time.   E.g. at work it's about 60% or more pre-scheduled, at home it's a higher percentage than that.    <br><br>This reminds me of Dave Ramsey's advice not to mess around too much with debt consolidation, chasing after a lower-rate credit card to which to transfer one's balance of credit card debt, etc.    Let's say you currently have a debt with a 25% rate and you find a way to transfer it and now you have a 10% rate.   Congratulations, you just solved a mere 15% of your problem.   The real problem is the *balance*, not the interest rate.   Better to focus on paying off the *balance* rather than think one has accomplished something by moving the debts around.<br><br>Getting older and seeing my kids grow up and leave the home makes me realize how finite our time is.   It really is more important to have a "not do" list rather than a "to do" list - at least in one's attitude about what commitments one accepts.   The to-do list (of commitments) should be very small and focused.  <br><br>I'm learning from Scrum some very good ways to keep it small and focused:   keep a backlog of all the stuff you need to do.   Keep it somewhat prioritized by the VALUE these things deliver.   The highest value things need a clear 1-2-3-4-5 priority, the lower value things need larger buckets and don't waste time getting too granular - they are low priority after all, which means many of them will never get done, so why waste time prioritizing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2014 at 7:18 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oops, I tried to revise my post but the time expired.  Here's a continuation.<br><br>So once you have your backlog, decide on your cadence.   Weekly, daily, variable, whatever.   A regular cadence is helpful because it offers some predictability - how much can I accomplish in a period.   Then decide on a short list of high-value things to COMPLETE in that period.   Pull these from the top part of your backlog.<br><br>This combines the open list for capture, with the closed list for execution.   Execution is small, committed, and focused.   <br><br>It's not a "system" but then maybe systems aren't all they claim to be.   Was it Eisenhower who said "Plans are nothing; planning is everything?"   Good systems are the "planning" - they help you engage with your work, so when it's time for execution and things are moving fast, you've already thought through many of the situations you encounter and are prepared to respond.  Bad systems are the "plans" - they create an unworkable plan or process you feel obligated to follow but don't deliver the value, and actually make it harder to respond to changing circumstances.<br><br>A calendar with half the discretionary time filled with pomodoros representing my short-term committed focused work seems to be working pretty well.   Enough "planning" to engage with my work.   Enough structure to keep me from falling into chaos.   Enough focus to get the most valuable work done.   Low maintenance.  I like the low maintenance.   I really don't want to spend very much more time in my life optimizing the flow of the minutiae.  <br><br>Sorry for the rambling disjointed thoughts.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2014 at 7:41 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I've been pondering the main "system" of the monastics: their calendar and daily schedule. I'm realizing that how I set up and follow my personal calendar has a far greater impact on my life than how I handle my outstanding tasks &gt;&gt;<br><br>I once worked out a way of dividing up the day according to the old monastic prayers. This was intended for people in full-time work who nevertheless wanted to say the full breviary. My conclusion was that it would probably produce a more focused day than just working the whole time and might actually add to productivity, not to mention any spiritual benefit.<br><br>1. Get up an hour early, and say Matins and Lauds<br>2. After breakfast and before starting work, say Prime<br>3. Halfway through the morning, say Terce.<br>4. During lunch break, say Sext<br>5. Halfway through the afternoon, say None<br>6. After work, say Vespers.<br>7. Before going to bed, say Compline.<br><br>This splits up the day into sections rather like a school timetable, but also ensures that you have a good start and finish to the day and have a period to focus before starting wsork and a break to wind down after work.<br><br>I realise the Orthodox prayers are a bit different from the Catholic ones, but I expect you get the idea!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2014 at 15:02 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Thanks for that. I've decided to try breaking up my day between set prayer times (not the Breviary as I'm Protestant, but a similar time arrangement) to try to kill two birds with one stone - improving my prayer habits and seeing if the time blocks help me be more productive.<br><br>Similarly, I've often reflected on how keeping a weekly sabbath on the Lord's Day helps me be more productive on the six working days. For the entirety of the time I've been using your systems, I've always excluded Sunday entirely from the systems - e.g., when using DIT on Saturday, tomorrow=Monday. I'm fond of this quotation by Bishop J.C. Ryle:<br><br>"The Sabbath is good for nations. It has an enormous effect both on the character and temporal prosperity of a people. I firmly believe that a people which regularly rests one day in seven will do more work and better work in a year than a people which never rest at all. Their hands will be stronger; their minds will be clearer; their power of attention, application, and steady perseverance will be far greater."<br>-J.C. Ryle, "The Sabbath: A Day to Keep"<br><br>I have found Ryle's sentiment to be true in my own experience. I wonder if the same kind of thing could be said from structuring one's days around set prayer times?<br><br>Thanks for the idea.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 April 2014 at 18:12 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Austin:<br><br>Quite apart from the spiritual aspects of this, there is quite a well-established way of structuring one's day which is based on the school timetable (as it was when I was at school anyway!).<br><br>The theory is that the optimum working period is 40 minutes followed by a break of 10 minutes followed by another 40 minute period with a break of 30 minutes. This is then repeated through the day, allowing for longer breaks for meal times, etc. Most conferences and training courses follow a similar pattern.<br><br>I don't think it's a coincidence that this resembles the school timetable which in my day was typically:<br><br>Period 1 0900-0940<br>Period 2 0950-1030<br><br>Period 3 1100-1140<br>Period 4 1150-1230<br><br>Period 5 1400-1440<br>Period 6 1450-1530<br><br>Period 7 1600-1640<br>Period 8 1650-1730<br><br>Ideally each period would concentrate on one subject, with double periods where necessary. I don't think we every spent more than two periods a day on a single subject, except in the run-up to exams (in which case the period would be "revision" or "private study").<br><br>We worked Saturday mornings, but never on Sundays.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 April 2014 at 0:13 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark Forster:<br><br>"The theory is that the optimum working period is 40 minutes followed by a break of 10 minutes followed by another 40 minute period with a break of 30 minutes."<br><br><br>Much in common with these:<br><br>Pierre Khawand's "Results Curve": focus for 40 --&gt; short break --&gt; focus for 40...<br><br>Robin Sharma's 90 minute blocks of action: focus for two 45 minute periods --&gt; 30 minute break...<br><br>The human body's 90 minute ultradian rhythms: 45 minutes of activity --&gt; peak --&gt; 45 minutes of activity --&gt; rest...<br><br>Movies are often around 90 minutes: 1 hour is too short, 2 hours is often too long.<br><br>Article on 90 minute cycles:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.idonethis.com/post/33892676864/science-of-better-energy-management">http://blog.idonethis.com/post/33892676864/science-of-better-energy-management</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 April 2014 at 6:13 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Michael B.<br><br>The school timetable has probably been much the same for centuries (perhaps millenia) so I think this is just something that humans naturally fall into when working as a body.<br><br>The characteristic of a day structured like this is that it seems long with definite feelings of achievement.
