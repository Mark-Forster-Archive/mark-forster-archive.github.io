This may replace Autofocus?  You must be kidding!  I have spent so much time and effort to adapt my busy professional life to AF and after many problems and adjustments....and now it is working....and you tell us you may have ANOTHER new system?

And AF has made a major impact on the way I'm doing things although I've deviated and added other elements. I always think there is a better way. The fallacy is thinking the better way will suit everyone. But I have to admit that is part of the drive for me. <br><br>Keep on innovating! <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 April 2009 at 23:27 | Peter K</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seems like a pattern here?<br><br>Mark retires - creates Autofocus<br><br>Mark goes on holiday - creates new system<br><br>I think it's awesome!<br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 April 2009 at 23:29 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Fine -- got it -- you all enjoy it.

Many of us here just didn't get GTD and came looking for something that would work better. DIT worked well for some of us here but not many. AF worked well for many of us who didn't do well with GTD and DIT. So, the hoopla. <br><br>But AF wasn't a panacea for a few of us including you and me. For many reasons, we have our own "workarounds" to get us over the hump. My hope is that Mark when he provides us with something, it will help me move to the next step/level. If it doesn't work for me, I don't have to adopt it. But there is nothing to lose to check it out, is there?<br><br>All the best!<br><br>GC</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2009 at 1:20 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Call it what you want. <br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2009 at 2:13 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sorry to all.

I find that I take something from each system/book and add it to what I do.  I love it that a new system to try might be coming - I feel like a kid waiting for Christmas and I don't often get that feeling at 37.  I doubt the new system will be "The Answer" because in reality the perfect system doesn't exist.

Everything change everytime. It's a world of movment. It's just life. <br><br>all the trhread on this forum just prouve that AF is like a diamond -. Since i used it it works.

You are a busy man, and you've been very generous with your time in describing your experiences with DIT, AF etc.  This has given a valuable insight into how the systems work, or not, for someone with your heavy workload.  <br><br>Mark Forster is also a very generous man, who has shared his experiences and insights, and has provided us with a fantastic system (which of course we are under no obligation to adopt).   <br><br>The relationship between Mark and us is not a commercial one of service provider and customer - he is under no obligation to provide us with a 'product' and we have no right to demand redress if we are not satisfied with his product.   He could easily lie back and enjoy his retirement without giving a fig for any of us.  The fact that he is so generous with his time and so patient in responding to our many queries should be applauded.  It's a win-win situation, where he provides new ideas and suggestions for us, and he receives feedback and ideas from us.   <br><br>Let's stay positive!<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2009 at 10:40 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Right with you all post Margaret !

I tried GTD, Covey, AF, wrote my own and still look for new ideas.  <br><br>Lets face it for some of us there is a "hobby" element to all of this and we enjoy thinking and tinkering about productivity.  Mark has generously provided AF for free and supported it with this forum, also for free.  I am sure given his following it could have been a product and made him some money, but he has decided to make it free.  Additionally, he has allowed the discussion of other methods to be had freely here.  All this leads me to believe he is genuinely looking to help people become more productive.  This is how new stuff gets invented and society improves.  <br><br>thanks<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2009 at 15:19 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Speaking of Covey... if they didn't botch up - I mean, really slaughter - PlanPlus for Outlook, I'd still be doing by weekly reviews WITH PlanPlus today.

Thanks for continuing to work on these systems.  AF doesn't work for everyone, DIT doesn't work for everyone, there are just too many personalities and job/home situations that make for some preferring one over another.  <br><br>To David:  Why you are so rude and condescending is beyond me.  As Mark said, he gives you a free system, has helped you and responded to your personal questions over the entire time I've visited this forum, and you get upset because he makes something new now that your life is in order?  And if your life is now in order, why are you visiting the forum?  It's your choice to implement the systems, no one is making you do it.  Personally I hope Mark invents 30 new systems and then doesn't respond to any of your questions since that seems like that'd be complete hell for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 May 2009 at 17:03 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>TK:<br><br>David has publicly apologised on another thread.

It seems obvious to me that he didn't read the reasons behind your behaviour before commenting, and he was saying what I for one, initially thought but didn't want my comments to go down on the web.
