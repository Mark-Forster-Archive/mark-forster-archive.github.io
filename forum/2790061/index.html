The end result was that you always felt like you had things to do and were working on something and getting things done, but you may or may not have been actually producing tangible and "profitable" external results (output).<br><br>I believe Mark has addressed this in a few comments here and there, but I do think that this issue doesn't receive enough fundamental attention. I think there is an argument to be made that it would be better to have a slightly faster rate of completion in exchange for a reduced overall efficiency of action (filling up the pipeline). <br><br>Mark has pointed out a few times that it's better to reduce the total number of "projects in motion" and get Project A done before starting Project B, etc. He has pointed to things like weeding lists as a method for managing this, but I can't help but feel like this is maybe the least satisfactory element of a single long list system. If I'm not using a someday/maybe list (which is meant to store anything that you may do in the future but aren't strictly committed to taking action on right now), then I really only have a single list on which to record my things that I want to work on, but ideally, in such a system, all the items on the list should be things that I can and do want to take action on. But then, if I'm intentionally not going to start working on Project B until I'm done with Project A, where do I put Project B in the meantime? If I put it on the long list, then that will lead to the temptation to start on Project B before Project A is complete as well as contributing to the increased length of the list, but putting it somewhere else either requires estimation (something I'd like to avoid) or maintaining a someday/maybe list. <br><br>I think at least in theory, if you can somehow manage to avoid starting too many projects, then you'll have a degree of concentration on an appropriately limited number of outputs, and if you keep taking action on them, they will get done, and if you do this consistently, then you will reach some level of equilibrium in terms of your regular output. At that point, it's just a matter of making sure that you have some way to ensure that things stay off your list or out of your way while you are working on other things and that they have some way of getting onto your active list at the right point in time. If you get that right, then I don't think there should be any issue with the list growing too long, because many of those things will be "inactive" at the moment. <br><br>I think if I were to try this out, what I'd be most interested in as a metric to track is the number of outputs that I actually complete and "ship" per some given time period, relative to the other systems that I might use. Does anyone have some idea about how to track this?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 June 2022 at 5:22 | Aaron Hsu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A simple question: does "do at least some work" mean the same thing in this system as "work as long as you feel like" in other long list systems?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 June 2022 at 11:41 | Aaron Hsu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Aaron Hsu:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I think at least in theory, if you can somehow manage to avoid starting too many projects, then you'll have a degree of concentration on an appropriately limited number of outputs... &gt;&gt;<br><br>Is the problem you describe too many "projects" or just too many "tasks" per se? I think of the occasional tendency of getting drawn to do one-off tasks, some of which don't really need to be done. For me, that was more to be be avoided more than starting too many big projects at once. <br><br>&lt;&lt; At that point, it's just a matter of making sure that you have some way to ensure that things stay off your list or out of your way while you are working on other things and that they have some way of getting onto your active list at the right point in time &gt;&gt;<br><br>If this is what we should be doing, it seems tricky. Off the top of my head, it seems that some Forster systems tried to achieve something similar: e.g., AF4-3T, AF4R, and Superfocus--with their emphasis on unfinished tasks; DIT and RAF, which give you a sense of what you can handle each day. And, of course, no-list. <br><br>Anyway, this probably getting far afield from the new system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 June 2022 at 14:30 | Belacqua</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I suppose if you aim to complete things sooner, you ought to resist starting additional new things, therefore according to the rules of RZ, you won’t mark those for action.  I strongly agree that one should focus on important tasks to make progress on them and bring to fruition.  To that end, I still follow what I wrote in “How to pursue all your goals”, which is that the foundation is <br><br>                to regularly think on your goals and how you will advance them.  <br><br>The specific process by which you do this is much less important than just having and sticking to some process that includes this.  The more you focus on what you want to accomplish, the lower your resistance will be to the activities that get you there, and the higher resistance will be to activities that do not.  <br><br>To that end, if you think RZ is a good process to try, and you want to get more progress on things you deem important, be sure to add the tasks to think on these things to the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 June 2022 at 14:52 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Tracking completed work: Use a highlighter when a task is completed done, (not when it is suspended and reentered).<br><br>Suggestion: Draw a line at the bottom of your list.

The question came to mind because your latest recommendation--say "no resistance" once, then do a quick scan--sounded like it was moving in the direction of "standing out."<br><br>I found scanning for no resistance easy enough. But not as easy as standing out. Standing out is the least mentally taxing way to select from a long list in my experience.

But not FV<br>But RZ might change my view about it<br><br>- It removes the decision fatigue w/ SS, bcoz there's pre-selected list. If I don't finish the pre-selected list, I've been coming the next day and finish it, which takes me to the beginning of the list and I do the scan again.<br>- Sometimes it suprises to see the next task. Oh wow! I get to do this now, finally :) Bcoz the criteria unlike earlier was 'Is this zero resistance', not 'Better than the other'<br>- Related to above point, since it's NQ, it's ZR task, not must-do task, which artificially inflates my resistance, along with it my anxiety<br>- Addition: I draw a line (&amp; date) when I start adding new tasks while on RZ method. Or else I don't where the original list ends.<br>- Addition: I also mark the date of the task completed; it helps me see my progress and also it hides the 'dots'. Otherwise I don't know which dot is done, which ain't, despite the strikethrough. Yeah, that's me.... haha :)<br><br>Issues:<br>- Impulse to do a task now while scanning :P Like SS - what to do about it?<br>- I get to do only one scanning per day. Is that okay? Or any other better way of doing it?<br>- Sometimes a RZ task dotted might grow resistance later... Is that okay? I try do something on it, for 10 mins and reenter and move up the list<br>- Urgent or quick mosquito tasks? Is it okay if I quickly enter it, be done with it and get back to my dotted task again<br><br>Once again, thanks Mark</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 July 2022 at 13:42 | Sathya</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Issues, my suggestions:<br>- Scan very very quickly so you don’t feel a chance to do anything as you’re scanning.<br>- it might be okay.  I’d suggest review the total list for how long it might take to do it all.  Make sure it fits a day or less than.  You can always be deliberate and shorten how long you work a thing so it all fits.  Refer to the 30,60,90 post.<br>- I think it’s best to make yourself do a dotted task you no longer want to do, even if it’s just a tiny progression.  Even far less than 10 minutes maybe, just make it a meaningful advance.

Very intriguing. Thanks Mark.<br><br>I'm going to give this a try, but I am curious how effective this is at dealing with urgent tasks/projects. Suppose I have two hairy projects that need my attention but that I really don't want to do—that is, resistance is really high. I don't have the luxury of scanning through my list selecting 10 other items of lesser urgency and doing those 10 first. I absolutely need to finish those two projects as soon as possible.<br><br>One benefit of the question "standing out as being ready to be done" is that tasks that you don't want to do but need to do get dotted. I may have force myself in varying degrees to start on them, but I at least do them and make progress to getting those urgent projects out the door. How does "zero resistance" take into account things you don't want to do but know you need to do now? Perhaps there's more nuance to zero resistance than I realize. Zero resistance just seems like a fundamentally different instruction that standing out.<br><br>Also with the two projects, one of the benefits of SS is that you can alternate those two projects at the end of the list, and bounce back and forth until they are done.

I think I've usually only applied that to small things like "somebody needs me to answer an email now", or "I need to go pick up my child now".  Something that is one and done in a few minutes.  But I guess I haven't considered needing to apply it to a larger project that lasts for days or weeks.  In these cases I've always thought it should go on the lists.  You've expanded my understanding of "do it now if it needs doing now".  <br><br>I've starting using the system this morning and so far I'm liking it.  It feels more enjoyable than SS, which is surprising to me.  Trying to crank though a mini-list from a large list feels less oppressive than simple scanning infinite-looping list.
