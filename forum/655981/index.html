Presumably the 'stops' should just lead back to 'start'?

Something you could use to write a computer program to run it.  I guess that makes me a "linear thinker".<br><br>There are some other things you could do to tweak the chart, to simplify it and make is less like a programmer's flowchart, but still keep it as a closed system.

When I did the first flow chart (several weeks ago now) I was surprised at how complicated it really is.  There are so many things that are easily expressed in words "like work on that page until nothing stands out" which are not easily expressed in a flowchart.  By the time you are done, there are lots of tests and loops.  And just think if you included the tweaks that some of us have made.  Just adding tags tot he items introduces another level of tests and loops ... for each tag!<br><br>But they sure look purtty ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 13:21 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find flow charts fascinating but don't use them extensively.

Unless you are trying to convert the process to a software application, I don't see the value in flowcharting such a simple concept.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 February 2009 at 6:13 | L.T.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi L.T.<br><br>Although I don't use flowcharts extensively, they are an incredibly useful tool for graphically representing a process.  The difficulty sometimes of grasping a process has little to do with the simplicity or complexity of the process itself but with the preferred method of thinking.<br><br>For example, someone trained in mathematical analysis will probably want to understand every detail of a process, in which case a flowchart is a fantastic tool.  However someone who works more in a creative environment may be more used to the "bigger picture" approach and would perhaps feel flowcharts unnecessary.<br><br>Perhaps the best example of how the style of thinking comes out most is in the use of a product manual.  Some people will wish to read the manual in detail before plugging in the new DVD recorder or whatever.  Others will just get started and only refer to the manual in case of something specific they wish to know.  Neither method is "wrong" but just illustrates the differences in approach to the same task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 February 2009 at 10:04 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sigh - wish I'd seen this one before I spent an hour or three doing my own:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://darklingwood.typepad.com/autofocus.pdf">http://darklingwood.typepad.com/autofocus.pdf</a><br><br>But I agree with whoever said it was complicated.

You can simplify quite a lot if you leave certain things as implied or understood.  The problem with that approach is you then leave things open to misunderstanding.<br><br>My flowchart tends more toward the explicitly-define-every-step approach, whereas Tommy's is simpler but assumes a bit more about what the reader is expected to understand.  I personally prefer Tommy's approach, but tried to be more explicit in my own flowchart, since there has been so much misunderstanding about when to dismiss things, when to move on to the next page, and so on.<br><br>It's also possible to use a modular approach, with a simpler overall flowchart, with optional additional details for each step.  But it's not always easy to break things down into the appropriate modules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 February 2009 at 17:11 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Some processes just aren't easy to flowchart or describe as an algorithm -- much easier to show.

I found that the wording gets more and more involved until you you wind up back at a text description.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 9:33 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike!<br><br>1) Yes there is: "Go to the last task on the list" -&gt; "Does that task stand out?" -no-&gt; "Go to the next unactioned task before the current one" -&gt; "Does that task stand out?" - The last question is not about the same task as the previous one anymore.<br><br>2) You don't have to keep doing it until it is finished, you write just answer "no" to the question wether it stands out. In what order do you do the steps if you rewrite a task to the end of the list? I first rewrite it, then I work from there - but usually I don't do the task I just rewrote again.<br><br>3) Well, I do say "go to the next unactioned task before the current one", but I don't say "go to the last unactioned task on the list", it's just "last task", I'll change that, thanks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 9:46 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas,<br><br>Sorry, I did not mean to sound picky.  After all, you've produced a very nice tool and simply given it away.<br><br>My only thinking in making the comment is that the main audience for that flowchart will be people who don't know the system ... after all, we don't really need a flowchart now.  For those who don't understand the system and are looking at a flow chart, it probably should be very precise in covering every possibility in a way that they can understand.<br><br>Again, I was not intending to be picky, just offering feedback I thought might help the bewildered who did not understand the system.  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 20:39 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike, I didn't think you sounded picky, so no worries. I just can't see issues 1 and 2. Perhaps it's because I made the flowchart myself, but it does seem clear to me that you're not stuck on the last item. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 22:11 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Heh, hi all ... thanks Seraphim for posting the pdf of my flowchart for David.  I've been away from here, mostly because I haven't actually been using Autofocus.  And then there came this "new" version to ignore for awhile... I haven't tried it yet, but it looks interesting.<br><br>Anyways, I just wanted to say that my flowchart was indeed a "better than working" thing to do.  It also helped me understand the processes involved, so I could decide whether it seemed it would work for me.  (I guess forgetting to ever open the notebook again was a sign that my intuition didn't think this would work for me.)<br><br>When (or if) I restart Autofocus with the new version or mode or whatever, I'll probably make up a flowchart then as well, just so I can get a grasp of how the whole system ... flows.  (Imagine that: a flowchart shows flows! :P)  I'll probably wait until I reboot my life after my thesis is done... because right now, every list I make seems to take me away from my thesis.  No more lists!  Just DO the damn thing!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2009 at 17:35 | Qrystal</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
