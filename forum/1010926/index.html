Pressing Capslock + F will open a search dialog. Type part of a task name and watch the possibilites narrow down. At any time, double-click a task in the results list to jump there.<br><br>Since two people so far had problems with using and uninstalling the application: this is a portable application. Just unzip somewhere you have access rights (in Vista/7, this means *NOT* the Program Files folder!) and run AutofocusAHK.exe to start the program. The app saves all information in the same directory the exe file is and can even be run from an usb device or be synced via dropbox or similar services. To uninstall, just delete its folder, done. EXCEPT if you activated the "start with windows" option in the preferences. This will create a shortcut in your start menu's startup folder. If you just delete the app, it will try to find it everytime windows starts, but fail. To solve this, either delete the shortcut by and or first uncheck "start with windows" in the preferences and then delete the app.<br><br>Also, if you don't know how to use the app, make sure to read the included readme, or the github main page, or the original thread here in the forum: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/869348">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/869348</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2010 at 3:48 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AndreasH,<br><br>You're reeling me in. Such real-time search or filter, is my favourite feature in my favourite WM/Palm apps, Handyshopper (the more than a shopping list app). ;-)<br><br>I'm still using test data in my tasks.txt for now though. These are the features of "real-time search" in HS that I do not find in AFAHK (yet) ...<br>(1) Press {enter} after typing, drops cursor into the list.<br>(2) Can use {cursor-up-down-keys} to move through the list.<br>(3) Press {enter} while in the list, open the task.<br>(4) Press other keys (not enter or up-down keys) while in the list, it continues narrowing real-time search/filter.<br>(5) Pressing {esc} doesn't close the dialog (it does close other AFAHK dialogs)<br>(6) On start of search/filter shows all tasks (now if you type a character than backspace you get all tasks in AFAHK).<br>(7) If you can do #6 and also show the task dates in real-time, you can make capslock-s to mean "search" not just "show" (and have one less key to remember, and capslock-s is more convenient for one handed press)<br>(8) To also search the notes and url of the tasks (not just the task description).<br>I'm not sure how difficult for you to include the above in AFAHK though. :-}<br><br>regards,<br>sabre23t =^.^=</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2010 at 6:50 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>sabre32t:<br><br>Sorry, I was happy to get search working and it was getting late. (Or rather, early. ^_^)<br><br>Since switching to DWM, I find myself staying up longer to finish stuff from my list and rising earlier to begin doing stuff from my list. It's quite interesting. But somehow I hope that will pass, I'm beginning to feel tired. ;-)<br><br>Anyways, 0.9.4.1 does everything you mentioned (except 7) : <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK-0.9.4.1.zip">http://cloud.github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK-0.9.4.1.zip</a><br><br>Regarding 1-4, I made it so that the search field has always focus. up/down moves through the list without the search field losing focus, enter immediately opens the selected task.<br><br>Regarding 7, I have plans for the show list window. With the find dialog, for the first time you can break the rules of the system you use. (It doesn't matter for DWM, but you can, for example, jump out of the closed list in AF4 or a page in AF1 without dismissing it.) In my mind, that should be the excception. So CapsLock+s will bring up a window shows the current list with respect to the used system and allows you to quickly jump around while adhering to the rules. But if you want, feel free to simply exchange the hotkeys for find and show in the ini file.<br><br>Regarding 8, it does search notes and url now, but it still only shows the task name in the list.

I recommend against 4c, since that would mean you have to take care to handle the meta data correctly by hand, especially the expires date. Whitespace is also very important (it's a difference wether a space or a tab is between fields). I'm thinking of switching the file format to csv, to make it easier to edit.

So some feedbacks on AFAHK v0.9.4.1 (I've redownloaded latest version) ...<br><br>(1) I managed to "corrupt" the tasks.txt file. I used a lot of notes, cut&amp;paste from webpage and apps. Somehow, some of the newlines in the notes were not encoded correctly as "\n" in the tasks.txt. Problem appeared after exiting and reloading AFAHK. It gave spurious "expiring" some tasks message on startup, and the capslock-E function didn't give correct expiry dates.<br><br>(2) I've managed to manually use Crimson Editor (that has show tabs, show space, show linebreak feature) to replace the unencoded newlines with "\n". Now the 31 tasks show correct expiry dates in capslock-E function. I'll monitor more closely if this happens again,  and what could have caused it.<br><br>(3) Now to features, would be nice to show some stats numbers in the capslock-E function. Overall unactioned, done, onreview numbers, as well as per expiry dates. <br><br>(4)  Capslock+D could show "expiry date" of tasks, also the current cycle number through that tasks. Or will I see these task colour coded when it get to expiry-1 and expiry date?<br><br>(5) It'll be convenient if Capslock+A could automatically use "current highlighted text" to be task description. Just as current url is automatically entered in url field.<br><br>Just my requests, if it isn't too difficult.<br><br>Ah, the timer shows I've spent 29+ minutes on this "Chk AFAHK 0.9.4 thread". task. I did spend that long.  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2010 at 16:17 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum:<br><br>1. Oy vey, seems I need to do some testing. If you could tell me from what website/application you copied something that broke, it would help me very much.<br><br>2. That's the advantage of using a pure text format, isn't it? :-)<br><br>3. Okay, I'll add stats to the list. I was thinking about this earlier this day, actually. I wanted to compile stats similar to the ones Mark is posting on the blog, and why not let AutofocusAHK do it?<br><br>4. I'll look what I can do. Right now, the "work" window is still independent of the system you use, so it's the same for AF4 and DWM, for example. But I already customized the title bar depending on the system, so I'll just have to do the same with the content of the window. Or simply show that stuff in the title bar. ;-)<br><br>5. Should be doable. I need to figure out a better way to handle this automatic stuff. I have one task which has an url attached to it which wasn't intended at all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2010 at 17:17 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>sabre23t:<br><br>Sorry, I meant of course to address you.

AF3 has the "Change to Review Mode" task (which I "ported" back to AF1, too), AF4 has automatic review and DWM hasn't got a review process, expired tasks are dead.

Such as "Pay bills". Obviously, I can only act on that when my next paycheck clears. Doing caps-D and repeatedly seeing that item you cannot execute may become annoying. <br><br>As you said putting a tickler in Outlook Calendar or similar, to prompt you to readd that task is the recommended way.<br><br>However, per <a rel="nofollow" href="http://github.com/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/issues#issue/9">http://github.com/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/issues#issue/9</a> "Tickler implementation", entering a task into AFAHK today that will only add itself into the current list at a future date and future expiry would be great. <br><br>I'm thinking your current A20100212085753 (and similar) date added field in tasks.txt, could be T20100312085753 . When that date comes, change that field to become  A20100312085753 and then only caps-D will display it. We could have caps-T for tickler entry, or just have the caps-A "More" button display a "Future add date" field. I prefer the latter, but you might have a better tickler interface design. <br><br>BTW, I notice AutofocusAHK.ini have "[DWM] ExpirationNew=28" records, but that appears not to be effective, since caps-A give expiry of one calendar month currently.<br><br>Thanks again, Andreas for the hardwork on this tool. ;-)<br><br>PS: The timer said I spent 40mins on this post.
