These days I have no special dismissal process, just working through a one-column notebook in any order I want—remedial notebook learning! I have ended up with a few active pages, a few recent-but-growing-stale pages, and a bunch of pages that are effectively dismissed because I rarely visit them (and don't need to).

The feel is quite different, and I'm asking myself whether increasing the number of lines might solve some of the problems associated with AF1.<br><br>It's easy enough to implement. If you have a smaller notebook, just treat facing pages as one page. That immediately doubles the number.

Thanks so much for sharing your systems with us.  Superfocus has helped me enormously over the last six months in dealing with several serious illnesses and bereavements in my close family, and a few other crises besides.  I can't say I've followed it faithfully every day, and there were many days when I didn't even use it,  but it has kept things as much under control as was possible in the trying circumstances, and just opening up my SF notebook and reading through it brought me a sense of calm and peace amid the chaos.  I think I'll follow AF1 for a while to see how it suits me now, having tried all the various systems.  I didn't really apply the column 2 rules of Superfocus very stringently, and the great simplicity of AF1 appeals to me right now.  All the best to you  and the other forum members.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 August 2011 at 9:11 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm amazed you find AF1 so wonderful, and it makes me think you must have very few priority items come up during the day. The one thing I found disconcerting to me about AF4 was that I wanted to focus on these priority items but after working one or two of the biggest out of the closed list, it took a while to get back to those now in the open list. <br><br>The best thing AF1 has going is simplicity in practice, which SF lost. But still, it seems to lack a healthy way of dealing with items like laundry unless you cycle the list extremely fast or have another technique. I mean: laundry comes up.  Throw clothes in wash.  Great! But will you get a reminder to throw them into the dryer? AF4 with two lists did.  SF with optional tasks does. Anyway what goes for laundry is 5x desired for priority work tasks, where I need to keep the few items going over and over. "I'll get back to them after looping through 5 other pages" would be frustration. <br><br>My point is, I know I can do my own thing, but it seems to me your life must be very slow paced for AF1 to be so successful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 August 2011 at 13:20 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>One of the things which is interesting to analyse while working with AF1 is which part of the list you spend most time working on. Generally speaking, most time is spent working on the last two pages of the list. <br><br>There are two reasons for this:<br><br>1) The last two pages tend to have a greater proportion of unactioned tasks than earlier pages.<br><br>2) Once you have finished working on the penultimate page, the next page may either have become or be on the point of becoming the penultimate page. "Working on the last two pages" may in fact involve working on three, four or more pages as the end of the list keeps moving in the same direction as you are.<br><br>Now where do you find most "priority items that come up in the course of the day"?<br><br>On the last two pages.<br><br>This is why sticking to the rules of AF1 results in much less of a problem with priority tasks than would at first appear.<br><br>There will be occasions when you really do need to do something before you can get to it in the normal course of working the list. In that case you simply invoke the "if it needs doing now, do it now" rule. But my experience is that if I trust the system that happens far less often than one would think.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 August 2011 at 15:21 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>Further to the above, a look at the tasks I have done so far today bears out what I said:<br><br>Page 1 - 4<br>Page 2 - 6<br>Page 3 - 8<br>Page 4 - 13<br>Page 5 - 28<br><br>I tried to find an equivalent on my list of your "I need to keep the few items going over and over".

For my work efforts, I have always used OneNote, and the mode of operation was always to *move* tasks rather than cross them out and re-enter them.  Under AF4 rules, this form difference didn't matter.  In SF, I noticed this factor really messed with the column 2 counts, and it was a real pain to properly track the "true" count for that column.  As for column 1, the moving tasks didn't really matter because I knew what was closed, and important tasks always followed me around in C2 anyway.<br><br>With AF1, this theory is completely out the window.  Where you get your last page growing and growing even with reentry, I would just be reorganizing that last page list.

Rather than rewrite an item, I move it to the end.  Not because I want to be contrarian, but because it fits the medium easier.  Works brilliant.  But with AF1, where you get several new pages at the end, I get only one, because deleting shrinks the list and reentry doesn't grow it.

Perhaps this is only my problem, but i haven't noticed a significant drop in drift activity since using Dreams. And yet, I don't want to resort to rules/list making. AFs always felt PUSH-ish to me... regardless of what was on the list.

I've been closing each new "page" at the end of each day.   I find the exact number of items allowed on a page to be far less important than a clear, simple mechanism for closing the page, and preserving the "number of active tasks on each page shrinking progressively" effect.<br><br>The same applies to my "accordion files on a shelf" system -- each accordion file holds a different number of items, depending on what those items are.  I just keep stuffing each one till it's full, and then I "close" the folder, don't add anything new to it, and add a new folder at the end of the shelf.  It's usually 20-30 items.  If it's all paper mail and scraps of paper with "to-do's" on them, each folder can hold 30-70 items.  If I throw in a new package of socks that I don't want to unpack right now, that fills the accordion folder pretty quickly.  :-)   I've found it really doesn't matter so much as long as (1) I do close the folder in some systematic way, and (2) each time I process a folder, the number of items remaining gets smaller.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2011 at 2:41 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark &amp; Alan,<br>&lt;&lt; re investments, I only know stocks are considered aggressive and risky. I would talk to a financial planner about what's more conservative and fitting your situation. &gt;&gt;<br><br>A diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, real estate, and hard assets, with a buy-and-hold strategy, might be called the AF1 of investing: simple, not flashy, but tried &amp; true. When stocks fall, other asset classes are likely to stay even or to rise. When you need to generate cash, you can often find *something* to sell that has had a net gain, so that you are taking a profit. Yesterday, amid the depressing stock news, I took profits in bonds to raise cash for next year. My stocks are down, so I won't be selling them for a while. Mostly, I ignore the financial news.<br><br>Buying stocks and bonds is straightforward on the markets. Lesser known but still widely available are REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and various funds that hold a stake in hard assets such as oil and gold. REITs have the advantage of paying a quarterly dividend and have been an excellent performer for me this past decade. A financial planner can guide you through all this, and the good ones are well worth their fee. Mine receives a tiny percentage of my *total* portfolio value annually, meaning that he can double his income by doubling my assets (and those of his other clients). I like that arrangement!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2011 at 2:42 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There are lots of ways to save &amp; invest for one's future rather than trusting to a random number generator cleverly disguised as a shell game:<br><br>- Keeping a good stock (1 year's worth?) of food, water, medical and other tangible supplies on hand.  Of course you need to have space for all this.  So, invest in the space if you don't have it. <br><br>- "Portable wealth" (as per Charles Dickens' Great Expectations) - physical gold &amp; silver - might not have as much growth potential as stocks in normal economic times - but who knows when we'll return to normal economic times?<br><br>- Real estate - become a landlord - which is really a job, not an investment<br><br>- Real estate - invest in a private REIT - the REIT pays someone to do the landlording<br><br>- Real estate - invest in a publicly traded REIT - downside - you get the same random-number-generator issues as the Stock Market<br><br>- More liquid versions of portable wealth - gold &amp; silver ETFs<br><br>- Other commodities, such as oil, and their proxies, such as oil ETFs<br><br>- At least put some money in the currency of other countries, as a hedge, especially if gold &amp; silver seem too barbaric to you.  You can do this easily through ETFs.  See <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.currencyshares.com">http://www.currencyshares.com</a> for example.  <br><br>- Caveat: all ETFs, even for currencies and commodities, tend to fall in the random-number-generator camp.   When these things are all put on a "portfolio" list they tend to look like a bunch of horses competing in a race, together with stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.   Probably more useful to keep them in distinctly different mental categories.<br><br>- Invest in building a community network - know your neighbors - know the spokes of the neighborhood and local networks - know the people who know people - if you really fall on hard times, you'll have a network of people to help you get through it - this is a way to build your own luck, another resource on which to fall if needed - through churches, community organizations, political organizations, or whatever catches your interest<br><br>- If you still decide to keep a lot of money in self-managed stocks/bonds etc., at least learn to use options to do some hedging.   A great online broker for this is www.thinkorswim.com - they provide lots of free educational resources, training courses, etc.   They are US-based; I don't know if they have a Europe-based equivalent.<br><br><br>Some other online resources along these lines are as follows:<br>- Dorsey Wright - a data service for brokers that provides a sound methodology for gauging markets and investing - ask them for referrals to investment advisors in your state or country - <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://dorseywright.com/">http://dorseywright.com/</a><br><br>- Jim Garbor and Sean Balog - Investment advisors in Arizona who follow to Dorsey Wright methodologies - <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.garberbalog.wfadv.com/">http://www.garberbalog.wfadv.com/</a><br><br>- Porter Stansberry / Steve Sjuggarud - Investment newsletters with an excellent track record - not all stock-oriented - especially Sjuggarud's True Wealth newsletter - and a fairly broad variety of niche newsletters for people in particular situations - but look out for the constant onslaught of new offerings they try to sell you.  <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.stansberryresearch.com/">http://www.stansberryresearch.com/</a><br><br>- I like books by Jim Rogers (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rogers)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rogers)</a> as a theoretical backdrop to all this.

We had a lengthy discussion on this a few months back, in the context of SuperFocus.    It can really change the system dynamics.<br><br>Back in AF1 days, I did try a few different approaches here -- pocket notebook (~20 lines per page) and graph-paper notebook (~50 lines per page).<br><br>I liked having more lines per page.  I can see more context in one glance that way.  It also gives me more choices when I visit a page -- which keeps the motivation higher.   It also helped to cycle through the overall list more quickly -- which was always a problem for me.<br><br>Imagine a notebook with 5 items per page.   If any of those items are high-resistance, you will be forced to do some work on them very quickly, without much of the frequent repeated exposure that AF applies to break down the resistance.   <br><br>But imagine a notebook with 1000 items per page.   It would function like a big open list most of the time, not giving you any of the benefits of the AF processing rules.   You might NEVER be forced to take action on the high-resistance items.  They might become irrelevant by the time you are forced to take action or dismiss them.  <br><br>Obviously the optimum number of items per page is somewhere between 5 and 1000.   <br><br>Mark - What are your key observations regarding an increased number of items per page?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2011 at 3:49 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan Baljeu wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; re AF1.

But I waste a tremendous amount of space on mostly-blank 2nd columns.  (I use a 28-line pocket notebook with right-side pages functioning as C2. I'm currently on p. 18 and all the C2 entries so far would fit together on half of one page!)  So I might revert back to AF1 as well when it's time for a new notebook.  The "common-sense" rule of AF1 could be used liberally to handle more-frequent action on unfinished tasks, as well as dealing with urgent tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2011 at 20:55 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ubi:<br><br>"But I waste a tremendous amount of space on mostly-blank 2nd columns.

However, I've found that I vastly prefer my small 5x7 notebooks (24 lines to a page), vastly prefer to use the full page width (only one column), and find it annoying to write on both sides of the page (although I really wanted to like the facing-page setup). Call me picky, but I have found a way out:<br><br>Take each pair of pages (regular, civilized, full-width, one-side-of-the-paper pages!) as one "AF page." Keep your place by writing an "A" or "B," alternately, at the top of each page (regular page, not AF page). Then, each A-B pair is dismissed when nothing stands out on either page, while actioning any item on either page is sufficient to keep both pages (the "AF page") active.<br><br>If that sounded complicated, then forget all that and just think "each pair of pages is one page."<br><br>Processing these page-pairs? To follow AF1 strictly, one would scan both pages and then look for a stand-out, but I imagine it would be fine to scan each page in turn; if nothing stands out on A, then flip to B.<br><br>This could extend to page triplets or quads if one wants even more lines per page, but I wonder how soon that would become cumbersome.<br><br>SuperFocus users could label their pages C1 and C2 instead of A and B. As new pages are added at the end, alternate pages (C2) would be left blank to be filled in later. This would actually reinforce the rules in those variations calling for a strict C1/C2 processing order. One could also use a triplet of, say two C1's in a row, followed by a C2. That would double the effective page size without changing the rate of forced dismissals (when C2 fills up). I guess this is equivalent to blocking off the lower half of every C2 in advance, so it will fill up prematurely. Conversely, one could let pages survive longer by creating two C2's between every C1.<br><br>All theoretical at this point, but I am still on my first page of a fresh AF1, so it is not too late to write an "A" up top!

And write normally on odd pages (same side as front cover). So when I open flat the even/odd facing pages, it looks like one long list.
