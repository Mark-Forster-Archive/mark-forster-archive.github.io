As most of my time is taken up with non-AF routines and appointments, I am struggling to get through all the pages once. Let me be clear that I am still very happy with the system. It is working beautifully for me. I'm not panicking about not working through every page as each evening I search the entire list for tasks that must be completed the next day. <br><br>What I am wondering, though, is:<br><br>1)Is anyone else having this experience?<br><br>2) Is my list going to keep growing to the point that it will become ineffective?<br><br>One thing to note is that my page 1 had lots of big projects on it. Later lists have not as many. <br><br>I'm interested in your thoughts!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2009 at 0:05 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My experience has been similar (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/634184).">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/634184).</a>  I'm up to 40 active pages now....  <br><br>Tracking some simple metrics has helped me a lot -- how many tasks did I complete today, versus how many new tasks did I write down today.  I kept hoping for them to balance out, and to reach an equilibrium, or perhaps for the total number of open tasks to actually start decreasing.  And I have finally hit that point where it seems to be at an equilibrium -- at around 750 open tasks!  <br><br>For me, that's very encouraging.  I was actually expecting it to keep climbing up into the thousands, and was beginning to get discouraged.  750 is a much more manageable number.  It does go up and down now, but still seems to stay around that level.<br><br>So now, a new task on my AF list is to brainstorm about reducing that number, so I can move more quickly through the list.  Some initial ideas:<br><br>- Move "someday/maybe" items to a side list, and then have 1 AF task that says "review someday/maybe items"<br><br>- Copy over fewer items from previous systems -- bring over only a few at a time, or maybe on days when I haven't added many new tasks -- or just do this less frequently.<br><br>- Throw more items into my "tickler" file, so they don't clutter up the main AF list until they are really actionable. (The tickler file is a dated accordion file, with sections for days of the month, and for future months.  So, if I don't need to do something till March, I throw it in the March section.)  I have an AF item already for checking the tickler file pretty regularly.<br><br>- Make fewer commitments.  I have a lot of irons in the fire.  It's actually a lot of fun, but maybe it's not realistic to be trying to do so many things.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2009 at 3:43 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel<br><br>My experience is as close to yours as I think is possible - I am also on page 22 with no dismissed items, pages that are close to being completed and have the same problem with days where getting through even one page is a challenge.  My page 1 also had big projects (later pages fewer).  I do feel on top of things though and try to do a quick scan of all pages on a regular basis just to keep tabs on them .......</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2009 at 21:39 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I finally dismissed a page today!

I'm cycling very slowly through my lists at present as I am deep in my "major backlog project" this week - and really enjoying it - weird or what?!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 0:47 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel,<br><br>Are you doing anything on those early pages?  If so, tasks should be migrating to later pages and be crossed off on the early ones ... which would help them close out.  If you are not doing anything on those early pages, why are those tasks not being dismissed?<br><br>The list is designed to maintain itself in that it forces us to work on tasks or flushes them out of the system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 9:32 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v><br>How to *really* to do dismissing? It seems little bit vague... maybe i didn't understand that from first instructions<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 9:59 | Ralph</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ralph,<br><br>If you come back to a page and don't find ANYTHING on that page that you want to do, then ALL items on that page are "dismissed".  You highlight them and mark the page as "inactive" and don't go back to it any more.<br><br>So your page may have most items crossed off because they were competed (or started and moved to another page for further work).  You may have hit that page many times, but each previous time you did at least ONE item on the page.  Eventually, you MUST cross off all items or decide you are not going to do the last few so you are forced to dismiss them.  If you have 30 items on a page, you might visit that page 30 times (at most) to get all 30 done.  But you really can't visit it more than that.  If you have 29 items done and on the 30th time through you decide not to do the last, it is dismissed!<br><br>Of course, you can do multiple items per page review, but you get the idea.  The number of items on the page is the maximum number of times you really should visit that page if you do only one item each time.<br><br>You may decide at some later date to go back and review your closed pages and "reactivate" some of those dismissed items.  To do that you just add them to the end of your list and they re-enter the system and are done or possibly dismissed again because they wound up not getting acted on.<br><br>Dismissing items is crucial to the working of AF.  If you don't do it, you'll never close pages and they will grow until they get big and mean and attack you in your sleep!  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 10:22 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, thanks for clarification!

This means I have the following choices: do both items; do one of the items and leave the other for the next visit to the page; or do neither of the items and dismiss both of them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 14:53 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, yes I am doing at least one thing on every page that I work on. My problem is I don't have enough unstructured time to get through every page every day. It's definitely my goal though and I'm on my fourth day in a row of doing more tasks than I add to the list. That's progress. I am up to 24 pages of tasks but only have 1 item left on my first page. I should be closing out several pages this week.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2009 at 4:25 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel,<br><br>It seems that the number of open pages stabilizes at some number that is unique to you and your situation.  IOW, eventually you will be doing as many items as you are adding .. which implies a stable backlog.  I think that the advantage to AF is that the backlog is under continual review so does not continue to grow or to get too old.<br><br>I think it takes a while for this to level out, though.  There are many variables such as fluxuating free time, differences in the granularity and/or difficulty of the items, etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2009 at 14:06 | Mike</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
