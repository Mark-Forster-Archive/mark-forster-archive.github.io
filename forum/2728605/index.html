Please post your sheet as I would really like to take a look at it. Although I've tried a strategy similar to yours of using small timeboxes and incrementally raising the time.

Right now all you can see is "I hate Math" and you're trying to find a way around that thought. But that thought is just a thought -- it feels real because you're pushing so much emotion behind it, but it's not a Thing the way my cup of coffee is a Thing.

Here are some things that I have found helpful:<br><br>Self-compassion: Sit with your feelings about math and the test. It's probably a minefield. Many studies have shown that compassion for yourself help us to do better. It's a tricky balance. Compassion is not pitty. It's not saying woe is me, it's just sitting with someone who is in pain. It can make the rest of your studying much more effective.<br><br>Depending on what comes up when you sit with your discomfort, this might be a long-term approach.<br><br>Self care. If the studying isn't going to happen, use that time for something else.<br><br>S.T.R.E.S.S analysis: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2674568">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2674568</a><br>This method is used by the local ADHD and Asperger's Center, and I think it applies for everyone. It helps break down what's behind the resistance. Sometimes you discover something easy to deal with, sometimes something that's more complex.<br><br>Plan Z. Forget plans B and C, what is plan Z? This is also known as catastrophizing. What is the worst that will happen if you fail the test? Will you be kicked out of school? Will your entire future be ruined? Check with your undergrad advisor. Many schools have counselors who know the options for each program. It's like shining a flashlight in the darkness. Once we know what's there, we know what to prepare for, and usually we discover it's not as bad as we feared, and there are often concrete things we can do about it.<br><br>May you be well.

I was having trouble with the basic definition of a "task" being either an action or a project as defined by GTD, that I just couldn't really get to the algorithm part.  But now that I'm over the task definition hurdle, I think I'd like to give this a try.  I'm noticed some resistance creeping into my simple scanning over the past week.  Some tasks I'm having a hard time moving on that I usually found time for in the past.<br><br>I have a good digital list going right now.  Has there been any discussion on how to use radomizing with scanning with one long list with no pages?  I like the idea of a physical die to use for randomization, just for fun.

I found a 120-sided die online that looks intriguing. Is this suitable for my list with 210 lines of uncrossed and crossed-off tasks? &gt;&gt;<br><br>The pages and the crossed-out tasks are key elements in the Randomizer-with-sliding method. They allow you to clear out older pages more quickly. This mechanism puts a bias on older tasks. This is important to the dynamics of the system. Even though the tasks are selected randomly, it really feels like you are making strong progress, and resistance drops to zero.<br><br>I tried doing something similar on a pageless electronic system. <br><br>First, I needed to make sure there was a way to keep completed tasks on the page (crossed out or visible in some way). Many task apps allow you to do this. If your app doesn't, then maybe you can replace the task with an empty task or a "-" mark or something.<br><br>Second, you need some kind of mechanism to stay on a "page". I simply set up my screen to show a constant number of tasks (say, 20) on the screen. <br><br>That worked pretty well but was kind of annoying if I accidentally scrolled down the page or something.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2018 at 1:29 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There's a lot of great discussion about the size of dice to use, etc., in the comments on Mark's original post on the Randomizer system.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2018 at 1:31 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cameron:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I'm noticed some resistance creeping into my simple scanning over the past week.
