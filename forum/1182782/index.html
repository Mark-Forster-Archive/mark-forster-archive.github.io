This might surprise you, but it’s actually a big time management mistake many people make. Instead of working from your complete to-do list, it's crucial to set a top priority list with a maximum of six to eight items on the list. Set this priority list at the end of each day for the next day. You should work from this priority list, working on item one first until finished then move to item number two. Keep your to do list separate and complete items on this list when you have finished items on your priority list. Also, use your to do list as a way to remember what you MIGHT want to put on your priority list.<br><br>02 Checking emails constantly throughout the day. The biggest problem with this is that it interrupts what you are working on. Every time you are interrupted, you lose momentum and focus. Instead, check your emails in 20-30 minute blocks one to three times per day.<br><br>03 Becoming distracted by elements on your computer, for example email notifications that pop up when you get new emails.<br><br>04 Multi-tasking – doing too many things at one time and half completing all of them. This is much less effective than doing one thing at a time and completing each item before moving to the next. Every time you change to another task you lose momentum and focus. Instead, focus in solid blocks of time from 50 minutes to two hours. Multi-tasking is okay for easy activities such as driving and listening to an educational audio program at the same time, but for anything that requires complex thought, you need to focus on one task at a time. The biggest problem is leaving many tasks incomplete. Multi-tasking is actually okay when you complete each item that you are working on then move to the next, but then that wouldn’t really be “multi-tasking” if you complete each task!<br><br>05 Working in an environment where you are prone to being interrupted by other people, phone calls etc. If other people come in and interrupt you constantly, this will be a big time waster. Your train of thought, momentum and flow are interrupted and you won’t be able to focus on your priorities.<br><br>06 Starting your day by checking your emails. This can be a huge distraction. Instead, start your day with the top priority on your daily priority list.<br><br>07 Keeping emails in your inbox. If you keep emails in your inbox, you will likely read the same email five times before you action it. Your inbox is not meant to be your to do list. Instead, try to handle all emails when you read them. Either delete it, archive it, delegate it, action it quickly or if you can’t finish the task at the time of reading the email, archive your email and put the action on your to do list. Keeping your inbox clear will also help you to keep your mind clearer and more focused.<br><br>More articles at TimeManagement articles at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/dz8fiJ.">http://bit.ly/dz8fiJ.</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2010 at 1:30 | sapphire</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There's definitely some truth in these rules, but the problem with hard and fast rules of time management is that they are generalizations and break down eventually.   I really like Mark Forster's Autofocus system which lets you work the way you feel like working.  Work on tasks that pull you instead of push on tasks.  I've only seen Mark really elucidate this concept and make it work via a really easy methodology.  Personally, I would have difficulty consistently focusing on "solid blocks of time from 50 minutes to two hours."  I just don't have that many uninterrupted blocks of time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2010 at 2:29 | Paul B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with your list.  01 is more more efficient and focused than recycling through one's Autofocus or To Do list time after time to pick out a thing to work on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2010 at 2:37 | Djorn</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm currently dealing with newborn baby-itiis. But when normalcy returns (when he's 12), I will keep on using my hybrid ZTD &amp; DWM. Every night I pick out my Most Important Tasks for the next day (1 related to my MAJOR goal, 2 related to work/hobby). I also date all my tasks, projects, etc a la DWM. I allow the pressure of "assembly line" and dismissal to keep things fresh.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2010 at 5:31 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum - You might be surprised if you are expecting normalcy to return when your little one turns 12.  I'm not sure if "normalcy" EVER returns!  :-)    (maybe that's the true normalcy?)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2010 at 5:51 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with the rules except theses :<br>01. I take time to mark with a dash each task i must do on my af4 list. I dont extract them. I noticed that my mind focus on the task. Following mf rule 1 - read the all list with no intention of doing - push me to do the most important thing at the right time. Extracting task is for me a real perturbation.<br>05 working in a difficult environement is easy for me because of Af4. I can be interupted i know i will finish mywork quietly and efficiently. The only thing wich could be a perturbation for me would be a hurricane ! Lol.<br>06 email at the beginning of my day. I dont agree at all.<br>Reading and eliminating email 3 times a day morning, after lunch and at the end of the day make a real sense about my priorities. Thanks to af4 during the day i will follow the traffic and be quiet about urgencies. I notocied that many client send me emails very late 12 pm 2 am 3 am why? Then i am sure that i did not forget anything. <br>07 email in my inbox yes and no<br>Yes if they are not treated. No if they are not actionable at a very shrt time. I found<br> an easy way to manage things when sometime i have to many emails i want to keep i just drag them in my 2010 emails folders without any classification in sub folders then i have a clean inbox. Often 1 time a day or a week i work on my 2010 folder and eliminates all doubles. If if need to find info i just do a search in this folder. Then i can take some parts of emails. I archive this email box each year and let it in my email system until nothing is actionable.<br>Hope this help.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2010 at 9:32 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My comments on this advertisement would be:<br><br>01. The problem with picking a short list of 6 to 8 top priority items is that it reduces flexibility, makes it more difficult to respond to urgent work, and doesn't give you a way of integrating the small but necessary tasks that we all have to do. In fact it's subject to all the problems of prioritising by importance that I outline on this website's Home page <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/">http://www.markforster.net/</a><br><br>02 and 03. I agree. I've been saying this for years.<br><br>04. Solid blocks of 50 minutes to 2 hours may be good for tackling a particularly intractable problem, sorting a major project or for things like music practice. But for routine work they are far too long for most people to keep to, and are likely to result in getting nothing done because they produce feelings of resistance.<br><br>05. I agree with this as desirable. But what if working in that environment *is* your work?<br><br>06 and 07. Agree as general principles.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2010 at 10:06 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another major mistake people seem to make is not pruning/weeding stale items on their to do list, something that AF and DWM handles very well.<br><br>&lt;The problem with picking a short list of 6 to 8 top priority items is that it reduces flexibility, makes it more difficult to respond to urgent work, and doesn't give you a way of integrating the small but necessary tasks that we all have to do&gt;<br><br>Personally I find it easier to respond to urgent work with a daily focus list, anything comes up can be added to the list and dealt with at any point later in the day. <br><br>The smaller/less urgent stuff then goes on the normal list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2010 at 21:40 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I indeed agree with smilepete. Putting all in af has the advantage of managingthe all stuff in a sole coherent system. Dealing with urgency in af4 is indeed easy just go to your activ list, begin to read from the end of it to the botum andyou will have the last entries which often are the most urgent. Example imagine you have a call from aclient he wish you send him some doc and a proposal. If it is short just write in af4 send client x doc 1,2,3<br>And onanother line send to client x proposal aboutproject x <br>You then know doc is urgent <br>You know proposal will take time <br>If you decide to take a long timeto make the proposal just goto your diary and put on tomorrow make proposal client x . The go back to f 4 and put 30th nd a x at the end of your task you know that you will do it tomorrow. Then urgent and important things are treated. Af4 manage the all of it and youcan feel peacefull and quiet, open to new opportunities. <br>Hope thathelps. <br>Cheers</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2010 at 11:50 | Jupiter</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
