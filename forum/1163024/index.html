I have read some of Mark's books and a lot of info on this website.  My dliemma is that I have a number of 'topic areas' or customers or projects (whatever you want to call them).  When I tried to put them all into one AF list it all got very jumbled up and I had a real problem picking out what I needed to do for each customer. I even tried writing each one in a different coloured ink and that was a bit mind blowing!<br><br>I'm taking on another large customer shortly and don't want to 'drop the ball' so am looking at a better way of managing my tasks.  I want to record them all so I don't forget (I get a lot of emails from customer with various comments and instructions and it's easy to forget or lose something).<br><br>Would you create a separate list for each one?  I have about 4-5 main customers/areas of work - none of which have anything in common or overlap. Your help or any tips or examples would be much appreciated.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 July 2010 at 17:09 | Holly Young</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think I'd have one list for each client, and on the AF list have "review/work on list for Client1" "review/work on list for Client2" etc. And put deadlines on a calendar or something to be sure you don't miss them</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 July 2010 at 17:23 | Lillian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's right.  One AF list, and that list references each client.  The client pages may be any format, including lists, but you don't run them as independent AF lists.  Rather, run the AF list, and when you see client1 on your AF list, you may look at the client1 page and choose something, anything to work on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 July 2010 at 18:42 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would agree with the thought that each client gets a list, which you can process using the AF method if you want.  I would then have a separate AF list for non-client work that needs to be tracked which may include a simple list of your clients, no need to keep rewriting the list of clients and the individual list of clients will track the tasks.  Just reviewing the list of clients may be enough for your mind to get you thinking about which client has pressing matters and enable you to prioritize which client list to jump into.<br><br>A while back I wrote an article called project focus which takes the AF method of processing and applies it to those dealing with projects.  A few people liked it.  It is on my website if you want to look at it.<br><br>Gerry<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 July 2010 at 20:50 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Definitely use a separate place to hold project plans and such for each client!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2010 at 10:41 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very helpful - thank you.

Take time to work on each project. What is the outcome ? How to succeed ? What are the steps ? What tasks do you have to do ? <br>Then i would write on AF work on client X and i would check  tasks on the project until i am fed up. Then I would write on AF work on client 2 and do the same. I would reformulate the steps little by little one client by one client in AF. So my method would be a mixt of GTD and AF but for these kind of project i really dont know how i could avoid doing things like this. <br>Cheers <br><br>Jupiter</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2010 at 16:57 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Jupiter. I'm now building my list for each customer/project so should be up and running with it by tomorrow.  Thanks for all your help everyone!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2010 at 23:26 | Holly Young</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The question I still wonder is do you need 2 note books one for yours projects and one for AF.  I tried the first method but little by little I noticed that it was better to have most of my tasks project grouped in AF. <br><br>these 2 methods have advantages and disadvantages. Grouping stuff when there are no too many projects aloud s a better focus and is even simplest. If you have a lot of clients or projects you could put them in a binder with a A&gt;Z classification. And put some blank sheets at the beginning for general AF tasks . <br><br>Using AF and GTD for quiet a long time i noticed some golden unavoidable rules. One is to keep all main active info in one place even it is not easy. Thats is why i still use 2 notes books one for my notes about projects and one for AF and a project list and a someday may be list some where. The waiting list seems to be un useful because @Wait tasks can be included in AF high-lined with a different color such as green and completed with a date in the marge. <br><br>Anyway there is no perfect system. ORGANIZING YOUR LISTS is something you must feel and you will find by yourself what is better for you. I would only suggest to make it simple. I don(t agree with David Allen when he says that if things are complicated the system must be too. I think at the opposite that most of our decision are taken very shortly and intuitively. So your task system is just a memory support which lets your intuition and reason choose the best thing to do at the right time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2010 at 15:08 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter,<br><br>The other option people mentioned is simply a loose leaf binder with a projects section and either subtabs for projects notes behind the project's list or a notes section.  There are even two subject spiral noteboks that would work.<br><br>I agree complicated systems are to be avoided, they just rarely are kept up. Look at things like building the Golden Gate Bridge, no computers yet an engineering marvel was created.<br><br>Gerry<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2010 at 15:58 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is what I have decided to do - sort of prompted by one of my big customers who I do a lot of work for and who has asked for a weekly list of outstanding tasks:<br><br>1. Create a list for either each customer or project. So I will have a list for customer X which I can share with him and a list for project Y, and so on for all customers and projects. <br><br>2. Have an AF list which contains ad hoc tasks, and a list of both customers and projects.<br><br>3. Work the AF list, and when I get to customer X or project Y, check that list and pick something to work on.<br><br>The benefit to me of this is that the AF list will be kept much shorter and this I will find easier to manage. My projects/customers tend to have some longevity to them so don't get dismissed as often as other people's tasks, but this will work OK.<br><br>I have a very attractive filofax and have now got a 10 part index to put into it, and have a daily diary in the front. 10 sections is plenty for AF + customers/projects.  I use outlook diary on a daily basis (things often get moved around so this is convenient and I can also sync with my iPhone). I will put AF and customer/projects into individual sections at the back of this filofax.  This means I can check my AF list at the start of every day and bring 3-4 tasks into my daily diary page to do, then when I have done them I can cross them off and go get some more.<br><br>The outcome is that I will have a list for each project customer, I have control over AF, I end up with a list of my activity to give satisfaction at the end of the day, and it all sits in one place - my filofax (I have an A5 one so it has plenty of room to do all this).<br><br>Wish me luck!  I am aboutbhalf way through setting this up - I keep having to some work in between setting it all up!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2010 at 17:22 | Holly Young</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Holly. It's quiet funny because I just transferred my AF list on my Old Mulberry. It's the ancestor of the filofax a red one with a lot of divider I noticed this happen when things are getting so complicated or when i feel overwhelmed. The real advantage of it is having in the same place my AF lists (professional/personal and someday may be list) a project divider, a company divider, a customer divider (practical for my calls) a reference divider for projects notes, summary and check list. For the little history I bought it about 25 years ago. There was no computer i was working in a small real estate company and i had many things to do for my boss. As i needed my infos any where i brought it with me every where. Then years later arrived computer we thought this would change the world. There would be no paper left. I just noticed that things became more and more complicated except for sending documents and smart emails. So as I had not a lot of AF pages and all my essential infos in folders i just begin to report them in my "filofax" as a current initiative little by little. I hope to obtain a better control of my infos and work more easily for my spiral note books is a bit difficult to manage sometimes. My "filofax" let me more easily create some close list that i can put in my dividers and it seems easier. Wait and see</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2010 at 17:52 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Of course i always use AF4....</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2010 at 17:54 | Jupiter</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
