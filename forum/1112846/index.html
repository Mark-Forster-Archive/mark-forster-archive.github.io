I find (and I'm sure I'm not alone in this) that I myself procrastinate for different reasons, depending on the situation. This can make it much harder to tackle the procrastination, since at any given point I need to have enough self-awareness to know what is causing me to procrastinate before I can do anything about it.<br><br>For me these are the things I have identified:<br><br>- I typically start procrastinating by worrying that what I produce won't be good enough (a sort of 'unproductive perfectionism')<br>- next, if the work is being done for someone else, I start to feel guilty/ashamed/embarrassed that I've still not got it done, and procrastinate to avoid these feelings<br>- then part of me starts to feel resentful about these feelings, and by extension my job, and it becomes a sort of 'demand-resistance' procrastination about anything I'm expected to do<br>- eventually when the pressure of the backlog of work gets too much I try to start on it, but at that point start to procrastinate because I am feeling completely overwhelmed.<br><br>In addition to these main points there can be other factors:<br><br>- tiredness (I am a fairly new Dad and am also trying to train myself in web design in the evenings)<br>- demotivation, brought on by questioning if my work is really achieving anything<br>- lack of focus - distraction by non-work-related things, either worries about house, family, money etc or excitement about something positive happening<br>- resistance to a task which I would always find inherently unpleasant, for whatever reason (e.g. for me, anything involving confrontation)<br><br>In the past I've always tried to narrow it down to one simple thing - (e.g. *this* is why I *really* procrastinate) and of course very quickly end up procrastinating again for a different reason, and end up feeling depressed and hopeless that I could change...<br><br>Sorry for the rant - just interested to know really if this experience resonated with anyone else?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 May 2010 at 10:18 | Daniel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Daniel,<br><br>Absolutely.  I think we all tend to favor one particular mode of procrastination ... but that is probably just out of habit and lifestyle.  It might be that as a new dad you are more inclined to be overwhelmed than before, but the progression you describe is something I've experienced.  It is good that you have also identified the reasons for each type so that you can become more alert to how things are likely to be in different situations.  The next step, I would suggest is to have a corresponding list of strategies for each type.<br><br>Also, realize that procrastination can serve as a message that you should not be doing something in the first place.  If you are wondering about the value of your work, maybe that is a message to change what you are doing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 May 2010 at 11:36 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for your reply Mike! In response to your last comment, you may have something there, but I've changed career twice in the past four years, each time with a corresponding knock-down in pay. Which wouldn't have bothered me when I was single, but as a husband and father now, I feel I really need to make a success of this (and I don't always feel demotivated, and I think I'd always question the value of my chosen career path, *whatever* I was doing. I am at least moderately interested in this career path, even if not burning with enthusiasm).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 May 2010 at 11:49 | Daniel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Daniel,<br><br>Although I haven't studied my procrastination habit much, your post could have been written by me.  It describes my feelings and procrastination causes precisely. <br><br>Next up: Develop some strategies.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 May 2010 at 12:57 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;Develop some strategies&gt;&gt;<br><br>To date - the only strategy that works for me is accountability. A coach, therapist, creative muse and/or deadline. A combination of deadline and partner-in-crime works best. Online forums are nice, but I don't find they provide enough carrot or stick.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 May 2010 at 14:17 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum,<br><br>And that is the one strategy that will absolutely NOT work for me.  Basically because my form of procrastination is the rebellion against authority.  So you can see where having "accountability" is exactly what will trigger or make procrastination worse, for me.<br><br>Over on my list some people wanted to set up something like that and began to "remind" me of a project I said was simple but was procrastinating about (for some other reason).  But once I began to get "how's it going?" questions, I could feel the rebellion taking control.  "Who are THEY to tell me what to do?"  It had nothing to do with the people, or the way the questions were posed, it was simply that some external force was holding me accountable and that was enough to assure that the project would NEVER get done.<br><br>In my own case, the standard "chunking down" works when overwhelm is in play, and when it is rebellion, I need to find my OWN reason for WANTING to do it and I need to amplify that feeling.  What also works well is getting something done which gives me the feeling that it is simple to get more done..  Different techniques for different people and different problems.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 May 2010 at 16:41 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Daniel,<br><br>I enjoyed reading your post. I go through the same stages, though not necessarily in that order. <br><br>As far as I am concerned, DWM is the best solution. I am not saying it's the only thing. But it is very good. I still procrastinate, and I still get down on myself for procrastinating. But I am also learning to be more self-accepting.<br><br>"Procrastination" is a tricky term. Years ago, on another forum, I learned from a poster that it's OK not to work every second I am at my workplace. If I spend two days doing nothing but surfing, I would get very down on myself, and, no doubt, feel highly motivated to get a lot done on the third day. But is it the end of the world if one day I spend 2 hours surfing? Sometimes I discover amazing things on the internet. Like Mark Forster.<br><br>What I like about DWM is that it keeps me more honest than anything else I've done before. As long as I consciously decide to surf by writing down in DWM first, I seem to stay on track most of the time. Yes, I sometimes use items on my DWM list to avoid other items on my DWM list. But, I can't do that for too long.<br><br>I don't think any system changes me qualitatively, immediately. But a 10-15% improvement here and there builds up over time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 May 2010 at 18:08 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Daniel, <br><br>Either beg, buy, borrow or steal a copy of the book I mentioned in the previous thread, Self -Discipline in 10 days, by Theodore Bryant. It covers all the various messages we send ourselves that result in self-defeating behaviour and attitudes.<br>You can recognise the different reasons you procrastinate, they are simply different messages that one part of you is sending the other, informing you that you can't /won't / shouldn't have to / do whatever it is you're procrastinating about. Once you are consciously aware of that then you can "re-programme" your subconscious by sending it conflicting messages. <br><br>It also really helps to write down the negative thought as it flits through your mind, seeing it down on paper makes you realise that it's just a thought, not even real. Then you write a truer and more positive version, it all helps to change your attitude and then in time your behaviour changes too.<br><br>here are some examples from my notebook:<br><br>oh no I'm never going to get all this lesson done<br><br>changed to - <br><br>It can be done over two days, you can make a start now and see how you do. Just ten minutes is all.<br><br>this trip to the dentist is going to be painful.<br><br>changed to - <br><br>the dentist is skilled and will give you enough anesthetic so you don't feel much. You'll be uncomfortable but nothing else.<br><br>( as it turned out I didn't need treatment so I was getting myself in a panic for nothing!)<br><br>What you shouldn´t do is feel bad or berate yourself for any procrastinating. You wouldn't be so hard on a good friend/member of your family if they came to you with the same problem.<br><br>I hope that helps you, oh and congratulations on being a new Dad :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 May 2010 at 17:48 | clara</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Loved the rant Daniel, alot of common ground there, so unfortunately can't offer any assistance.  <br><br>However trying to follow any of the AF methodologies and probably DWM does force you to at least face these procrasination drivers so you can see what the problem is. Then if you follow the method to the letter eventually you do have to tackle a topic or dismiss it. Although it is just easier to accept the procrastination demand and ignore the time management method but clearly that does not help.
