Anxiety (read: suffering) is one of the few universal experiences that bind us all. Some employ quick fix solutions hoping to reduce symptoms and keep doing the same ol, same ol. Other ride the anxiety wave towards self-exploration and growth. As a therapist, I've yet to meet an individual, couple or family who experience meaningless anxiety. As such, I'm not a huge fan of (long-term) medication and/or CBT therapies. <br><br>Beyond finding a good therapist, one of the best books (both theoretically and practically)  I've read is: <br><br>Finding Serenity in the Age of Anxiety:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/Finding-Serenity-Anxiety-Robert-Gerzon/dp/055337978X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260455846&amp;sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.com/Finding-Serenity-Anxiety-Robert-Gerzon/dp/055337978X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260455846&amp;sr=8-1</a><br><br>Good luck!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 December 2009 at 14:43 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi, I've found Neil Fiore to be an invaluable resource.

I can only take him at his word that he has given it some thought, found no reason for his anxiety, and thus labels it "generalized".  Of course there are reasons for everything, but with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the anxiety is rooted in something other than what it is temporaly associated with.  IOW, if you are anxious about a plane ride when one is coming up, and are not anxious at other times, then there is a logical connection and I would not call it generalized.  If you are anxious all the time, and one of those times is when you are on a plane, I would not think the plane ride has anything at all to do with it.<br><br>As to the question of his being right or wrong in how he diagnoses himself ... who knows?

It is being in a state of anxiety (from a low level to near panic) almost EVERY waking hour ... and no matter what you do or how you do it ... it makes not the slightest difference.  You can't take a vacation and get away from it.  Working harder does not help.  Working a new system does not.  It is just ALWAYS there.  It feels as if the universe itself is a threat to your life and/or well-being in some undefined way.  You can't say what you are afraid of.  You can't think why you feel anxious.  You just DO.<br><br>This really is vastly different from feeling as if you are missing a deadline or forgetting an appointment.  Those can be identified and dealt with.  Imagine that you are feeling anxious over a project and someone gave you a large sum of money so you could either hire someone to do everything for you or you could retire to the Bahamas.  You'd feel much better ... yes?  With GAD it would make no difference at all.  Lying there in the sun on the beach would leave you feeling just as anxious.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2009 at 2:18 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A huge factor in GAD that hasn't even been mentioned is the physiological. Individuals with GAD suffer from extensive, debilitating physical symptoms. Yes, those physical symptoms may be a response to mental angst, but the opposite path is just as likely. <br><br>I had a CT-scan as a teen and during it found that I was itching and unable to breathe. Being a psych student even then and knowing the contraption's rep for causing anxiety, I determined to relax and breathe as deeply as possible. This despite the fact that I didn't "feel" anxious. I discovered when it was over that I was experiencing an anaphylactoid reaction. My BP had bottomed out, my face was swollen beyond recognition, and my body was covered with giant hives. I was in the hospital for a week recovering. It was a case of misattribution for sure. :-)<br><br>GAD patients were my specialty in grad school. Physical symptoms must be managed before any psychological work can be effective imo. That can be done with meds or preferably with lots of exercise and to a lesser extent relaxation training. That being said, spiritual growth has been the most effective means of managing anxiety for me personally and professionally.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2009 at 4:06 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"lesser extent relaxation training."<br><br>Mel - I agree with your placement of the above. MSBR literature promises all sorts of things, but (in my professional and personal experience) delivers little of it. Still, I try and meditate on a regular basis. I've learned to appreciate meditation for the moment I'm meditating vs what may happen later. To date, I'm still a little neurotic a la Woody Allen. And last I checked, almost all of my MSBR classmates have either:<br><br>* stopped meditating <br>* continue to do so but have not experienced significant reductions in anxiety</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2009 at 4:54 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"lots of exercise"<br><br>One of the few things that seems to work for sleep, anxiety, depression on and on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2009 at 4:57 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks to all for helpful suggestions.<br><br>It seems that anxiety is little bit different for all of us.
