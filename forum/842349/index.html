I have a bag that's been damaged by airport baggage handling machinery.  I've had to glue it back together.<br><br>It's taken me 35 minutes.  Over the 18 months since the bag was damaged, I have probably devoted 350 minutes to thinking about repairing it, wondering why I don't repair it, scheduling days when I'm going to repair it, concocting good reasons not to repair it, and looking for ways to avoid trying to repair it, most obviously by buying a new one . (But luggage that's any good is surprisingly expensive, and I don't like any of the examplesI see in the shops.)<br><br>I can understand that one might resist embarking on a project that might prove time consuming or awkward or painful. But this was none of those.  Spending more time resisting something than it would have taken to complete is clearly maladaptive.

It will get done for reasons other than pleasant process or avoiding a punishing consequence................unless a punishing consequence draws closer, it's less onerous than other options or you decided to do based on other criteria.<br><br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 July 2009 at 23:18 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>silted down:  There's little or no immediate pleasure/reward and no immediate negative consequence.

I've been moving them around various ToDo-, Someday/Maybe- and other lists, keeping them every time I changed systems. When I switched to AutoFocus a few weeks ago I put them on the list to see what would happen.<br><br>Took me all of 10 minutes to complete them. Go figure.<br><br>The good thing is, of course, that AF2 apparently helps getting things done. A lot.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 July 2009 at 11:25 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Nicole<br>The answer is simple.  The negative traits you attributed to this task or the fact that you always had more pleasant options available, caused you to never choose it because there were no internal or external influences to enforce it.  The other options available always trumped choosing this one.  See, the negative attributions created a resistance barrer to ever choose this over other "options available" without any other governing principles or rules in place to force the choice.  AF2 simply provided you with a governing rule to break the resistance barrier.<br><br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 July 2009 at 12:50 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Small ills are the fountains of most of our groans. <br>Men trip not on mountains, they stumble on stones. <br>-Chinese Proverb<br><br>Learning as I go is right - we need methods to deal with these things that work, and this is where AF really shines over any other system.<br><br>Thomas Leonard wrote alot about the concept of tolerations and unfinished business in his books and programs "The Portable Coach" and "The 28 Laws of Attraction" - his advice was to go through your house / situation and list 100 things that you were putting up with and make a plan to eliminate them.

I failed miserably with it.<br>I'm not advocating that the use of AF is supreme to all other systems.
