I will close out my first backlog by the end of the day, I think.  However, I am feeling some "disconnect" with this approach and I'm not sure where the problem lies.<br><br>I like working from the lists...I think that comes from the "I don't like being told what to do" so I can pick out what I want to do and make great strides in accomplishing it. I also like the flexibility for creative freedom...I'm an artist so if I get in the groove to draw something, I can just go with it for several hours if I feel like it.  <br><br>This lends itself to some time management issues because I can feasibly get drawn into a creative mode and go several hours without ever looking at my list, which causes me to miss important stuff that should have (could have) been completed that day.  <br><br>I went back and skimmed through DIT, especially chapter #6 about scheduling work.  I get the whole concept of timeblocking, but I just don't like it...I think that rolls back around to "I don't like to be told what to do" even if it's being dictated by me!<br><br>Then of course, there is the issue with client work and billable time which probably needs to be scheduled - or does it?  I am alternating days where I schedule and days where I go purely of AF.  They are both productive, but each has it's advantages.  I do like the timeboxing effect of seeing how far out I have scheduled work to be done for clients (so as not to overbook myself) and I do like scheduling a half day here or there for art....but when that time rolls around, I'm often not in the mood to draw.  How does one go with the flow of the list and yet be disciplined enough to not overbook billable work or other activities that are time-consuming?<br><br>Should I just force myself to stick to the time blocks or is there another way I am not thinking about?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 15:22 | Gretchen Cawthon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>How about just a "Hot List"?  Things that are priorities that you must do no matter what.  Put it on a post it and stick it where you work so you'll see it if you get absorbed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 15:29 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am an artist, too (novelist), and I know this "getting lost in the creative mood" very well. My all-purpose-weapon for this is a timer clock. Not in the computer, but a real one. Before I "let loose", I check for dates I shouldn't miss (lunch counts as date, for example :-D), set the clock - only then I can allow myself to let go. It has become a habit.<br><br>The other thing is that sometimes I block times. "9:30 to 11:30 write chapter 23 ff", for example. Either I stick with that plan, or if not (for example, because I'm too distracted), I pull out the AF book and work from there. I know both modes - writing in blocked time or writing as part of working from my AF list. The latter is very much like Mark's "Email" task, recurring again and again: I write some sentences, stop when the juices stop, do something else until the  task "write chapter 23" stands out again, and so on.<br><br>So, both modes are possible, have their pros and cons, and it depends on my mood which one I choose.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 15:38 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As a musician, I find all of these systems fall short in one way or another. If I had one role i.e. songwriter, I probably wouldn't use Autofocus or any structured system. But given that I wear multiple hats, AF helps me keep on top of my various projects. <br><br>For creative work, I enter a task or project with a brief crumb-trail to remind myself what I was working on i.e. finish up drum-loop in project z.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 21:45 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Like AndreasE, I use both time blocks and physical timers for my studio/creative work. I don't resent the time block or the physical timer, because I know that there is nothing else I "have to" or "should" do then, and there is a lot of (unconscious) stress relief in that.<br><br>I have so many studio tasks--some are demanding and some are absolutely simple-minded--so there's no problem with "not wanting" to work. I can always do the non-demanding tasks. The bigger issue is getting lost in my work, and so sometimes I use the timer to remind me to stop. (Mark Forster has commented about this.)<br><br>Like Avrum, I also use bread crumbs and I'll leave a note to myself in my studio where I left off/what I want to finish or do next AND/OR if it's something that has to be completed  before other aspects of the project can proceed I'll put it on my AF list.<br><br>My calendar keeps me honest about the hard deadlines, and my AF list helps me focus on the "spinach" I have to eat in order to have the dessert of unfettered studio time. I motivate myself to do administrative work or household tasks by telling myself that this work is furthering my creative work and is a necessary part of it. And that's true . . . .<br><br>Really, for me, being able to switch back and forth from the "flow" of creative work to the practical, "boring" adminstrative tasks just comes from a lot of experience, including painful experience--periods when I stopped myself from working creatively. Now I know I can switch back and forth--it's like falling into a deep pool!--and so I don't mind stopping OR starting and so I am sometimes slowly but always persistently productive. But that comes, again, just from a lot of practice.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 23:03 | Liz I.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum wrote:<br><br>'For creative work, I enter a task or project with a brief crumb-trail to remind myself what I was working on i.e. finish up drum-loop in project z'<br><br>Bit like GTD next actions? ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 10:21 | smileypete</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
