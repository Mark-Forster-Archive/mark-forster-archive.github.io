It's more of a plea for keeping a meta-list of important projects and focusing on finishing them. I think a lot of us do something similar, whether it's via goals&amp;dreams self-dialogue, weekly reviews, or (my current favorite) making a side list of the Big Three tasks to do each day.  In the latter case, my Big3 usually contain at least one task that moves an important project toward completion.<br><br>The interesting ideas here are the holding pen for entering new projects (not to be worked until the current list is complete), and the 1-week-minimum break as reward for finishing the 6-12 projects on the list.  I'm not sure how realistic these ideas are.  Priorities change. Sometimes what seemed like a brilliant plan one day appears stupid or a waste of time after some reflection. The author didn't address midstream modifications to the list, or exceptions to his rules.<br><br>When I was trying hard to follow the GTD paradigm, I attempted to organize many tasks ("next actions" [NAs]) within projects.  Each project had to have at least one NA defined.  I used active verb phrases to list NAs, and projects were all defined as noun phrases with passive verbs if necessary, so that the name of the project directly stated its finishing criterion.  For example, "Article X submitted" was a project, with "Write draft 1st paragraph of Article X" as an NA.  Focusing this way on very specific verb-oriented tasks and concrete noun-oriented criteria for project completion is helpful, but the rigor of the process can be somewhat joyless.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 August 2011 at 21:49 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ubi:<br><br>&lt;&lt;...can be somewhat joyless. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Pretty much how I feel scanning a list in AF, DWM, etc. Let's be honest, scanning a list with "clean toilet", "call dentist", and discerning what "standing out" means i.e. guilt? excitement? fear?, can cause cognitive exhaustion. <br><br>Perhaps this is a problem with all list-making systems.

Every morning I write in the current C2 list “PROJECTS HOME”. Before I can leave the page I have to work on least one of the projects, ideally on more.

SF3 may be theoretically more efficient, but it is not so psychologically effective.<br><br>Avrum's "guilt, excitement or fear" doesn't describe the process of standing out at all.

They are crippled by avoidance behavior, perfectionism, over-analysis (or its opposite, running down a rabbit-trail prematurely) ... they are all emotion and no planning.

This whole thread reminds me of the dark period when I worked for a large IT services provider (now swallowed up by HP).  Their preferred employee profile was 'Ultra-successful 20-somethings who have no kids do not realize that they have no life', and it was a hellish environment if you were unlucky enough to have been subject to an outsourcing event, say, and didn't fit that profile.  No flexibility was afforded, and this kind of completion focus, taken to an extreme, was the expected behaviour - the unofficial motto was 'we will pay you for 39 hours a week, but if you are not working at least 50-55 hours a week regularly plus more to meet deadlines then you are not working hard enough'. <br><br>As you say, life demands more flexibility than that - in the medium to long term, taking this approach to extremes is an excellent way to cause burnout in many people, or at the very least cause major relationship problems and a burning sense of resentment.  As a way of keeping things on track, the projects list - which is also used in GTD, but with more of a collection focus rather than driving completion - looks like a good addition to the arsenal, but there has to be balance.  Most people work to live - being in, or creating for yourself an environment where you are expected to live to work, can be a hellish experience.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2011 at 11:54 | Paul Taylor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cannot one have both completion-focus and a healthy balance?  Quoting the author:<br>"List 6 – 12 of the most important projects in your life. Pull from all three relevant spheres: professional (e.g., school or work related); personal (e.g., home, family, fitness); and extra (e.g., big projects like blogging, writing a book, starting a club)."<br><br>So he's not saying to neglect anything. He's saying in each sphere consider the most useful allocation of time.  It matches what happens with vision-centered thinking, where big items don't get drowned by the small.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2011 at 12:24 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Alan Baljeu - I think that's what I meant.  If one wants to use this technique then it is essential to ensure that balance is included from all aspects of life, and flexibility included.  It goes wrong when there isn't balance, such as when either the individual places too much focus in one area or is pressed to work in that way by an employer.  It's just that in my experience (and by the sound of it in Bernie's) this approach can easily go off-kilter and result in a 'no life' scenario.  If the pressure is internal I'm not sure what might restore the balance; if the pressure is external then the individual may need to be very firm in pushing back to restore the balance.  If this doesn't work then a major life change like a change of job may be the only solution, as it was in my case.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2011 at 13:04 | Paul Taylor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To be clear, what moved me about this post is how different it feels from AF, particularly when I watch demos of how people use the system. None of my proudest creative accomplishments would have been possible if I lived an Orthodox list-based system. <br><br>Of course, Orthodoxy with project-focus, or list-focus might be more of the problem than the system itself.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2011 at 14:30 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great topic, about the link between process and outcomes. Dreams has helped me here.<br><br>An example: A few months ago I had a lot of niggly health tasks, mostly doctor's appointments, that I had let slide because they just seem to chew up a lot of time. But my life vision includes energy and health, so I found myself pulled to make these appointments and to include them on my "what's better" list and to do the associated online research on the health issues. As a result of these annoying appointments and the "time wasted" in doctor's offices, I've come up with some health changes that mean I have MORE energy than I have had in over a decade! I wake up in the mornings raring to go. And that's EXACTLY what my future vision stated.<br><br>Boring tasks, time consuming, lots of resistance... but when connected with the Dreams process, my vision, the what's better list.... Dream achieved!!<br><br>Now, instead of going to these appointments, I kept feeling tempted to push myself to work on my scholarship. That's more results-oriented. But in the end, it was exactly the right thing to do, because now I have the energy and motivation for my scholarship.<br><br>However, without Dreams, I also had the sense of facing a never ending checklist of tasks. And it did exhaust me. I think Dreams maintains the link between the little tasks and my ultimate vision for my life, so I can see how they contribute to my progress every day.<br><br>Having said all that, I'm still thinking that I want to keep the notion of 'completion' in my mind, too. I'm going to use <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://idonethis.com/">http://idonethis.com/</a> just to stay aware, without pushing, of the end results I'm creating each day. It's different from my "what's better" list in that this focuses more on concrete achievements, milestones, and completions. More work -oriented.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2011 at 15:05 | silviastraka</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sylvia:<br>Thanks for the mention of idonethis.
