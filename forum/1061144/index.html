W and M.  IOW, one month from today for entry of new tasks and one week from today for re-entered tasks.  All other pages are "closed".  Note that the M page is open, then closed, then open again once it reaches 7 days from today, then closed again.  &lt;Whew&gt;<br><br>Numbering:  Mark says re-enter tasks a week hence.  So today is Saturday and a week hence is ... wait for it ... Saturday ;-)  That means that if today is day 1, then a week hence is day 8.  If that bothers you (there being 7 days in a week and all) call today 0 and W day 7.  It's all the same.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  (3) Day 28 (= "M" in my incarnation) is the last active page into which brand new tasks are entered.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>No, it is the ONLY page into which band new tasks can be entered.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Questions:<br>(a) Is today's Day 7 the right place to re-enter tasks, or should it be Day 8, tomorrow's Day 7?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Careful about 7 and 8 there.  It should be one WEEK ahead.  So if today is Saturday you re-enter on NEXT SATURDAY.  (I'm pretty sure I have that right.  It would be too hard to think of the re-entry point for Saturday being next Friday.  That would confuse me beyond belief.  ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  (b) If a task between Day 8 and Day 28 is started but not completed, MUST it be re-entered on Day 7 ONLY  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>YES!  The ONLY place to enter tasks is on one week hence.<br><br>Think of DWM as meaning:<br><br>Your pages are by DAY<br>You re-enter tasks one WEEK hence<br>You enter new tasks one MONTH hence<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  If no, then Day 7 can only contain unstarted tasks (when it was Day 28 three weeks ago) and re-entered tasks from Days 1 - 6, not so?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, that would be the consequence of doing it the wrong way.  The W page contains TWO types of tasks:<br><br>1) Unstarted tasks from when it was the M page<br>2) Started tasks from when it became the W page<br><br>But those started tasks can come from any page, of course.  If there is a task on day 2 or 6 or 12 or whatever which you work on and don't complete, it goes onto the W page.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I raise this because if I make a start on any task between Day 8 and 28 AND the task does not have an impending deadline looming, I don't see why it cannot be re-entered on any day higher than Day 7.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Just because of the rules of DWM.  Of course, you can tweak it any way you like.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  One reason I've noted this is in starting virtually from scratch again in paper mode, I have been spreading various tasks from my ListPro digital over the days to get a sense of balance. As Mike, Alan or other person pointed out, it would be foolhardy to dump the entire inventory of backlog tasks into the Day 28 bucket; the advice given to a newbie was to drop in 5 - 10% of the backlog each day.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yeah, or you could "dump" your tasks onto days 20 -&gt; N so that they are distributed and naturally come up.  Or not "dump" at all but pick the first N tasks from your listpro and put them on day 28 and wait until tomorrow and put them on day 28 again.  But since this is a one time thing, do it the simplest way possible.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  But as I have been creating my new paper incarnation, I have been spreading old ListPro tasks over various days between 1 and 27.

In the last elections we had John McCain running for the Republican Party and for reasons surpassing understanding he selected Sara Palin as his running mate.  He started calling himself a "maverick" and that was bad enough (meaningless labels designed to make fools think an idiot is saying something).  But then Palin took it up and just babbled on and on and on.  It became an embarrassing national joke -- the candidate who knew nothing!  Then she started talking about "going rogue", whatever the hell THAT means.  She is beyond moronic.  You'd have to be here to get the full effect of it.  Let me see if I can get you a pointer or two:<br><br>Here is a fascinating one:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.videonewslive.com/view/260507/sara_palin_cbs_interview_her_worst_interview_yet">http://www.videonewslive.com/view/260507/sara_palin_cbs_interview_her_worst_interview_yet</a><br><br>It starts with a SNL (Saturday Night Live comedy show) spoof interview and just when you've decided that it is funny but too over the top, they show the REAL interview with the REAL Sara Palin that they were spoofing and all you can do is shake your head.<br><br>So the word was fine until this bozo crawled out of the woodwork.
