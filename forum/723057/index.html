I heard Richard Branson speak at a local business lunch some years ago and he really is incredibly motivated.  He came across as very down to earth and a genuinely nice guy; took business very seriously but not himself and had a great way with people.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2009 at 9:12 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Did you see his TV series a few years ago ... his answer to Trump's "The Apprentice"?  It was a hoot.  He kind of mocked DT in the first show and Trump got really grouchy and nasty about it in his comments.  It really did show the difference between the two individuals.  RB had a good time with it and when he gave his contestants a challenge, he did it himself ... including rappelling off  a gorge and having tea on the top of a hot air balloon.  Trump sits back and acts like royalty.  Really great.<br><br>IIRC, his runner up used her money (and other help from RB) to get her product "Spanx" on the market.  He told a story about how he does things.  A flight attendant on his Virgin Airline came up to him on a flight with a business proposal.  He listened, decided that she had thought it out well and it had merit and so he funded it and started her off in business ... at a profit for himself, of course.  But it is great that he is obviously so approachable.<br><br>He is quick to point out that success is not money ... unless that is how you choose to measure it.  I like the guy a lot.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2009 at 9:39 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>No I didn't see that program - not sure it was ever screened here?  They only screened one series of the US apprentice but the original here, with Alan Sugar, has just started it's latest series.  I love that program!  I can never quite believe some of the ridiculous things they do though - like not thinking to shut the doors on cars they were washing with a pressure hose.... !!!!<br><br>I've always had a lot of admiration for RB's approach.  His motivation in setting up the VA airline, was the poor service he felt he had received as a passenger when flying - his motivation was to make his passengers feel valued and respected.  I flew on one of his early flights when the plane was delayed through fog.  We all received a letter advising of the problem, were kept regularly updated, and were given the option of providing details of someone we would like contacted.  The friend who was meeting me was therefore telephoned, two or three times, and kept informed of the status of the flight.  We were diverted into another airport and, rather than just arranging transport to the scheduled airport, (London Gatwick) were offered the option of transport to London Heathrow and Central London as well.  Now THAT was customer service!  I have to say that they don't go to those lengths now but they still win hands down over many of their competitors.  Such an ethos has to come from the top. <br><br>I saw an interview with him a couple of weeks ago and success genuinely doesn't seem to have changed him.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2009 at 13:05 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
