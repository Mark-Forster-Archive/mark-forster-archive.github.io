I forbid twitter.com the execution of Javascript, which is needed to dynamically load the updates. The problem is, if you disable Javascript completely, posting in the forum doesn't work. The solution: Firefox with the "NoScript" extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/722<br><br>Just forbid twitter.com and allow markforster.net - et voil√†, fully functional forum without unnecessary waiting.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2009 at 20:58 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Andreas,<br><br>I checked my No Scripts and have Mark "trusted" and Twitter as "untrusted".

It doesn't seem consistent though - sometimes the pages load almost instantly and at others you can make half a dozen cups of coffee.

I also think it depends on where you are. A speed test I started from an US server claimed that your amazon.co.uk inclusion was a lot worse than twitter.com/grader.com concerning load time. But for me here in Germany (probably Europe in general), amazon.co.uk is lightning fast, but the other two cause noticable delays.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2009 at 0:03 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas:<br><br>It's an interesting problem. I'll give it a few days and see what happens. It seems to have only been bothering people quite recently. One of the people who has reported having a problem doesn't live very far from me - but I know that websites sometimes go slow for all sorts of strange reasons.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2009 at 0:45 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark<br><br>Although the problem has been worse recently it did exist prior to twitter, although the page does state that twitter is still downloading on occasions.  I wondered whether perhaps it coincided with Squarespace carrying out server maintenance?  From memory I would say it is usually late evening (UK time).  This evening it was really dire around 10:00pm but had cleared by around 11:00.<br><br>And welcome back - you've been missed!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2009 at 1:01 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I haven't had any problems on Google Chrome.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2009 at 7:21 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>Good to see you back.  I can report that your site was working well until a few days ago and then it was not just bad, it was a torment.  I mean, 5 seconds plus to load a page.  (Egad, what have we become that a 5 second wait is torment ;-)<br><br>Once I implemented Andras suggestions it is lightning fast.  And I was able to notice that the culprit was Twitter and Grader.Twitter because loading was so slow that I could easily read the progress bar in FireFox.<br><br>The comments by Andreas and Christine make good sense as well.  I know that my ISP dynamically assigns addresses so perhaps my routing changes from time to time.  It could easily be a convergence of factors.  But I can say that with Twitter now in my hosts file my browsing in other places has improved as well.<br><br>(Ah, I remember that I told Andreas that I wanted to go browsing for some recommendations on a populated hosts file so I would not have to keep updating it myself.  One more thing for my AF list ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2009 at 10:29 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would contemplate changing/disabling the sidebars, or at least a large portion of it on the forum pages alone. Not sure if it can be done with the software package that is being used. Having dynamic sidebars that adjust to the type of page you're on (blog/forum/article/frontpage) is better design. That way you can display just the information that is relevant to the page of the website. <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2009 at 10:36 | Peter K</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another thing that would help would be to change the order of the columns in the source code. We discussed this already in the thread where reported the ie6 bug (which is still there by the way, Mark, do you need help with this?). The sidebars are loaded first, then the middle content column. This worses the situation if a sidebar ist sloggy. It would be better if the content showed up first. That would also solve the problem of people who come here with older PDAs (like Laurence in that thread: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/674069">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/674069</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2009 at 11:06 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Some of that last may account for what I'm seeing when I go TO a thread.  If I'm too fast hitting the END key (to get to the bottom) I see nothing on the screen but the sidebar.  If I go back up I'll see a partially loaded center column which then loads a couple of seconds later.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2009 at 11:33 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If you're using Firefox with the Adblock extension, another option is to add <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/javascripts/blogger.js">http://twitter.com/javascripts/blogger.js</a> as a filter.<br><br>It still lets you access the AutoFocusTM link to twitter.com and the AutoFocus page seems to work OK.<br><br>Personally I find the Twitter stuff on the left intrusive, so wonder why I didn't block it before... :)<br><br>I think just a link to Twitter on the left would be fine.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 April 2009 at 16:22 | smileypete</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
