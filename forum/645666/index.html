I've added a new task to Notebook 2:  "review Notebook 1".<br><br>It is already helping me to move faster and stay more focused.

This seems to be OK for now, though I realize I am losing some of the AF benefits by doing this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2009 at 21:49 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I will be reaching the end of my first (home) notebook soon.

In fact re-entering may not be such a daunting task - it will be less than 10 pages and writing out a page may only take 5 minutes or so.  My suggestion would be to rewrite the tasks but you do not need to do that in one go. When you are ready to start the new book work out how many pages you need for the old items (remember to include space for a line between each "page" as per Mark's recommendation), and add a task to "add old items to new notebook".  You can then add the tasks gradually, knowing you have enough space, and start you new lists say 8 or so pages in.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2009 at 17:56 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm on my second notebook for personal items. I did the recopy thing, and I have to say that was the first part of the system I hated. It took so long that I ended up spreading it over three days, and I definitely felt slowed down, and like you Seraphim I was definitely resisting it. I've been looking into the disc notebook option (Circa/Atoma/Rollabind/Mindology) and like what I perceive to be the benefits of this:<br>- I can always add more pages without recopying.<br>- I can also deal easily with projects, by having section for projects to which I can easily add more pages as necessary.<br>- I've been using a second notebook for meeting notes, and then copying tasks to my AF list. I like the idea of just being able to move things from a notes section to a project section all within one notebook.<br>- I've also been thinking that pages that are complete on both sides could just be pulled out of the notebook, leaving more room for new pages and making it easier to work through the earlier part of the list.<br><br>Mark - do you think there is any problem from what I'll call your psychological design of the system to remove pages that have all tasks complete? I'll miss seeing all those completed tasks, but there are certainly plenty of them on the not yet complete pages. Any one else doing this? How is it working for you?<br><br>Also, at a more practical level, I've always hated writing on the left side of a notebook as I bump my hand into the spiral binding (right-handed, obviously). Have disc notebook users found it to be just as bad on these types of notebooks?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Sam</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2009 at 18:10 | Sam G</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sam,<br><br>With some (most?) wire bound spiral notebooks it's possible to open it at the end of the book, prise the wire binding apart a little, take the covers out, and replace/add some pages at the front, then press the binding together.<br><br>Shouldn't be more than a 5 - 10 minute job.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2009 at 18:54 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>All the more reason to use a Circa or Rollabind notebook, which doesn't end. You can just add new pages as needed, and take old ones out to save space. See Levenger.com.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2009 at 20:51 | Jennifer George</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine, thanks for writing it out like that.  I'm leaning towards option 2.  It makes it seem more feasible to think about doing it over a couple days.  For me, having a spiral bound "fixed" book is best.  If I could move pages in or out, it would freeze me in indecision.  One of the great things autofocus has done for me is limit my options - Consider the items on just this one page, etc!<br><br>This may seem crazy to some people, and others will understand perfectly.  I'm worried that psychologically I'll have a problem with following Mark's guidelines to still consider the multiple groups on a new page (divided by horizontal lines) as separate pages.  I know when I can physically 'see' the other items it will be very hard not to become distracted.<br><br>For practical purposes, I may just go with the flow of the new physical pages.  The oldest items will still be altogether at the beginning, and it will work itself out over time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2009 at 23:53 | Lynn (Florida, US)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Lynn<br><br>Your concern about the treating the pages as separate pages when you can see the other items does make perfect sense.  Not having got to that stage myself I cannot say how I would find it - it may be that you just have to be really disciplined about it and it may turn out not to be a problem at all!  However as Mark says, the page structure is really important.  The danger of just adding the items on complete pages is that you will have pages of high resistance items and under the rules of AF could end up having to dismiss most of them. <br><br>I guess another option could be to photocopy the remaining pages and tuck them at the front of the book until cleared but that is not then a "fixed" book.<br><br>I would suggest adding them with the dividing lines as per Mark's recommendation and see what happens ...... it may just work perfectly well .........:-)<br>Good luck!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2009 at 0:41 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think a neat idea would be to:<br><br>- write your 3 or 4 or 10 items at the bottom of the page<br><br>- pull some of Mark's and other's valuable advice/posts into Word, print to fit your page, and glue or tape them onto those front pages where there's the blank lines up at the top of the page<br><br>Why not work on the current book for awhile dismissing and finishing so there isn't 250 items to transfer over?  Isn't that a sign that you've taken too much on?  <br><br>When you move to a new house, don't you declutter first before you move rather than moving all the old junk in?  (Note - That's not what I did the last 3 moves - which is why I have the clutter that I have to clear out now.)  When I move into my RV next year, I'm not going to take all the stuff in my current house into it, I'll take the necessities and the (very few) things I love and leave the rest in the someday/maybe storage locker.  Moving is a great opportunity to review all of the stuff you've accumulated (using the beautiful or useful rule), and so would moving to a new book (using a love it or really need to do it rule).  <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2009 at 2:02 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I transferred tasks from an electronic system to a paper system.  To begin with, I just entered all the tasks, and used the page structure "as is".  But what it meant was I had one or two pages of very difficult/resist-worthy tasks.  When I saw this thread orginally, I put lines between the pages and my ability to work through those pages improved incredibly.<br><br>May I suggest a solution to the initial 250 task problem?  I would suggest moving pages over that have only a few active tasks, and using the books in tandem until you work down those pages that have more.  I find that I can work down some of my older pages quite quickly on some days, so this would be a compromise between carrying over everything, and carrying two notebooks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2009 at 5:11 | DrCris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Or simply rip out the active pages, staple them to the front cover and treat them as the first pages of the new book.  This works if you don't want to archive your todo do list, otherwise perhaps the photocopy idea would be good.  IMO, anything to avoid having to carry two books around would be a plus.<br><br>One more thought .. don't underestimate the value of copying.  I find that when I recopy (usually to tidy up a bit) I am really doing a review.  At that time, I clarify the tasks, reword, dismiss some that don't really want to be done add others that occur to me, etc.  Good times ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2009 at 10:25 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good point about the value of copying Mike!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2009 at 11:14 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wow, we're all really different.  Although I started AF near the beginning and have been using it very consistently at work, I've only just started page 13 of my at-work notebook (40 lines per page).  And that includes a lot of repeat items, where I work on something, cross it out, then enter it at the end.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2009 at 16:44 | Balfour</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Although I haven't yet finished a notebook, I have closed some pages where there were only one or two items yet that needed to be done, not dismissed.<br>Every so often I put 'Consolidate Autofocus' as a task and transfer all those odd one or two tasks onto my current page, putting a forward arrow rather than a tick on the original page and then crossing the page off and closing all that page. This is helping me to 'keep current', to see what is sticking, being resisted, and sometimes to work out why, too.<br>And more things are getting done than I ever thought possible and not hanging around in my head or in my worries for ages!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2009 at 17:01 | Giulia B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Giulia,<br><br>If you do it that way, you'll lose some of the power of AF.  In order for it to work, you have to dismiss items that remain when the others on the page are done.  If you simply move them forward, they are not dismissed and can hang around for another whole cycle of pages.  If you want to consolidate, keep the page structure.  IOW, put the remaining items from one page as new items on a blank page, draw a line indicating the page boundary, then add items from another consolidated page, draw a line, etc.  Don't put anything else on those consolidated pages.  Then in your cycle of pages, when you come to that consolidated page, treat each "section" as a separate page (because that was what it was before consolidation) and dismiss if you don't do at least one item of that group.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2009 at 18:39 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Giulia, that's what I used to do with my task lists when I used a task diary system - did you find that the old / consolidated tasks were easier to do that way rather than following the guidelines?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2009 at 18:41 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline -<br>yes, I am finding that old/consolidated items are easier that way.<br><br>Mike - <br>I actually totally dismiss very little because I have followed Mark's advice from DIT to prioritise at the beginning, before committing to a task or project, so it is all important.<br>If I enter something which is an idea or suggestion or even a wild dream, I write it as an action, a verb not an adjective - think about/decide/consider, etc - so that gets done even if my final answer is 'no' - it gets ticked off as having been done rather than dismisssed. I sometimes write the reason for my decision next to the item.<br>It works for me, anyway.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2009 at 19:57 | Giulia B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Giulia,<br><br>Yes, I can see that you are using the AF list a bit differently.

However I found it frustrating because I was turning the pages a lot and they started curling and catching around the disks. I am preferring using the A5 hardback notebook I moved to after a couple of weeks, as it feels smoother and more secure. BUT, when I need a new book I think I will have a lot of outstanding tasks to move and will then wish I was using Rollabind still.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2009 at 17:09 | Kate Davis</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
