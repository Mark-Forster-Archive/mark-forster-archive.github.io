What you do in life depends upon what you are and what you want. What you get from life depends upon how much you want it—how much you are willing to work and plan and cooperate and use your resources. The long span of the bridge of your life is supported by countless cables that you are spinning now, and that is why today is such an important day. Make the cables strong! - L.G. Elliott <br><br>I never could have done what I have done without the habits of punctuality, order, and diligence, without the determination to concentrate myself on one subject at a time. - Charles Dickens <br><br>The shorter way to do many things is to do only one thing at a time. - Mozart <br><br>The successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don't like to do. They don't like doing them either necessarily. But their disliking is subordinated to the strength of their purpose. -  E.M. Gray <br><br>It's not the work that's hard, it's the discipline. - Anon<br><br>Perseverance is more prevailing than violence; and many things which cannot be overcome when they are together, yield themselves up when taken little by little. - Plutarch <br><br>Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after another. - Walter Elliott <br><br>All great masters are chiefly distinguished by the power of adding a second, a third, and perhaps a fourth step in a continuous line. Many a man has taken the first step. With every additional step you enhance immensely the value of your first. - Ralph Waldo Emerson <br><br>Success seems to be connected with action. Successful men keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don't quit. - Conrad Hilton <br><br>One of the commonest mistakes and one of the costliest is thinking that success is due to some genius, some magic - something or other which we do not possess. Success is generally due to holding on, and failure to letting go. You decide to learn a language, study music, take a course of reading, train yourself physically. Will it be success or failure? It depends upon how much pluck and perseverance that word "decide" contains. The decision that nothing can overrule, the grip that nothing can detach will bring success. Remember the Chinese proverb, "With time and patience, the mulberry leaf becomes satin." - Maltbie Davenport Babcock <br><br>A "No" uttered from deepest conviction is better and greater than a “Yes” merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoid trouble. - Gandhi <br><br>What you have to do and the way you have to do it is incredibly simple.

It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.

Before I became disabled, I could simply use my sense of decency and responsibility to do what I had to do to keep my conscience reconciled.

Worse, I shame myself with thoughts like....It took you half hour to mop the floor, you bloodied up your food....now you have to throw it all away...don't talk because people think you're mentally handicapped or a drunk.......then....I think.....HELL TO!

Intellectual virtue springs from and grows from teaching, and therefore needs experience and time. Moral virtues come from habit. . . . They are in us neither by nature, nor in despite of nature, but we are furnished by nature with a capacity for receiving them, and we develop them through habit. . . . These virtues we acquire by first exercising them, as in the case of other arts. Whatever we learn to do, we learn by actually doing it: men come to be builders, for instance, by building, and harp players, by playing the harp. In the same way, by doing just acts we come to be just; by doing self-controlled acts, we come to be self-controlled; and by doing brave acts, we become brave. . . .<br><br>Do not wish to be anything but what you are, and to be that perfectly.  ~ Saint Francis de Sales<br><br>It doesn't matter how well you walk the path, if it's not your path. ~ Katherine Benziger<br><br>Life must be measured by thought and action, not by time. ~ Sir John Lubbock</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2010 at 14:28 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That is a very nice collection.

This fish moved about, and caused him a lot of discomfort. When he tried to tell people about the fish, they thought him ‘crazy’, which led to violent arguments. After he’d been hospitalized several times - with no effect on the fish - it was suggested that perhaps he shouldn’t tell anyone. After all it was the quarrels that were getting him put away, rather than the delusion. Once he’d agreed to keep his problem secret, he was able to lead a normal life. We may not have a fish in our jaw, be we all have its equivalent."<br>— Keith Johnstone in Impro</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2010 at 10:14 | Norman U.</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
