But I don't want to work on this 2 tasks. I also don't want to delete them. I will process them sometimes later.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 12:58 | jens</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"don't want to" is cheating. "can't" is acceptable. As a compromise, I would reconsider the items and think about how much need be done to feel Satisfied with your progress, and rewrite the task to say this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 13:13 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think you are breaking the rules if you work on a Column 2 task but don't finish it, and re-enter it into Column 1 on the last page.   But there are other ways of handling the situation that don't break the rules, and keep fully within the spirit of the rules as well.<br><br>Let's say I have a Column 2 task called "Project X".   Maybe since the time I started working on that project, my priorities have changed (new project, new disruption of some kind, etc.) and I just don't have time for Project X right now.<br><br>Following the rules, I still MUST take SOME action on Project X before leaving the page (since it's in Column 2), and I MUST copy it forward to Column 2 of the next page if it's not finished.  However, the rules allow me to re-enter the task however I want, whenever I take action and move the task forward.  <br><br>So, here is how I handle it.  My "action" for "Project X" might be to take a quick look at the Project X files, or something like that.   After this quick action, I might re-enter it in Column 2 of the next page as "Wrap up Project X for now".  <br><br>When I come to THAT task, I wrap it up for now, which is COMPLETED, thus allowing me to escape from Column 2.  Then I can re-enter the task as "Project X" in Column 1 of the last page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 16:35 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think that if you cross it off of column 2 and put it in column 1 you may be succumbing to procrastination. Whereas if you take some action and still want to rewrite it as "wrap up project X for now" in the next column 2, you are at least doing it from a better place mentally. I just experienced this on a task I started from col1, and was kind of hating the task. I really wanted to just put it back in column 1 but after I did it for 15 minutes I decided it was ok in column 2 because at least I made some progress. Maybe it won't be so bad if I do a little bit of this at a time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 16:45 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, I think you are right. It has a little quantum of procratination. I feel guilty :-(<br><br>But generally, if I have several hard nuts to crack on c2 and feel overwhelmed I could imagine to put the task in c1 and let the dismissal rule decide if time is really ripe for this task/project, although I had started it yet (unfinished). Thus, according to Seraphim I could put "send project x to c1" on the next page c2 without breaking the rules, right?<br>Maybe the next time I meet the task/project it would probably find it's way back to c2...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 20:59 | jens</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>jens:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Is it according the rules if I strike through a task in C2 (unfinished) and reenter it on the last page in C1 without working on the task? &gt;&gt;<br><br>No, it's not. Tasks in Column 2 must be worked on and re-entered in Column 2 until they are finished.<br><br>It's your fault for not defining the task more closely when you put it on the list in the first place!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 21:04 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; However, the rules allow me to re-enter the task however I want, whenever I take action and move the task forward. &gt;&gt;<br><br>They do?

E.g. if I started a task the day before yesterday and the task manages to visit some c2 columns, but suddenly the project which owns this task changes to rather pending than active. Then the rules forces me to work on the task inspite of the priority shift or to delete it. Thus, it has no chance to get a "close season" in c1...<br><br>Would it be reasonable to strike through the task/project and move it in somewhat like a pending folder (Someday/Maybe)?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 21:33 | jens</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>jens,<br><br>Pending is another matter. I think when you have done eveything for now that you can, and are now waiting for something, you cross it off and it goes in column 1. Let's say your project is to upgrade your computer. After you research your options and place your order, you're waiting for the shipment to arrive. So now you have a new column 1 action of waiting for computer to arrive.<br><br>If you're talking about a supervisor telling you to drop a project then I guess it is done. No point in working on it anymore. Cross it off because it's done. You could put a column 1 item to ask about the project later. Or just trust that the subject will come up again if it's important.<br><br>If it's just low priority, I think you could still keep working on it little and often. Since you write it on the next page, it shouldn't cause a huge issue. I find it's nice to make progress on low priority tasks this way.<br><br>Remember what it says at the beginning of the SF rules: it balances urgent and non-urgent, and it makes you finish what you start.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 21:51 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; However, the rules allow me to re-enter the task however I want, whenever I take action and move the task forward. &gt;&gt;<br><br>And Mark Forster responded:<br>&lt;&lt; They do?

If the project parameters have changed in the way you indicate, then basically you have done everything that needs doing now. In other words, you have finished the task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2011 at 0:41 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
