Obviously if you set a goal it involves identifying tasks that you need to do to achieve the goal (much like a project really). I'm wondering if there is any benefit to colour coding entries onto the task list - for example using a specific colour to identify tasks which relate to goals? <br><br>I am wondering if this might make them stand out a little and so they jump out to be done. Although I often have client work which gets to be very urgent so fire fighting can be a big part of my day - mostly because of how they work rather than how I work! As their work pays the bills I have to do it.<br><br>I'd be interested in other peoples views on this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 October 2011 at 18:34 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I love simplicity. My task list is a tool; it's not the focus of my efforts. Personally, I wouldn't go through the effort of color-coding my tasks. I'm not saying that it's not worthwhile to make your goal-oriented tasks distinguishable, though. If I were to mark my goal-tasks, I'd probably just put a capital G at the beginning.<br><br>Of course, you can take anything I say with a grain of salt. This is what I would do IF I did it, but I don't mark my goals in any shape, form, or fashion. I do a daily morning "Dreams" session to make sure my mind is inline with my goals with the hopes/expectations that this will drive my intuition towards the appropriate tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 October 2011 at 19:21 | jFenter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison:<br>&lt;&lt;I'm not very good at setting goals and working towards them&gt;&gt;<br><br>If it's the setting of them have you tried "Some things I'd like from living now..." exercise, or is it taking action on them? if the latter maybe your goals don't provide enough pulling power? You may need to be clearer about what the rewards of the goal would be and what those goals would give you that you wouldn't otherwise have. I'd suggest writing a paragraph on why you want that goal would provide enough clarity to create Pull. They might just be goals your ego thinks it ought to be setting, but if your heart isn't in it...Or how about a paradoxical goal? "I aim to live with peaceful acceptance of my life exactly the way it is now for the next 3 years".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 October 2011 at 20:55 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison:<br><br>I think trying to colour code everything that relates to a goal would be just too much overhead. It would be for me anyway!<br><br>What might be a good exercise though is to select a goal that you want to pay particular attention to for a while and colour every task in your list that relates to that goal. Then ask yourself whether these tasks make sense in relation to that goal and whether you need others. <br><br>This would be a snapshot exercise rather than an ongoing commitment, so wouldn't raise the overhead.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 October 2011 at 21:38 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>jFenton: thanks for the input - the G idea is a good one.<br><br>Michael: I think the problem is more that I spend so much time fire fighting that I don't set the goals and then follow through in them. Certain personal events have made me realise that I have stood still in some areas over the last few years where I would have like to see progression. I think your ideas are very useful though - I will bear them in mind as I work through this process. I have a plan for writing down the actual goal and also visualising it by either writing something or possibly even using pictures to give me to right feelings.<br><br>Mark: I wasn't thinking of colour coding everything - just goals with one colour. However I can see what you mean about overhead. Perhaps as you suggest concentrating on one goal would be the way to go as a bit of an experiment.<br><br>I'm planning on making one goal for work and one for personal to start with - I do have a tendency to go over the top with new ideas, so just one in each of these two areas will probably be enough to see some progress.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 October 2011 at 22:58 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison:<br>&lt;&lt;over the top with new ideas&gt;&gt;<br><br>I'd indulge that habit rather than repress it. I believe that if you allow ALL your ideas to flow into an AF1 list then Mark's "standing out" and "dismissal" processes will allow your unconscious over time to help you ummm ....autofocus! You may also feel more liberated and more at ease.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 October 2011 at 9:51 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well said, michael!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 October 2011 at 11:35 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The online app Toodledo has a goal-tracking feature. I've tried Toodledo for AF variations without too much success, but I always did their goal feature.<br><br>Basically, any task can be shown as belonging to a goal. You can optionally sort by goals and see your tasks that way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 October 2011 at 13:40 | DS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison,<br><br>I find the most effective method is to time block.  I use DO IT and set aside specific blocks of time to work on my goals.  For me, I define goals as non day job goals.  If I do not set aside time I find they will not be done.  For me fitness goals are in the morning before work.  Writing and investing goals are lunch hour and music goals are the evening.  These are blocks of mostly uninterrupted time I can focus on them.  During work hours, I use TM.  I found mixing goals and TM activities did not work for me, as the work stuff interrupted the goal stuff.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 October 2011 at 15:52 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Me:&lt;&lt;allow ALL your ideas to flow into an AF1&gt;&gt;<br><br>As an experiment I've started following up on my own advice (!) by being deliberately more grand and big-thinking in my AF1 list, even letting fantasy have a voice. I felt too many small things had taken over and the "Dreams" and "Fantasies" and "Delights" in living had got lost. This has had the effect so far of creating a state of more mental relaxation and a shift in attention to what kind of way of living I want, rather than what I could get done. After all, what's the point of getting more done if my state of being isn't at it's best or my way of living declines? I think it was Jim Rohn (a motivational speaker from the USA) who said you should set goals because of who you'd have to become to attract them. Thanks for the inspiration Alison.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 October 2011 at 18:35 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My pleasure Michael!

Mental confusion and disorder." A "treatment" for which could be the affirmation:" I allow my mind to relax and be at peace.
