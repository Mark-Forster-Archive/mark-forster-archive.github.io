Couple of C2 tasks later, I had ported over quite easily from my Todopaper setup. But then, I dont have too many individual tasks; I tend to have a few hairy projects I battle with most of the day. CV is ideal for those kinds of things-collecting research notes from the web and the like, and hyperlinking is very easy. Hope you have fun with it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2011 at 17:35 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; Looks interesting, and tempting &gt;&gt;<br><br>Roger, it is very interesting especially if you are inclined to Checkvist strengths ...<br>* hierarchical lists - really great for outlining /breaking down tasks into sub-tasks and sub-sub-tasks in projects portion of the list. <br>* unmatched keyboard support - everything can be done using the keyboard<br>* search and filtering - instant filtered tasks as you key in the search keyword<br>... the above are the first three reasons given in Checkvist login screen, and first two are not in Toodledo.<br><br>Main cons, no native client for mobile, and mobile web version is very limited for now.<br><br>I also find Checkvist giving more paper like feel when doing Superfocus ...<br><br>(1) Scanning tasks  - Mark said, "As for my actual scanning technique, I do it with a pen in hand and pause momentarily at each task." The cursor, highlighting current task with blue background, moved using arrow down key, replicates this feel quite nicely. <br><br>(2) Reentering tasks - Manually you would cross out the task in current page, flip to page and rewrite the reentered task whilst getting a feel of what other task are on the last page, then you flip back to current page. In Checkvist you Ctrl-end on task to be rentered it get moved after last page, you press tab-tab (or ctrl-right, ctrl-right) and task move to last slot of last page. Whilst doing that and Paging up to get back to current page you get a feel of tasks on the last page.<br><br>(3) Done tasks - Strike-out all the way through with a pen. In Checkvist a space-bar click strike-out the task and grey it.<br><br>Just giving you more "excuse" to give yourself "a change to fool around with [Checkvist]", as JD did. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 May 2011 at 13:50 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Okay, I am a convert :) Moved my toodledo lists to checkvist. It definitely feels like a paper based workflow. Also, the ability to have the lists numbered helps me to limit the number of items per page - a pain point for me with toodledo. I put a line between the C2 items, Home, Work items - visually much easier than toodledo where I had to mess around with priorities etc. <br><br>I am hoping for a native iPhone app in the near future. But, till then I will get by with mobile view. <br><br>sabre23t, <br>Thanks for all your help. I do have a question. How do you deal with dismissed items?

I found one iRT GTasks Outliner for Android, that syncs with Google Tasks for desktop/notebook. After a quick try yesterday, today is my first full day using the combination of iRT GTasks Outliner for Android mobiles with Google Tasks on the desktop/notebook. I'll report my progress in a separate thread, and see whether after a week or two I can live with its limitation on desktop/notebook, or come back to CV. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 June 2011 at 7:48 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi all - I've turned things inside out again, but I am quite happy with what emerged after tossing the tech-salad bowl.<br><br>I owe it all to Mark of course! After his post on the 'Dreams' set up in Evernote, I decided to give it another look, having earlier chosen OneNote over it because I liked the flexible way it kept information, and the ease of implementing a tech solution for SF.<br><br>I was bowled over by Evernote - its key strength is the multiple ways you can view and relate to your information through a slick tags system. Sure, ON has tags, but it is cumbersome to set and view information in their tagged form. For example, Marks Dreams post which I clipped to EN can be viewed as 'Web clips", or as 'Dreams', two tags I set up. <br><br>The upshot of all of this is that I back to pen and paper on my SF list! That's because EN sucks as a list manager and I don't really want to be working off two programs daily. <br><br>I'm feeling increasingly productive (everything gets deposited into EN efficiently referenced), and good ol' pen and paper keeps me moving quickly through the SF list. I suppose that's what I wanted for my work - a good repository for my projects and papers and less of a tech solution for SF itself. I wonder if my own Dreams statement had anything to do with this!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 June 2011 at 20:45 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi JD,<br>&lt;&lt; everything gets deposited into EN efficiently referenced ... good ol' pen and paper keeps me moving quickly through the SF list &gt;&gt;<br><br>I did consider doing SF on my small carry everywhere A7 notebook. However, I've been using that small notebook as my quick capture everything device. Doing both in the same small A7 notebook is a bit crammed. So i'm still doing SF on an outlining tool (iRT GTasks Outliner) on my Android mobile as mentioned above. I did peek at a nice mind mapping software on Android recently though, Thinking Space. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 June 2011 at 10:56 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wow ... it has been that long ago that I used CheckVist (CV). At the moment, I have fallen off SF and FV bandwagon. Only jotting down must do on a short list and doing them. Just started using CV again.<br><br>Anyway, quite recently there is a touch screen friendly mobile web version of CV at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://m.checkvist.com">http://m.checkvist.com</a> . You can now easily move/promote/demote tasks with by touching/dragging. You should be able to easily use mobile web CV for FV/SF now. Anyone doing that? GC?
