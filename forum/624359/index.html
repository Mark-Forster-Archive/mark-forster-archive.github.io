This is working very well for me.<br><br>(1) I have the list in categories, with start date as the sole category.<br>(2) The list is sorted by date created, so all new entries are always at the bottom of the list.<br>(3) I also sort by priority (there are some things I wish to flag as very high priority) and subject.<br>(4) I collect all new incoming tasks and put them in the start date for today -- that is my first page.  With my volume of work, this works pretty well.<br>(5) The next day, all new tasks go in that day's date, creating my second page, and so on.  <br>(6) If I have worked on a task, but have not completed it, I simply create a new task with the same title and enter it -- it goes at the bottom of the page.  I then check complete the previous entry and I have it setup so that completed tasks are automatically removed.<br>(7) I enter the following at the beginning of a task that has a hard due date:<br>DUE: 1/8  Here is the title of the task<br>I also have a rule setup so that tasks that have DUE: in the subject line are shown in blue color, bold, and underlined.  It is thus very easy to see these tasks that have hard due dates.<br>(8) For dismissing tasks, I have the following setup.  I make them low priority, which results in a large blue, downward arrow showing before the task, and I have a rule setup that low priority tasks are colored light gray.  These then are also very easily spotted.<br><br>This is working extremely well for me and is in aligment with the principles that Mark has described in AF.<br><br>-David<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 20:56 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is really helpful, thanks David.<br><br>It was my first day trying the new system today and I found it quite enjoyable. I decided I'd rather have a full list of tasks broken only by 'pages' of set lengths, rather than lists of varying lengths depending on what I add each day. My workaround for today was to print out the list, which just on the default setting gave me around 30 tasks per page. I'm planning to try a couple of other things, such as archiving and folders of tasks, suggested on a post elsewhere (and might even consider trying the notebook and pen approach at some point)...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 January 2009 at 22:36 | Kirsty McGuinn</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Kirsty<br><br>As a normally extremely digital being I would suggest the pen &amp; notebook approach to start with.  The simpler you keep the system (and as per Mark's instructions) the easier it is to start experiencing the process.  Too much attempt to analyse or rationalise the process really can undermine it.  Give it a try as is for a few days and see how you get on ..........</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 January 2009 at 23:11 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine:<br><br>I have to say that the experience of trying to understand what on earth all the electronic techies on this forum are talking about has made me profoundly thankful that I am doing AF with paper and pen!<br><br>That's not to decry their efforts, which will be very helpful to others who want electronic AF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 12:14 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re: Paper v. Digital,<br><br>I find these to be two very different experiences.  I started with paper because the exercise of copying things down and moving them around has helped me expose my misunderstandings of the system.  I then drew a flow chart because the number of rules was still confusing at times.<br><br>I don't know if I will ever go digital with this or not.  I have tried that in the past and find that digital works well for my planning tasks but I am not on the computer all day as part of my job so the execution part is best handled by paper.  (In my case, a notebook that fits in my pocket.  Which, BTW, dictates the number of items on a page.)<br><br>Experience tells me that implementing this by a digital solution will deepen understanding, but it will also lead to lots of "tweaks".  The temptation to use the "features" of software products is overwhelming and irresistible ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 12:34 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use the computer because it does what I need easier and faster than paper. And when I don't have access to a computer, I'm doing something definite or I am on a schedule - and I still have a PDA.<br><br>What amazes me is that anyone can have something they describe as a functional system using Outlook.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 12:47 | Dm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well said Mike - in my experience too anything digital somehow has an unresistable temptation to be tweaked.  For me my digital solution works "because" it mirrors my paper solution which is my primary AF "system.<br><br>I use an A4 34 lined pad and a pen - easy.<br>On screen my pages look like an A4 34 lined pad - easy.<br><br>The advantages of the digital approach? Neater than my handwriting. (Not really important!)<br><br>I love my digital solution because it suits me but the other "perceived" advantages are mainly just that, perceived.

The folders are called "Screen 01" etc. At the moment I have three such folders. Completed e-mails are deleted or moved elsewhere if warranted. Incomplete mails are moved to the last open screen e.g. Screen 03. When Screen 01 is empty I will rename it "Screen 04" or whatever is next.<br><br>Any categorizing, flagging etc is done in Nelson Email Organizer (Neo), which I can highly recommend.<br><br>The aim is to maintain simplicity. It mirrors AF except that I don't have a record of discarded tasks. This could be addressed if worthwhile to the user.<br><br>So far the system is working well for me although it probably requires more testing before I can vouch for it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2009 at 16:21 | Geoff</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
