First, I am going to maintain my Outlook 2007 setup of all of my time-sensitive tasks associated with my deadline-driven major projects.  All other tasks -- the important ones that I never seem to have time to do -- writing manuscripts, book chapters, etc. are going into a paper notebook for Autofocus.  Yes, you can put your eyes back into your head.  This digital person is going to try a notebook-based system -- EXACTLY as Mark has described.  I then will schedule time in my Outlook calendar  as "Discretionary AF time".  During this block time, I ONLY will do tasks in my AF notebook.<br><br>I fully realize this is still two systems, but with my situation, I have come to the conclusion that I need to do it this way.  The more I have thought about this, the more excited I have become!  <br><br>Wish me luck.  This way, I can maintain my digital, nightmarish, deadline-driven setup in Outlook....but then can escape periodically in scheduled blocks to do AF from a paper notebook.<br><br>Thanks to all who have suggested this approach!<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2009 at 15:18 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi David<br>This sounds quite promising.  I don't really consider it to be two systems.  Your af diary seems to be a subset of your major aims and obligations(that get overshadowed by louder things ). hmmmm.....It's brilliant that you've morphed af into a list of important tasks linked to important obligations and aims rather than a brain dump list....hmmmmm.....you've got me thinking!  Yet again, thank you!

See my post earlier about "From Paper to Electronic to . . . . ?"  I too have decided I'm better off with paper AF PLUS Outlook for the time-bound stuff you describe, including reminders for AF items, but not too many.<br><br>I am currently updating my AF lists (Work at front of Moleskine 127mm x 210mm brown cover ruled notebook, Personal at back of same book "upside down"), but still using Outlook 2007 (with some TWC settings, to be reviewed and revised).<br><br>I like the concept of Discretionary AF Time, may try it a try.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2009 at 15:54 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sorry, last bit of my reply should read "may give it a try."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2009 at 15:55 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks learning as I go and Roger J for your encouragement.

Over the past 18 months, I have read your posts with interested and I was a little sad that you were not posting much any more.  Or perhaps you were posting with your normal frequency, it is just the volume of posting for AF is enormous.  <br>Echoing others if AF does not work for you but DIT does, great.<br><br>Since reading all of Mark's three books I have been attempting his suggestions and although I loved the idea of DIT, I just could not keep it going consistently.  I would keep it going with some sucess for a couple of weeks and then events would overtake me and DIT would drop by the wayside.  I would then restart several months later and repeat the pattern.  <br>Although I am cheating sometimes (or perhaps, just doing something out of order now because it is urgent but more likely because I fancy doing it) and I am probably not entering enough tasks, I have stuck with AF for 8 weeks and that I see as an achievement.  Overall I feel more in control of my work and I am sure that little will fall between the cracks.  The number of outstanding tasks does concern me but I know what they are and I know they will get tackled, as opposed to them disapearing in my diary since I did not do them tomorrow.   <br>Thanks Mark for this new system and thanks to all for the excellent forum.   <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2009 at 13:14 | David W</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi David W,<br><br>Thanks for your encouragement.

It's great fun and quite a confidenct boost to schedule a block of time to AF!  These are important tasks which don't need to be scheduled yet need to get done (according to me!  LOL!)  This is a nice break from the scheduled stuff that doesn't have the same amount of "wiggle room"......<br>I clicked the above hyperlink suggested by Silvia, and saw your post...<br><br>Rick,<br><br>Oh my...you really do need to study something at least a bit before making such a sweeping condemnation of Autofocus. I am a professor at a major research university in the United States and lead a large research team. I have NIH grants and consider myself somewhat successful. I will tell you now that Autofocus is HARDLY just a to-do list! I am using it to manage my very busy and stressful professional life (and personal life too althought that is not so stressful) and find it to be the best time management system I have ever used. <br><br>Why don't you try it out for a while to see why so many world-wide are so positive about it?<br><br>And you are always welcome here....<br><br>-David <br>March 5, 2009 at 19:06 | David Drake <br><br>Am I reading this correctly?  Have you expanded your AF implementation to include more than your Important discretionary tasks such as writing, reading, etc?<br>Inquiring minds want to know!  LOL!<br>I'm all ears if you've discovered a way to integrate even more tasks, actions, etc into your AF list.  I actually regard my AF timeblock as a refreshing reward from my other tasks.  (For my purposes, I don't include things that are time-sensative within a week...but I do find myself wanting to insert some of these tasks into it....but I don't trust my memory that much!  LOL!<br>Thank you so much for your great suggestion.  Again, I actually rather enjoy my AF timeboxed times...It feels more like a carrot than a stick!  LOL!<br>Have you "expanded" your AF list to include anything relating to timebound tasks such as independent tasks related to deadlined projects or independent tasks related to scheduled meetings.....?<br>I guess I'm being a chicken because I've failed at integrating these types of actions......YET.....if you have found a way to broaden the AF list to include some types of these actions.....please write a post.  If not, please write a post anyway!  LOL!  Somehow I relate to what you want/need from your management system and I'm always willing to test possible improvements to help me be for effective.<br>Thank you in advance<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2009 at 13:30 | learning as I go</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
