I know there have been some discussions previously on OmniFocus, but now that AF4 doesn't need a "page" concept, I wondering how folks might be implementing it. Thanks!<br><br>Gory details, please.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 September 2009 at 3:58 | ds</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm happily using Omnifocus. I keep things simple: one list, with a task that is just a typed line (--------) as, well, "the line" between the open or active and closed or backlog lists. <br><br>When I get to the situation where I have done a complete pass of the Closed list without doing any of the tasks, then, instead of "highlighting" all those remaining tasks, I assign them a context called "Review". (I don't use any other contexts. They simply don't make any sense for the way I work.) And I then enter a new line at the end of the Active list, which now becomes the new Closed list.<br><br>The next time I cycle back to the beginning of the list, those "highlighted" ("Review") tasks are abandoned, re-entered, or put into a reminder system as appropriate.<br><br>If I need to keep track of where I am on a list, I put a dot (option-8) before the task I'm currently working on.<br><br>I use the "Clean Up" command to instantly delete completed tasks. (Cheap thrill!) Deleted tasks are archived automatically so I can always go back and review them if I want to.<br><br>Things I love about Omnifocus:<br><br>The interface is clean and elegant. I can keep things simple and uncluttered. If I need a note (a URL, a phone number) there's a jolly little drop down note area that then disappears.<br><br>New tasks enter at the bottom of the list, just like my old paper list.<br><br>I can keep one list, and it's always with me, and it's always up-to-date. I sync between my laptop and my iPhone via MobileMe and that syncing ability is a dream come true for me. <br><br>When I think of something I need to do, out comes the phone and on the list it goes. No more lost slips of papers, emails to myself to process, or winging it because "the list" is in the OTHER notebook which is at the OTHER work site.<br><br>Omnifocus isn't cheap but I got a substantial educational discount. For me, it's the second best thing I've ever done for my productivity and peace-of-mind. (Autofocus being the best thing!)<br><br>I have many (paper) project files, and a lot of my project planning is done in those files but I also keep project folders in Omnifocus and I use those jotting down ideas and thinking about the project that I then mesh with the paper files. <br><br>[BTW, and completely off topic, I use a very simplified version of Martin Tarnouth's management system which he wrote about on Edward Tufte's wonderful blog. Every project, no matter how large or small, gets a clear plastic slipcase folder and a cover sheet with its title and I make progress notes on the cover sheet. I also color code all my files, calendar entries, notebooks, etc: orange for teaching, green for making (art) and blue for life.]</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 September 2009 at 5:18 | Liz I.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here is how I do it. I have three projects of type "Single Actions" (icons are boxes): Backlog, Active, Someday. Someday has status "On hold", it's for stuff that I may do some day but not currently doing.<br><br>My view setup is:<br>Ungrouped, Unsorted, Available actions, Any duration, Any flag state.<br><br>When I'm working on the back log, I click the Backlog project, and work on things as per instruction. Any thing that is finished gets crossed out. Any thing that needs further work is duplicated (cmd-d), the original one is crossed out, the new one is dragged to the Active project.<br><br>When I'm working on the active list, I do the same except that I leave the duplicated task in place. Regularly I select every task (cmd-a), right-click, and sort -&gt; date added. This way re-added task go to the end.<br><br>When I go through the backlog without doing anything and need to review it, I select all, right-click, set flag. I then take every action from the Active project and put them in the Backlog project. Next time I work on the back log I review every flagged task, discarding them (delete or put in Someday) or re-entering them in the active list if necessary.<br><br>When I think of new tasks I enter them using the quick input panel, it automatically adds them at the end.<br><br>I think that's about it. I works quite well. If you have any question, don't hesitate to ask away.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 September 2009 at 9:15 | Brab</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Liz - thank you for this wonderful link to Edward Tufte's site - what a find!  Question: are the clear folders like manilla file folders, only clear plastic?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 September 2009 at 11:50 | Claudia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You're welcome! His site is amazing, in a wonderfully geeky way.<br><br>There are plastic file folders, but I prefer the clear plastic "project files" that are open on the top and side and don't have a tab. They're cheaper and easier to stack and file for me. (I have a wall thing that holds current projects and a rolling cart with plastic hanging file folders that holds "not-right-now" projects.)<br><br>Office Depot has them:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/741341/Office-Depot-Brand-Poly-Project-Files/">http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/741341/Office-Depot-Brand-Poly-Project-Files/</a><br><br>If anyone is overworked, underpaid, works at multiple sites or if, like me, you get distracted and absent-minded, these are great, because there are no loose papers and there's a physical LUMP that you can easily find.<br><br>For me, filing is the (other) secret of happiness because there is nothing more stressful for me than trying to find that piece of paper I need to proceed . . .</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 September 2009 at 14:45 | Liz I.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'd prefer to work on paper, but I've found OF has some powerful advantages. I'm very project focused, with lots of deadline-driven projects, and I need an electronic record of what I've done. Most of my information arrives electronically, and I find that writing down a phone number in a task list, and then when the task is completed re-recording the number in my database, is overhead I can do without.<br><br>OmniFocus works very well for combining these requirements with AF4.<br><br>My OF setup currently looks like this:<br><br>- Projects filed in two folders: "Live" (actively working on) and "Stack" (everything else).<br><br>- Three contexts: "Open", "Closed" and "About". Open &amp; Closed are, of course, my open and closed lists. "About" is short for "Out &amp; About" and has reminders of stuff to get or do when I'm in town.<br><br>- Perspectives to fit my work habits. My main operating perspective shows a flat list of tasks sorted by Date Added, with the newest at the top (in a deadline driven job, this works better than the paper default of the newest at the bottom). <br>Within this perspective I can look at contexts/lists separately, or all my tasks at once if I click on the main "Contexts" container.<br><br>With a press of a hotkey I can also switch to a list of projects with their respective tasks arrayed beneath each project. That allows me to quickly survey what's ahead, what's missing and what's redundant to each project. This isn't as easy in the paper version.<br><br>It's an easy matter to drag tasks between open and closed lists, and easy to enter them into the right project and right task list in the first place - one of the beauties of OF. <br><br>The currently active task gets a flag. <br><br>In a future, less complicated life, I'd like to have my life contained within the battered covers of a leather organiser covered in travel stains and memories. I could do that now, with determination, but it would be far less efficient than what I've got. I don't think OmniFocus can be bettered as an electronic solution.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2009 at 0:29 | Matt C.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wow, thanks for those detailed write-ups.

Given the way I've implemented AF in OF, though, it's not really an inconvenience not to have access to perspectives on the iPhone. (I'm still using AF3, incidentally, and haven't tried AF4 yet.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2009 at 22:17 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So, after trying some of this a bit in OmniFocus, I have to ask--why OmniFocus? It seems that you have to limit yourself to just a few contexts or projects (like "open" and "closed") in order to make the AutoFocus magic happen.<br><br>In that case, aren't you sacrificing the potential power of OmniFocus--sorting and filtering when you need it) to run what becomes a fairly basic list?<br><br>Obviously, you need a way to view your AF as simply your AF list, so you can work from it as intended. But I'm still trying to figure out how to do that as well as have the option to use contexts and projects and folders in OF to sometimes zoom in on specific areas.<br><br>Any thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 October 2009 at 13:06 | ds</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ds - simple. I have yet to find a nice looking, easy solution to syncing AF lists between my mac and iphone. I wasn't interested in web-based solutions, so my options were very limited. But now that I'm using OF, I'm in love with it's features.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 October 2009 at 14:32 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi ds:<br><br>My answer's pretty much the same as Avrum's – Omnifocus is the only non-web-based software I've fond that allows for a straightforward implementation of AF, and that I can use on both my iPhone and my Mac with straightforward syncing between the two. (The nearest runner-up, Things, which in various other ways I prefer, can't be used for AF on both the iPhone and the Mac with syncing because of the way the iPhone app handles completed tasks. I posted about this in other threads a while ago.) So I'm OF is the best option for me even though I'm only using a fraction of its capabilities.<br><br>Incidentally, I do use perspectives on the desktop/laptop version of OF – e.g., to see all my errands in one place – and because I'm still using AF3, I have one perspective for forward mode (with "page markers" displayed, but no completed tasks showing, for compactness), one for reverse mode (without page markers, no completed tasks), and one for moving the "on notice" line at the start of each day, when it's important to see the completed tasks, too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 October 2009 at 19:53 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>whoops: "I've fond" ––&gt; "I've found", and "So I'm OF" ––&gt; "So OF"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 October 2009 at 19:55 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@ds: Like Avrum and Martin, I needed synchronization between my laptop and my iPhone and OmniFocus provides that for me.<br><br>As for "sacrificing the potential power of Omnifocus" that matters not to me. I have what I need: simplicity, clarity,  efficiency--and synchronization!.<br><br>For using AF4, that's all I need. And if, in the future, I decide I "need" a more complicated task/time management system, I can always take advantage of the other features of Omnifocus. <br><br>(Not that that is very likely.

At their request, I sent them various crash reports and the like, and they've diagnosed the problem that's afflicting me: there's a bug in the iPhone app which is causing it to "needlessly and excessively optimize the database", and that's causing the slowdown. They're working on it, and hoping (though not promising) to fix it with the next update to the iPhone app. Given the general rapidity with which they seem to fix bugs, I'm optimistic.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 October 2009 at 16:46 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Martin - I was putting up with the slow sync times, but thi weeks fatal sync error was "the straw taht broke...". The fact remains, it takes 3-4 extra steps to do AF4 on Omni vs. FocusPad. Do I REALLY need to send email from Mail to Omni? No. Do I really need a Projects option? Not with AF4. <br><br>I've only been mucking around with Focus Pad for a few hours, but I'm very impressed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 October 2009 at 17:37 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Still happily using AutoFocus and syncing via MobileMe.<br><br>I'm not looking for alternatives. I don't like to tinker with my "to do" system. I just put items on the list, cross them off, put items on, cross them off . . .<br><br>Back to work on a grant application.

I like lots of things about FocusPad, too, but (a) I work my list on my laptop most of the time, (b) I want to use a desktop application for AF on my laptop (as opposed to a web app), and (c) I wouldn't want to do without a tickler system (and would much rather have my ticklers integrated with my working list, at least in the sense of being in the same app). These three things rule out FocusPad for me at the moment – plus the fact that it would slow me down enormously to type everything into my iPhone – and given what Tony's said, (b) will continue to rule it out.<br><br>Incidentally, I originally switched from Things to OF because you can't do AF3 in Things if you're syncing regularly with the iPhone app. I've still yet to try AF4, but it has occurred to me that the reason one can't do AF3 with Things (on both Mac and iPhone) doesn't come up with AF4. There's a different problem with AF4 and Things, however: no simple way of highlighting collections of items. That rules out using Things for AF4 even *without* the desire to sync between laptop/desktop and iPhone. Sad to say.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 October 2009 at 2:53 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Martin - totally sucks that AF4 will most probably take off the way GTD did.
