Could you elaborate?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Mark Forster responded:<br>&lt;&lt;&lt;You have a serious problem because the system won't work if that is the case. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>The rules say that a page is "closed" if column 2 is full.  For a page like that, the rules are very clear:<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt; 2. When you visit a page which is full (i.e. has no space left in Column 2), all tasks on that page must be either actioned or dismissed.  Dismissal only applies to tasks in Column 1. Tasks in Column 2 must always be actioned. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Since that page will imminently disappear, I don't see why it's a pressing problem.<br><br>It only becomes a pressing problem if a quickly-filling Column 2 is a chronic experience.   But in my experience so far, this is a situation where SAFv3 really shines.  <br><br>Overloading column 2 is a painful experience.  It forces you to deal with all those tasks you've loaded in column 2, while column 1 items on future pages get neglected, and the system overall starts to really slow down.  But the pain of this experience is actually valuable.  <br><br>For example, I am like Matt, in that I have lots of unfinished work, and lots of little urgent things that come up during the day (some of them recurring Outlook reminders).  This tends to overload column 2.   <br><br>So, I am learning to do the following:<br><br>(1) If the system is forcing me to work on long-term projects at the expense of more pressing work, because I keep re-entering that unfinished long-term project in Column 2, then I need to break down that long-term project into smaller chunks, and enter those chunks into the system, rather than the whole project.  (I can do this mentally, or literally by the way I write the task).   This raises attention on that particular project and makes me think through it better -- what really needs to be done, and when, and why.<br><br>(2) If my recurring urgent tasks are filling up column 2, I can revisit those tasks and see if they are really as urgent and as necessary as I think they are.   It basically forces an audit of these recurring tasks -- and like the AF4rev2? experience showed, these recurring tasks can sometimes make up the bulk of the items on our lists.  <br><br>(3) If I am STILL getting too many unfinished things in column 2, this seems to be a sign that I have taken on too much work, and need to scale back my commitments.  (Column 2 seems to be the gauge for measuring overload - a feature that AF1 was lacking.  DWM was also good at gauging overload, but the SAF column 2 gives much faster feedback!)   <br><br>In the past few days, I have already learned to treat Column 2 with respect, otherwise it will bite me.  In other words, the pain of dealing with a chronically overloaded Column 2 is already teaching me to say "NO" more effectively.   DWM wasn't really able to do that...<br><br>So, yes, an overloaded column 2 is a problem, but if you just keep following the rules, it seems like the problem takes care of itself and teaches better habits in the process.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2011 at 23:24 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>Has this situation actually happened to you (or anyone else)?<br><br>I ask because I never envisaged when I wrote the rules that anyone would succeed in filling Column 2 of the last page before Column 1 was filled.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 0:19 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Are you obeying the rule that if both columns are full the page gets dismissed?  It seems like perhaps not.

Either way, it is auto regulating so there is no real problem there.<br><br>I find it fascinating that this second column use for the re-entered (non finished) items functions EXACTLY like the "Work in Progress Limit" on a Kanban with the added benefit of no hard number of things you can work on at the same time. It auto regulates itself by overloading you if you overload it. Everyone will have their sweet spot of things to be done at the same time so it may vary depending on your comfort zone.<br><br>One other thing it highlights is something I was saying in my last video about having a lot of maintenance being no problem but few projects can be effectively tackled at the same time!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 1:47 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>&lt;&lt;Are you obeying the rule that if both columns are full the page gets dismissed? It seems like perhaps not. If you were filling things that quickly the pages would quickly disappear and you'd be zipping around in no time flat!&gt;&gt;<br><br>Is this right? I don't see any limit in the system to the number of pages you can fill with column 2 tasks. So if you are badly overloaded and suffer an urgent task explosion, you could in theory find yourself working through pages which are mainly or only column 2.These ones can't be dismissed: only actioned: they may disappear more quickly but you will have to spend longer on each pass.<br><br>Whether the page gets dismissed or not, the pressure Seraphim discussed will exist. An elegant way to force the trade off between reaction and control.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 9:14 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will, it's impossible to have multiple pages with active, unfinshed tasks. Why? Because you are never allowed to leave a page with unfinished tasks. You must work all of them.  Further, if you fill a page completely, you finish what's left in column 2 and dismiss the page. Thus if you keep filling column 2, you won't have many pages left.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 13:35 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark asked:<br>&lt;&lt;&lt; Has this situation actually happened to you (or anyone else)? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>It did happen in SAFv1.  It hasn't happened to me yet, in SAFv3, although it's come pretty close once or twice.  I wanted to think through how to deal with it ahead of time, since I've come pretty close to having it happen (plus others were asking about it, also in theoretical terms).  I don't want it to happen and then I have the "deer in the headlights" reaction.  <br><br>For me, it's been a useful thought exercise.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 16:12 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>I think that is right for almost everyone, almost all of the time.<br><br>I am only talking about the case where I am out of control. If I accept a lot of urgent tasks, there might only be a few spaces in column 2 for re-entered tasks. Then re-entered tasks would overflow to following pages without limit, so far as I can see.<br><br>Or, worse, I might just keep putting urgent tasks down.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 17:16 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is all hypothetical, right?  Because it seems improbable that all the pages (30 lines each) fill up simultaneously with urgent tasks that arise on each. Also if you get many urgents I expect they are small. You write them on the current page and kill them. Of you get soo many urgents that they spill over multiple pages, you need to rethink either "urgent" or else keep them out of the system.<br><br>SF is the first system here that purported to do something with urgent stuff, but only occassional emergencies were envisioned. If your job is rapid fire fighting, whatever you did pre-SF you need that still.   <br><br>If the problem is starting and reentering too many things, you need to either start fewer things, or have smaller chunks that you finish sooner.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 19:40 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Is this right? I don't see any limit in the system to the number of pages you can fill with column 2 tasks.&gt;&gt;<br><br>This is something which hasn't been spelled out properly in the new consolidated rules, though it was in the original ones. What is supposed to happen is that if you are on the last page, unfinished tasks are re-entered in Column 2 of the earliest active page of the list. In other words, when you reach the end of the list you go back to the beginning.<br><br>When there is no more room in Column 2 of a page for more tasks, then the tasks go into the first subsequent page which has room.  If it's the last page which has no room, then the tasks will be entered on the first page using the same principle - when you reach the end of the list you go back to the beginning.<br><br>So you can see that if someone grossly overloads Column 2 with urgent tasks, it is in fact possible to fill all the Column 2s in the list.<br><br>I will shortly be doing an amendment to clarify this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 21:14 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Will, it's impossible to have multiple pages with active, unfinshed tasks.
