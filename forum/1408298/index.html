If the action is not obvious from the subject, I type in the action at the front of the subject before hitting &lt;alt&gt; + S to save.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 6:04 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I personally don't like to respond to emails immediately; I prefer to let it simmer in the back of my head where a purposeful answer will mature and I can write a response that is concise and of value. To accommodate that, I have 3 folders for my emails and I NEVER leave anything in the inbox!<br><br><br>Folders:<br><br>ACTION: This is where I put emails that I know what I want to do with them but just don't have the time to do now. A good example of that would be that I'm at the store and think of a task to do at my computer. I email myself and put the resulting email in that folder to clear my inbox. Another would be correspondence chess moves my father sends me. I see it on my phone and put it in that folder for when I get to my computer later. I review this folder everytime I get to my computer and there is never more then 3 things in there at a time.<br><br>PENDING: Is for stuff that will come up or that I don't know exactly what I want to do with. A good example would be part of a project that I have to tackle but cannot until 1 or 2 days. Or an invitation to a concert that I'm not decided on if to go to or not. There is usually up to 5 things in there at a time. I look at it about once a day.<br><br>WAITING FOR: is for stuff I'm waiting a reply to and that I actually care about it. If I dont receive it in the next 2 days, I email back. Hence I look at it about once a day. There is rarely more then 3 things in there at a time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 6:22 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>The beauty of NEO is that there is no one way you have to do things, and in fact for most purposes you don't *have* to do anything at all. You can leave it to the program to sort out.<br><br>I'll give my best answer to your examples. But bear in mind that you don't have to do it the same way.<br><br>&lt;&lt; For example, let's say you get an email that has an embedded one-off task that you can't do immediately. You need to do the task "later" ("in the normal course of working your system"). What would you write in your SF list? And what would you do with the email? &gt;&gt;<br><br>When the email is from someone who only writes to you occasionally, you don't need to do anything to the email. The program files it automatically by Correspondent. So all I would do is put "Reply Bill Jones" on my list. When I was ready to do the task, I'd just go to Bill Jone's file and reply to the email.<br><br>&lt;&lt;  Let's say you got an email that has an embedded task related to a current project with one of the volunteer organizations that you work with. What would you write in your SF list in this case? And what would you do with the email? &gt;&gt;<br><br>I'd tag the email with the name of the project, and put "Reply Liz Smith re Africa Project". Then when the task was ready to be done, I could either go to the Africa Project File or Liz Smith's file.<br><br>Alternatives I might use in certain circumstances:<br><br>- leave the email as Active so that it continues to appear in my Active Mail folder.<br>- tag it as a To Do<br>- flag it (with a date if necessary).<br><br>I have tasks to regularly check the contents of the To Do and Flagged folders, so there's a fall-back if for some reason I miss it otherwise.<br><br>You can also add notes to emails, so that you can remember what exactly it was that you needed to do with it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 9:40 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I should add that when I do a batch of mail, I move all the contents of the inbox to a "Process now" folder (&lt;ctrl&gt;+A, drag). When I have gone through the process now folder, I drag it to a "2011 Reference" folder.<br><br>This guarantees that the inbox is periodically cleared. I find that trying to reply as I clear almost always slows me down. The purpose of going through the inbox is to know what I need to do. Doing it is driven through SF. In theory.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 10:21 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I should add that when I do a batch of mail, I move all the contents of the inbox to a "Process now" folder (&lt;ctrl&gt;+A, drag).

The program automatically separates out those emails which still require processing, and automatically puts emails into a "2011" Folder.

If I got addition mails relating to this I put it also in this folder. If i had answered (finished) I delete the contend of the folder or move the folder to a folder called "4archive". An label the folder back to ol2_ (=thus I know its empty).<br><br>BTW I do the same on my harddisk and usb-device. There I have folders like:<br>2Action<br>-- s01<br>-- s02<br>-- and so on<br>(s = usb stick)<br>Thus, a task could look like:<br>ol2, s01: Mail Clark price list from BigMuscleStore (* in s01 could be a relating document).<br>=&gt; this way I always find support material very quick.<br><br>- Jens</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 15:52 | jens</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>jens:<br><br>My advice is to start using NEO!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 16:10 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I used to use a linking system (via Things on the Mac/iPhone) to associate tasks with the email messages that spawned them.  But now I've converted to paper for my SF3 list, so I use a different strategy.  Looking back, all the cool automated linking, tagging, syncing seems like more trouble than it was worth (and it did cost quite a few $$).<br><br>I try to manage email by following Merlin Mann's Inbox Zero guidelines (excellent video at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925#).">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925#).</a> I keep a sticker on my computer that says "d.a.qa.fta.ea" to remind me of the five choices for dealing with each message: (1) Delete, (2) Archive, (3) Quick-reply + Archive, (4) Forward (delegate) + Tickle (followup reminder) + Archive, or (5) Enter + Archive. These are listed in my preferred order. <br><br>Only in Choice 5 do I actually enter the task in my SF3 list. If I need to refer to the body of that email message, I put a date reminder on the task entry and/or print the message to keep in my Pending folder. Since I archive email into monthly mbox (text) files, it's relatively easy to find an old but important message and its associated conversation thread.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 16:39 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ubi:<br><br>I advise you to start using NEO too!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 18:28 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use Gmail.<br><br>If the mail can be replied to quickly, I do it.<br><br>If it contains a task, I enter it in my SF notebook (a large format Moleskine cahier).

I have a folder in Outlook 2010 entitled "E-Action Support".  I move the email that has a task in it to that folder.  I then immediately make an entry in my SF3 list for this task and put the following after the task:  (EAS).  The "E" of course is for Email Action Support folder.  I also have a regular "Action Support" folder on a file stand on my desk where I keep non-project related papers that come to my attention that need to be actioned.  I make the same kind of notation in my SF3 list, minus the "E".<br><br>I have found in the heat of the day that it is VERY important to make these entries into the SF3 list as soon as possible, if not immediately.

In column 1 I have a recurring task call "inbox" zero. When ever I hit it I do the following:<br><br>1. Delete any garbage emails that have accumulated since last time.<br>2. Anything needs filing goes in the 1 single reference folder I have. Search on the Mac Makes it unnecessary  in my world to use folders any longer. Search can find anything I need just as fast.<br>3. If an email needs action then. It gets written into column 1 or 2 as appropriate and filed in reference.<br>4.
