However I've not really been following a 'system' as such. <br><br>I believe the recurrent difficulty I have had with all AF versions is that I soon become what I believe Anthony Robbins refers to as 'overchunked', whereby one has many broken down items scattered over a very long list. On the other hand, a project that has not been broken down can be overwhelming leading to procrastination. <br><br>Although it may work against original AF intentions, has anyone tried defining items in a way that they can be 'completed in a day'. If so, how has it worked out?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 November 2010 at 14:35 | leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>leon:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I believe the recurrent difficulty I have had with all AF versions is that I soon become what I believe Anthony Robbins refers to as 'overchunked', whereby one has many broken down items scattered over a very long list.

My approach is to get the other chunks out of the list and organize them into projects.  In AF I record the first task and the project it belongs to.  When that task completes I enter another one from the project.  This has worked very well for me, and seems like it will be even better in SuperFocus.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 November 2010 at 15:07 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Alan, <br><br>Be great to hear more about it Mark, when you are ready. <br><br>Perhaps I meant what can I do 'in one go' rather than 'completed in a day' ...but it's difficult to define somehow</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 November 2010 at 19:55 | leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think it is very important to write tasks in chunks that can be actioned in a day or less.  For most of us, if we are building a house (a project not a task) do not really need build a house on a list, we are not going to forget we are building a house.  If we have lots of projects we may need a projects list if we are not always working on the tasks.  <br><br>For most of the time, I feel it is helpful to focus on tasks and to do so in a manner that causes progress like having them be completed in a time frame we can relate to like a day.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 November 2010 at 22:25 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Mark, are you saying you are working on an AF4 tweak that will make it able to work on projects efficiently?<br><br>God bless!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 November 2010 at 23:01 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym<br><br>Yes, I hope so - but I'm still on Day 1 so too early to tell how it will work.<br><br>In response to the point made by Gerry about the size of tasks, I believe this varies according to the nature of the time management system being used. For instance I think 3-T works best with larger chunks than SuperFocus. The version of AF4 I am trying out at the moment probably works best with larger chunks than either.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 November 2010 at 23:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>&lt;&lt;Yes, I hope so - but I'm still on Day 1 so too early to tell how it will work.&gt;&gt;<br><br>You DO realize that a time management system that efficiently handles projects AS WELL as individual tasks with as little overhead and as efficiently as AF is kinda like the HOLY GRAIL of time management, right? ^___^<br><br>God bless!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 2:10 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 9:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Mark, I'm starting to kinda hate you for making me excited AGAIN to test a new system (^___^), but how's it going? And do you think it can be adapted to other systems such as AF1, SAF, and DWM as well?<br><br>God bless!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 13:47 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hm, very interesting.  My reasons for jumping from My System to SAF were two:<br>1. I saw a way to imitate my system's benefits within SAF.<br>2. I saw a way to deeply integrate my project system into SAF.<br><br>The first made the switch conceivable, but the second clinched it for me.  I'm very early in that integration process, but it looks like it's going to resemble SAF embedded in a project-level variation of AF4, resulting in a total system.  And it's actually much simpler than you might guess.  <br><br>I wonder whether Mark's thinking on a similar wave length.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 14:20 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>Would you elbaroate more on your project management system? It sounds interesting (possibility of integration with AF).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 16:46 | Navigare</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, <br><br>While I have not tried SF TT is working great with me with task doable in less than a day.  Quite frequently the tasks are very quick to do, which makes the system work well.  I frequently get many more than three tasks a day done.  I also wrote about goals somewhere the way to get lots of goals done is to complete many short lists and this principle seems to work with TT as well.  <br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 16:53 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry, <br><br>I'm glad to hear it's working well for you. Unfortunately I am finding it difficult to stick to *any* one system for more than 2-3 days. I have a problem - and I believe it's that at some level I need a constant novelty factor or distraction from real life. And I suppose it's an interest also. <br><br>I'd like to commit to your method for a minimum of 30 days and 'then' evaluate my experience. But I'm finding it a challenge to do this!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 21:28 | leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Leon,<br><br>You want a time management system with a constantly renewing novelty factor? Why not try DWM2? As I had said many times before, because of its time-based dismissal system you can process it in many, many ways.  It is not unusual for me to process my own DWM2 list in the styles of AF1, AF2, AF3, AF4, DWM, "ping-pong", and even random ways in one day.  Heck, you can use 3TS with it, and the "Ping-Pong" style even emulates SAF! <br><br>To be honest, after experiencing DWM2, I now cannot stand using other TMS's because I quickly get bored with them.  I think this flexibility is one major factor in my sticking with DWM2 for almost a month now, and I'm still going strong ^__^<br><br>God bless!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 22:40 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon,<br><br>For me I have really found TT to be great.  This is the first time something new has come out (SF) and I just did not feel the need to try it out.  I am not saying you will have the same reaction but I found TT very comfortable and it handled what I needed done.  I have a lot on my plate at this point and since it is getting handled I am happy.  Part of it for me is when I see lots of new rules I get turned off.  I crave simplicity.  Best of luck<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 23:59 | Gerry</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
