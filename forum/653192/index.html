The reason I ask is, there are 3-4 items on this same page that I will dismiss once this item has been actioned.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 22:25 | Joe Jones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Okay, I think multiple people are asking the same question including me. I saw Mel ask similar question in the DIT+AF thread. I would love to get this question answered as well. There have been many ideas - break it down further and do a very tiny bit or rephrase the item in order to push it to the end of the list. However, all of these seem to be workaround for a basic question - I have a final couple of items to do on a page and this is not the time to do it (not because I don't want to do it, but because I can't do it). I don't want to dismiss it but I want to defer it (may be by few hours or a couple of days depending on the item). <br><br>For example, I have to buy a voice recorder for my kid to record her classes beginning next week. I need to buy it before the classes start. However, I expect to have time to do it this only on the weekend. But, this is the last item on a page. I feel rephrasing this just to push it to the last page is not clearly in the spirit of AF. Common sense tells me, just wait on it till this weekend but don't dismiss the item or page because this is not an item that I am procrastinating on. I will continue to cycle through rest of the pages. When I hit this page this weekend, I will action the item. <br><br>I can see how this could be abused and create a loophole to procrastinate. But there are legitimate items (waiting for, errand items are typical of these kind) where you may need to defer them rather than dismissing them. <br><br>Any thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 23:03 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Joe:<br><br>If you can't take action on something for a week or so then what is it doing on your list? You should have it in some sort of reminder (diary, Outlook, tickler file, etc.) to be brought up when you are able to do it.<br><br>And since "standing out" means that the item feels ready to do, there's a contradiction in saying an item is standing out if you aren't ready to do it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 23:29 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Greenchutney:<br><br>There's no great mystery about this. If you have only a couple of items on the page, you will presumably have visited the page several times - so there will have already been multiple opportunities to take action on them.If you haven't taken action on them on those previous opportunities, in spite of "wanting to do them", then what guarantee is there that you will do them even if you do defer them? My advice is to follow the instructions and dismiss them. If you do that consistently, you will be more likely to do them on earlier visits to the page.<br><br>Remember that dismissing an item does not prevent you from doing it in the future - it is intended to be an opportunity to reassess it.<br><br>However if an item can't be done for several days, then it shouldn't be on the list at all. It should be in a reminder of some kind, as I wrote in my reply to Joe above.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 23:37 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt; If you can't take action on something for a week or so then what is it doing on your list?<br><br>It just happened that way. That item was entered to ensure that it gets done within a 10 day period. The week's priorities changed. Yes, I could have put this on a calendar to remind me. But then I always think of calendar items as items with a specific time. And clearly that's not the case with this one. Also, if my work lets up, I could potentially action that item later part of the week instead of the weekend. This would not have been an issue if there were 5 items in the page of which 4 could potentially be actioned. This is an end case where that particular item just happens to be the last one left on the page. The way someothers have handled it is to rephrase the item and put it in the end of the list.<br><br>&gt;&gt; And since "standing out" means that the item feels ready to do, there's a contradiction in saying an item is standing out if you aren't ready to do it.<br><br>What I am saying is that there could be situations where I don't want to dismiss an item just because it is the last item on the page and it is not standing out. I would like to defer it. Perhaps, as you suggested, I may need to take it "outside" of AF lists to handle this situation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2009 at 0:00 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Greenchutney:<br><br>If the week's priorities changed, then it would seem to be an ideal opportunity to review the task, which is what dismissal is all about. AF is designed to be able to cope with shifting priorities and dismissing items is part of that process.<br><br>In AF a reminder is used as a signal to put an item on the main list, rather than that it has to be done that day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2009 at 0:14 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, your comment "If you do that consistently, you will be more likely to do them on earlier visits to the page." is really helpful.  I guess that, despite believing all you say about dismissing there's still a degree of concern about doing so.  It's easy for me to find reasons why I can justify leaving an item on the list but in actual fact the truth is more likely to be that I could have actioned it if I had really wanted to.  The ability to justify leaving it there is therefore potentially hiding what the system is telling me. Interesting ......  <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2009 at 0:20 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, that's food for thought. I have always attached a different connotation to "dismissal". In my mind, dismissal was a final act where I have made a decision that it will not be actioned at least for a foreseeable future. So, I guess I was trying to differentiate between dimissing the items that you are committed to doing in the short term (I call this deferral) vs. items that you won't get to (I consider this as true dismissal). <br><br>Perhaps, there should be a step where one reviews all the dismissed items to put back into the AF list if appropriate at a regular interval. Then it may relieve this feeling of finality of dismissing certain items.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2009 at 0:32 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Greenchutney;<br><br>I interpret Dismissing as you do in your post.<br><br>Although I started off with a manual system and got going with it, I have been using AF with ListPro for over a week now.  So it;s easy for me to tag each item, if I want to, regarding its fate.<br><br>As I work abroad, there are many things I can't physically do while on assignment, and vice versa.  But I don't want to forget these tasks as they occur to me, so they start off in my AF list.<br><br>When I review the page, I'll tag some as "Defer To Do Later".  Then if I want to do them at   a time and place when I am able to, I either change them to "Reminder" or "Task Scheduled" when I copy and paste the text into Outlook, which is what Mark suggests.<br><br>When Outlook reminds me I can either decide to do them there and then, or I can restore them to AF to be picked up during scanning.  I see this as an example of the flexibility of AF.<br><br>In scanning the pages, Listpro (the way I've set mine up) I am able to focus on AF tasks without yet any status and see which stands out to do now.<br><br>A real example of the Defer To Do Later process are the tasks I have told Outlook to remind me tomorrow evening when I have to spend over six hours at Johannesburg Airport en route home in the UK.  I've scheduled them, or have reminders set up for the time slot because i know I'll have decent wi-fi connection in the KLM Lounge, the Zambia internet access being very slow and flaky.  Included in the tasks are: online VAT returns, checking my company's bank and credit card statements (I have a firewall and other security measures running always!), long emails with attachments, making Skype calls etc.<br><br>Works for me, which is the most important thing.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2009 at 10:31 | Roger J (currently in Zambia)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Greenchutney:<br><br>The instructions say:<br><br>"Highlighting rejected items helps you to review them easily."<br><br>All you have to do is put a task "Review dismissed items" on your list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2009 at 12:41 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, That works when one changes the meaning of dismissal.

But if you come across something you can't action for a few days, then working out when you *can* do it, and scheduling if necessary, counts as doing some work on it in my book.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2009 at 22:54 | Ed C</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
