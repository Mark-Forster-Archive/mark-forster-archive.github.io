The neural maps are constantly changing and re-wiring depending on what we're doing and how we train them.  Neurons that fire together, wire together.<br><br>So more and more people have "ADHD" symptoms, trouble with attention management, trouble with discipline and getting things done, and procrastination.<br><br>I think we can start thinking about procrastination and difficulty with getting things done as the results of accidentally re-wiring our brains in negative ways.<br><br>For example, in my situation, I have often interrupted myself in the middle of my work in order to check a chat-room.  Other people might interrupt themselves for different reasons, such as checking a news site, or a forum, or email, or facebook, etc.<br><br>So by constantly interrupting ourselves in the middle of work, we are actively training our brains to have trouble with focusing on one task at a time.  We are effectively training our brains to acquire "ADHD" symptoms.<br><br>So how do we combat this?  How do we stop training our attention to wander, and start training it to focus and be productive?<br><br>Well, meditation is known as a good way to reduce procrastination and increase attentional control.<br><br>I also think that AutoFocus can probably help.  It forces us to pick 1 task, work on it for however long we feel like, and then come back to the list and pick the next task (perhaps something fun to alternate).  By following that kind of system you'd be training your brain to focus on one thing at a time, and reduce the multitasking.<br><br>Also, the Pomodoro technique could be a great trainer.  Train yourself to do 25 minutes of the task at hand, without any multitasking, and then take a break.  Actually the hardest part is stopping at exactly 25 minutes once you've gotten going, but this is also training the brain to be a better task switcher.<br><br>Maybe 25 minutes is much too long for a long time procrastinator/attention mismanager.<br><br>Perhaps there are a more effective ways to re-train the brain and reduce procrastination, by increasing attention control.<br><br>What do you think?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 0:12 | James R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi James,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I think we can start thinking about procrastination and difficulty with getting things done as the results of accidentally re-wiring our brains in negative ways.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I'm not taking issue with that idea, I'm sure it is true of some.  However, in my circumstance (and others may bear the commonality of this experience out) trouble began when I was a child.  My brain came "prewired" the wrong way, if wiring was the problem at all ;-)<br><br>So, once again, before we prescribe a solution, it probably pays to dicide what our own personal problem really is.  Some people really ARE overwhelmed and need to chunk down and do those kinds of things.  Others are more troubled by fear and need to deal with what is going on there.  Some of us have problems with time and consequences and so that calls for another approach.  Your suggestion about interruptions, etc. are going to be helpful to all of us, but perhaps some more than others.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 10:25 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's all about wrestling with your internal monitors.

You're right.  That's why the inventor of the Pomodoro started by challenging himself to do 10 minutes, and over a lengthy period built up has stamina to achieve 25.  So start with a 5 or 10 minute commitment, or even just a 1 minute commitment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 17:16 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike,<br><br>The point was that we're constantly wiring our brains every single day, based on what we're doing, how our body is being used, etc.<br><br>So it isn't necessarily an issue of being pre-wired as a kid because we can do brain training to re-wire and strengthen our weak areas.  Our wiring as a kid is not permanant!<br><br>For example, the book describes a woman that couldn't read clock faces, and had trouble understanding relationships between symbols, past tense, etc.  At the age of 28, she started doing various brain training that she devised herself.  She rigorously trained herself to read up to 10 clock faces with flash cards.  After awhile she started noticing side benefits, that she could understand relationships between things and math better.  She was able to cure herself of a neurological mis-wiring problem that she had lived with for her whole life.<br><br>There's no reason we can't do brain training to improve attention management, discipline, etc.  No reason why we can't devise daily activities that incorporate some of that, and progressively build our productivity _ability_ up.<br><br>Alan,<br><br>I tried doing pomodoro for a couple days, I did about 5-6 pomodoros each day.  I guess the hard part is sticking with the pomodoro plan and staying productive, rather than the doing the actual pomodoros themselves.<br><br>I don't have trouble with 25 minutes, once I get going I find it hard to stop...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 22:37 | James R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>James,<br><br>Maybe I was not clear, which is probably why you missed my point ... brain wiring based on experience only explains some things .... and obviously not behavior which precedes that experience.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 22:57 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike,<br><br>I understood your point, and I gave an example of a woman that was able to overcome her neural mis-wiring that she was born with.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 June 2010 at 16:17 | James R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>James wrote "There's no reason we can't do brain training to improve attention management, discipline, etc. No reason why we can't devise daily activities that incorporate some of that, and progressively build our productivity _ability_ up."<br><br>I tried once to develop a habit of being persistent, but I couldn't stick with it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 June 2010 at 12:49 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I used to be indecisive...but now I'm not so sure.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 June 2010 at 10:51 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here is a monumental example of the little and often approach to large tasks. <br>No procrastination here.  <br>And he says he is only having fun!<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4832527121139830698#">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4832527121139830698#</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 August 2010 at 8:57 | JR</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That guy is amazing.
