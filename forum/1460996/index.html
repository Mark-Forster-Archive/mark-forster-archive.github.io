However it was rather a blunt instrument as far as timing was concerned and also the compulsory nature of the tasks started to raise resistance to the system after working with it for some time.<br><br>So to make it easier to adjust the timing I have blended it with the rule about where urgent tasks are entered, together with the "snooze" rule. The "snooze" rule also reduces the compulsory nature of the rules without - I hope - reducing their grip.<br><br>So essentially what is happening is that C1 and C2 form two separate lists which are worked on in turn. C1 tasks are only worked on if they are selected to be worked on, and C2 tasks are always worked on unless they are selected not to be worked on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2011 at 23:08 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nice blend!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 April 2011 at 2:41 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been doing the C2 before C1 by sorting my Toodledo list with "Priority : Forwards", so my C2 task with priority "3 Top" is at the top of the list.

It makes things move along faster.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; Urgent tasks are entered on the current page's C2 until you've started on C1. Once you've started on C1, then urgent tasks go on the next page's C2. &gt;&gt;<br><br>My rule generally gives the same effect, but it's based on my level of anxiety:  First consider putting the urgent task in C2 on next page, but if that makes me anxious, then put it in C2 of the current page.   Generally it makes me anxious if I'm still working on C2 of the current page (thus, getting to the next page is relatively distant).  So it produces the same effect, but using a different rule.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; Unfinished tasks always go on the next page's C2. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I am also using this rule.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; Tasks in C2 may be deleted and re-entered in C2 of the next page without being worked on.

But maybe the repeated rewriting will eventually convince you to take action (or demote back to C1).<br><br>I wonder if this rule would have the same effect for people using a software-based approach to SF.   They wouldn't get the "benefit" of repeated rewriting.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; Tasks in Column 2 may be deleted and entered in Column 1 of the last page without being worked on.

In both cases, the feature under test is that C2 tasks can be demoted to C1 at any time. Are there differences in the other details?<br><br>I am watching these experiments with great interest, as I have that "almost perfect" feeling about SF. As you put it earlier, there is a certain timing issue once tasks get into C2. There are times when I want to be in-progress on, say tasks X, Y, and Z, but I cannot or do not want to work on them in a strict rotation. Rather, XYXZZXYYXZ or any such variation (working on little C1 items in between each capital letter). Maybe it feels good to get started on Y in a smallish way in the morning, but the intense work will fit much better in the afternoon.<br><br>There are various ways to achieve this pattern using an external project list and adjusting the notion of "done" to allow these tasks to come and go from C2 at will, but it would be really excellent if some C2 rule adjustment would allow this to happen without the external list and without opening too many loopholes.<br><br>A tall order, but if anyone can figure it out, it's you!

In both cases, the feature under test is that C2 tasks can be demoted to C1 at any time. Are there differences in the other details? &gt;&gt;<br><br>There are two differences, one quite major and the other relatively minor.<br><br>1) The ability to put a C2 task "on snooze" has been removed. All tasks in C2 which are not worked on are "demoted" to C1. I was finding that the "snooze" rule resulted in a collection of tasks which travelled along with me in C2 without getting actioned. This removed a lot of the purpose of C2 and also increased my resistance to working on the list. Now the choice is simple: Work on it or it will be put back in C1.<br><br>2) The second change is more subtle. In the April 14 rules the decision to "snooze" a task or move it to C1 was a positive one. This meant that when you considered a C2 task, you had four choices: i) do some work on it, ii) put it on snooze; iii) move it to C1; iv) leave it for now. This was getting a long way from the simple concept of "do it if it stands out". The April 19 rules restore "Do it if it stands out" as the only option. Any C2 tasks which don't stand out are moved to C1 automatically. Although this may seem to be quite a minor change, it makes working the list more intuitive, which was beginning to get lost.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 April 2011 at 10:19 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I haven't tried it yet, but I like this variation philosophically over the previous one for the reasons Mark sited in #2 above. I felt like there were too many ways to make excuses. But I also found with shifting priorities, I often wanted to demote items to C1 from C2, and did. So I guess I've been doing this variation intermittently. It seems to be the most common sense variation to me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 April 2011 at 13:35 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;Any C2 tasks which don't stand out are moved to C1 automatically.

In this case, I cannot choose a C1 task on the new current page, as a way to alternate my work before reconsidering the same task I had just actioned. For this reason, and since I make rare use of C2 anyway, I'm not adopting this C2-before-C1 variation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 April 2011 at 20:00 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Personally my favourite variation thus far has been this one because of its simplicity:<br><br>&lt;&lt; What this means is basically AF1 with a second column added in which urgent tasks go on the page I am currently working on and unfinished tasks on the next page.

That may be my favorite as well, though I didn't stay on that variation for very long, as I've been following along with most of Mark's experiments.<br><br>I saw it as letting unfinished tasks have a continuum of priorities, from "work on this every page turn," to "work on it a couple of page turns per list cycle." The remnants left in C2 showed me at a glance which projects were in-progress, vs. those in C1 which I hadn't started yet. I remember feeling motivated to follow up on C2 items, without the resistance caused by the standard version's forced march.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 April 2011 at 6:23 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie:<br><br>It's this one:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1453964">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1453964</a><br><br>I can't actually remember why it was that I moved on from there.
