I start to use AF4 but have already some questions.<br><br>So if you can explain to me how you do in practice.  Paper or online solutions.<br><br> <br>1- Where do you put tasks that will be done 2 yr from now ? ( Ex: Renew Passports)<br>2- Some tasks in my "Close list" are for home so I will come in a state where I will pass "Close list" and move to open list directly.<br>3- Some tasks are part of a project. Do you have "side" list for them or all tasks from the project in the "Close/Open list" ?<br><br>Well here are my first questions. <br>Some new soon ? Maybe :D<br><br>Best Regards<br>HEnrik</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2009 at 7:25 | Henrik Ekenberg</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;&gt;  1- Where do you put tasks that will be done 2 yr from now ? ( Ex: Renew Passports)  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>- Paper: A tickler list with each item having the date prepended.  I occasionally print the list from software of some kind and then the list is sorted by date due.  So the passports are likely to be way down at the bottom for a long while.<br><br>- Electronic: Again, a tickler file but this is easier as most applications handle the sorting and reminding.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  2- Some tasks in my "Close list" are for home so I will come in a state where I will pass "Close list" and move to open list directly.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I'm not sure what you are asking here.  Can you clarify?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  3- Some tasks are part of a project. Do you have "side" list for them or all tasks from the project in the "Close/Open list" ?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Absolutely, in both cases I move projects of any size to "side lists"  I even have side lists for grocery shopping, books to read, things to discuss with my wife, etc.  So entries on my list will be: "Shopping", "Read", "Lisa".  Then when the time comes I flip to the appropriate list and I'm good to go with the individual tasks.  The electronic and paper implementations are the same here.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2009 at 8:40 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi,<br><br>Will try to explain my question.... <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2- Some tasks in my "Close list" are for home so I will come in a state where I will pass "Close list" and move to open list directly. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>No tasks in my "Close List" can be done now ( Only home tasks). <br>a/ Send them to review <br>b/ Start to work on open list only <br>c / Create a new Close List ?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2009 at 11:18 | Henrik Ekenberg</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re: ANY list (either open or closed) you process according to the rule.  IOW, don't worry about WHY you don't "feel ready" to do a task, just move on.  IFF there is nothing on the list that you can do and the reason is that you are in the wrong place ... I would "pretend" that you did one and continue processing as usual.  IOW, don't go through the exercise of reviewing items and deleting them just because you are not at home or wherever.   So it would be option B ;-)<br><br>It is for this very reason that people will keep separate home and business lists.  I think the complexity outweighs the advantage.  I just do what I can when and where I can.  In practice, I've never come across the situation where there was nothing left to do because I was in the wrong place.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2009 at 11:37 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I second Mike on how to deal with location-specific tasks.  I work from home 2 days/week and in the office 3 days/week and the workflow is more balanced all around if I have just one list.  Right now my closed list has a bunch of things I can't do in the office, so I'm just pretending they don't exist.  ;^)<br><br>As for things that have to happen in the relatively-distant future: I put reminders in my calendar.  For example, I have a reminder in my calendar for next September to call to schedule maintenance on the furnace (so that we can get it done before we have to turn the thing on for the winter).  When that reminder pops up, I will cycle the task into my AF list and treat it accordingly.  I do the same thing for things like sending out reminders for a monthly meeting and backing up my blogs - calendar events that "trigger" me writing the tasks in my AF book.<br><br>I am not consistent in how I deal with projects - it depends on the project and how my brain is working at any particular time.  Sometimes I put every project-related task I can think of right into AF, other times I just put down the name of the project and maintain a list elsewhere.  Which one works best depends on how I'm feeling about the project and how many other balls I'm trying to keep in the air at the same time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2009 at 17:34 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>About home/work tasks:<br><br>Why worry? You can mark them for review, and the next time you scan the list and find the highlighted tasks, you have the option to re-enter them at the end of the open list, if you consider that you couldn't work on them for a valid reason. <br><br>I try to be honest with myself, though, not just re-enter them without thinking why they weren't done. Sometimes, there are tasks that I simply won't/can't do. You can delete those, or move them to some kind of "freezer" list, or something.<br><br>In my case, after I highlight tasks, I usually have at least one day before I'm back to the closed list. Knowing that, I put an extra effort when I'm back home to "save" some tasks. It works. It really stimulates me to move things forward, even if a little (remember that just working a little on them is enough).<br><br>If I didn't have that "push", these tasks would stay stagnant forever, since when I'm home, I just want to have dinner, and watch a movie or something.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2009 at 21:34 | Walter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here's a thought: It could take a couple days to finish a closed list.  When it's done, that giant open list becomes a closed list and same thing again.  At the end of it all, anything remaining on that closed list is there because over a few days you never touched it. I doubt it was because you never went home!  So why really have you been ignoring that item?  Process the idea, and setup a new task that you will do.<br><br>Having said that, I do two lists.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2009 at 21:51 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yeah, but speaking from past experience, I have been in some serious crunch situations where I only went home to shower and sleep and then was back at work 5 hours later.  There was no way I could do anything at home ... and in one case it lasted for a month!  Now I grant that particular case was beyond extreme, but nonetheless, there could easily be cases where one might not be able to work around the house for a week.  So I stand by my recommendation to simply ignore home tasks until you get HOME ... i.e. have a real day or two at home where work is possible.  THEN if it does not get done, they must go.<br><br>I agree that another viable approach is to review them all and then rewrite them.  But that is a kind of busy work exercise if you know damn well that work is progressing at "work" and can not POSSIBLY be done at home.  In such a case, even if I drew a line because I ran out of work projects to do, I doubt I'd rewrite a whole lot of home chores just to follow the rules.  I'd probably just leave them highlighted and keep on cycling through them until I got home and had a chance to do them.<br><br>Just my own particular approach.  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 October 2009 at 0:56 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It depends.<br><br>As has been said by so many on this forum and other places, it is important what works for YOU, whether it is paper/electronic/simple/complex.<br><br>As my fee earning work is abroad from the UK, I have to use Contexts and have used them in paper and electronic.  Having returned yesterday from an eight week assignment in Africa, I have a bunch of tasks in Contexts (eg Home Office, Home Personal etc) to transfer to Active. <br><br>I'm currently using Alan Baljeu's OneNote approach, it's particularly good at capturing bits of information relative to individual tasks or projects.  For example, one project in my three weeks back at home is to upgrade my notebook from XP to Windows 7, so this page in Open Note is populated with web links and other snippets of information.<br><br>Aluta continua.<br><br>The AF forum seems to me to have "slowed down" of late, to be expected,  but it's still full of interesting comments and tips.  Here's a non AF tip: if you have to check in luggage when flying , always use a hard shell case with corner locks.  Yes, slight heavier when empty, but more impervious to breaking and entering.  Oh, and if you have to use keys, carry them on a cord round the neck, mine has luggage keys, an encrypted USB drive and an ID dog tag with my name, passport numbers and blood group.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2009 at 9:15 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Roger,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  The AF forum seems to me to have "slowed down" of late, to be expected, but it's still full of interesting comments and tips.

Apparently THAT ruse worked.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2009 at 12:58 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, I remember that one. That was a bit more sophisticated. But the Tirpitz had no real way of knowing the forces ranged against it. If it had known it was only three cruisers it would probably have taken the risk of breaking out of the Plate. So the British disinformation was probably quite crucial to the final result of the Tirpitz being scuttled.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2009 at 18:09 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It was the Graf Spee that was scuttled and which brought the Battle of the River Plate to its conclusion.<br><br>I think the Tirpitz was eventually capsized in a Norwegian fjiord after being hit and/or near-missed by "Tall Boy" bombs (about 22,000 lbs each, I think, I used to be a buff on such useless information), some of which my have been dropped by 617 squadron, the original Dam Busters unit.<br><br>I want my USB drive encrypted in case I lose it, as I thought I did in an assignment in Damascus earlier this year.
