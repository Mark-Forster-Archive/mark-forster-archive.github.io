It's very basic at them moment, it doesn't highlight the new posts themselves, only the topic rows on the forum main page. Also note that if you reload the page, the highlights will vanish since the "last visited" time will be the current time. I suggest opening all highlighted topics in new tabs so you don't have to reload the main page. It works in Firefox/Greasemonkey, I haven't tested Opera yet, but Chrome doesn't seem to like it.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforster.net_highlight_new_posts.user.js">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforster.net_highlight_new_posts.user.js</a><br><br>I also updated my "always go to the last page of a topic" script so that not only it goes to the last page, it also scrolls down to the bottom, like if you pressed the end key.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_forum_sho.user.js">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_forum_sho.user.js</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2010 at 21:49 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Okay, it seems to be working in Chrome now.

In Firefox, if I load the forum page, it shows shows updated topics highlighted. Chrome does that too. But if I reload the page in Firefox, the highlighting disappears, because the topics aren't "new" anymore. In Chrome, the highlighting stays upon reloading. But when real new topics show up, Chrome updates too. Do you experience the same or is just me?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2010 at 22:28 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>No highlight upon reloading...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2010 at 22:29 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting ... oh well, I'll figure it out.

For some reason my Chrome always returns 1 as the value of a cookie I set, even though I see the value is different in the cookie data. Luckily, that value was redundant (if was the last number of replies, which isn't necessary since the date changes anyways with new replies), so I modified the script to work without it.

This is excellent!  Thanks!  I had been keeping track of the date/time of my last visit in my recurring "AF Forums" task, but this is a lot easier, especially with the script to auto-scroll to the bottom on the last page.<br><br>Would it also be possible in a future version to highlight the new posts themselves (when you open up each thread in a new tab)?  That would prevent having to re-read a bunch of posts trying to figure out where you left off last.<br><br>Maybe that wouldn't be possible/worth implementing though, since it wouldn't be enough to just go by "last visit" time...some posts can come in while you're reading tabs of other threads, and you would miss these entries the next time you came to the page.  I guess that's what SiteDelta is for.  I could never get that working quite correctly for me, so I uninstalled it.  Maybe I'll re-install it for just this purpose...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 20:36 | Daniel M</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Lillian:<br><br>I wouldn't bet on it. There are several methods to use greasemonkey scripts with IE, but none of them is 100% compatible. I tried Trixie, but it didn't work. There's also "Greasemonkey for IE" and Turnabout Advanced, but the I haven't figured out how to use the former and the website of the latter seems to be down.<br><br>Daniel M:<br><br>That would be the next logical step and I already have an idea how to implement it. But before I make the script more complicated, I want to figure out why it doesn't work correctly in Chrome.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 20:48 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I found the problem with Chrome (and Opera), I had to change the loops to have it work.

If you change it to "var highlight_mark = 1;", Mark's posts will be highlighted green, everyone else's yellow. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 23:40 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Right now the script is still limited in that when you load the forum main page and the topics get highlighted, as soon as you navigate away from that page, you loose the highlighting. So the best procedure for now is: 1. Open main page, topics get highlighted. 2. Open each highlighted topic in a new tab (Ctrl+Click in most browsers). 3. Read each topic in its seperate thread and close it. 4. Refresh main page and repeat.<br><br>Eventually, I'll modify the script to remember which topics where read when, so it can maintain the highlighting as long as you didn't click on the topic. But I think this will do for now. ^^</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 23:50 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Since the "last updated" timestamp only changes when something really was changed, the last highlight will "linger" until it is replaced with the new one. I could make it so that it disappears if the main page is loaded with no changes, but that would mean that if you load the page twice by accident you lose all the highlighted posts. I think I'll wait for the thread-by-thread-update to address this issue.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 23:57 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't suppose it's possible to have the script open any post links in a new tab/window?  It's easy to forget to Ctrl-click.

Did I fail to install something or do it in the wrong order.&gt;&gt;<br><br>No, that's how it works right now due to how the script works, as I described above, and the reason for changing one of the scripts to open each thread in a new tab/window.<br><br>There really isn't a right order for installing the scripts. You either have them or don't. I'll reorganize these scripts soon and then update the instructions properly.<br><br>So far, there are four scripts in this thread:<br><br>1. <br><br>The first script highlights the topics that have changed since the last visit on the forum main page:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforster.net_highlight_new_posts.user.js">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforster.net_highlight_new_posts.user.js</a><br><br>Since it is time based, once you get the highlights, the "last visit" date is set to the current time", that's why the highlights aren't there when you go back - the "last visit" has changed and there weren't new posts in the meantime. (That's also why you get a highlight if you posted yourself), because it notices your post as new since your last visit to the main page). <br><br>2. <br><br>The second script (chronologically the third in this thread) highlights the new posts inside of threads:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_highlight_unread_posts.user.js">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_highlight_unread_posts.user.js</a><br><br>This highlighting does not go away if you navigate from the page and return, because it is dependent on the "last changed" date/time saved by the first script. So the highlights will stay until the first script finds new changes and updates the timestamps.<br><br>These are the scripts that do the highlighting. The other two scripts are variations of my older "go to the last page of threads" script. You don't need them both, only install one.In fact you don't even have to install one of them, if you want to navigate manually from the first page of each thread.<br><br>3.<br><br>One alternative is the script that get's you to the last page of a thread and scrolls down to the bottom (if there are no new posts, otherwise the second script scrolls you to the first new post):<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_lastpage_scrolldown_newtab.user.js">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_lastpage_scrolldown_newtab.user.js</a><br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_forum_sho.user.js">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_forum_sho.user.js</a><br><br>4.<br><br>This is the same as the third script, but additionally it opens each thread in a new tab/window, so you don't have to hold down ctrl or shift (depends on your browser) while clicking to do so manually:</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2010 at 14:08 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for that clarification, Andreas.

Thanks for this great extension.<br>2. My "back" key no longer works: is this connected in some way? It's quite a high price to pay.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2010 at 12:00 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will:<br><br>Ah, I see. You back key is probably fine. The problem is you installed the version of the "go to last page" script that opens threads in new tabs (script 4 in my previous post). The new tab has no previous page, so the back button doesn't do anything. You can do two things:<br><br>1. Uninstall script 4 and install script 3 which doesn't open threads in new tabs. Then you are still in the same tab and can use the back button to go back to the forum main page. But when go back you'll lose the highlighting of new threads for reasons explained above.<br><br>2. You can try to get used to having threads open in new tabs. Instead of the back key, you'll have to press Ctrl+W (or Cmd+W on Macs, I guess, not sure) to close the tab with the thread and get back to the tab with the forum main page. In this case you'll keep the highlighted threads until you manually reload the main page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2010 at 12:34 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just noticed I screwed up pasting the links in my script summary post. <br><br>This is script 3 (opens threads in same tab):<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_forum_sho.user.js">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_forum_sho.user.js</a><br><br>This is script 4 (opens threads in new tabs):<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_lastpage_scrolldown_newtab.user.js">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/greasemonkey/markforsternet_lastpage_scrolldown_newtab.user.js</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2010 at 12:57 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas,<br><br>In the words of the sage, "Doh".<br><br>Silly me.
