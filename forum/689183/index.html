Unless you're checking in every day and glancing at each new thread, it's impossible to keep up. I'm fascinated by Autofocus and its users, would like to get more involved in the community. Sadly I don't have time to keep track of so many uncategorised discussions.<br><br>Is the time right to move this discussion to a forum with categories? It might be useful to have separate areas to discuss for example: digital, paper, the "philosophy" of autofocus, autofocus at home, autofocus at work, beginner's questions, advanced hacks and tips, and so on. Having these areas would make it easier to keep track of discussions -- and I think would also spark a wider variety of interesting discussions too.<br><br>It would also mean that newcomers to the system and site could find information they were looking for more easily. Currently I'm not sure this forum is the right place to send somebody who's just thinking about Autofocus.<br><br>I'd be happy to do some of the technical work setting up a different forum, if you (and particularly Mark) think it would be helpful. For a very easy and powerful solution, a Ning group might work well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 10:18 | David Barnes</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In my experience that is often not very helpful.  People have to decide where to post and readers have to guess where they want to read.  On most sites which have multiple sections people tend to do most of their posting in one thread, regardless of what the subject is.<br><br>I think it is too much overhead for not much payback.  Beside, this might be a solution looking for a problem.  I'm finding it not that difficult to just read the most recent posts from the threads sorted to the top by date.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 10:27 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David:<br><br>I've thought about using one of the many forums which are available. But I actually agree with Mike. I know it's very tempting to want everything neatly categorised so no one ever has to repeat anything - but the reality is that's not how things work in the real world.<br><br>The real point of this forum is that people can come on it and ask questions and get virtually immediate answers. That's what most people do anyway, even on Forums with categories.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 10:44 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi all,<br><br>I'm having the same problems as David, maybe even worse, as I can only look at the forum on weekdays, so today am trying to catch up with everything from the weekend.<br><br>Having said that, I also agree with Mark that categorizing the forums will be a nightmare to follow.<br><br>I'm waiting for Mark's other suggestion to become possible - for the forum to be available by RSS. That will really make my life so much easier. Also, let's be honest, AF is new at the moment, I'm guessing the use of the forum will calm down at some point ... from my point of view, I'm hoping that isn't too far away, but I guess from Mark's pov, it would be better later, as that shows that people are taking AF on.<br><br>So no answers from me, but if an RSS feed (or some sort of email notification) does become possible, count me in.<br><br>Donna</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 11:29 | Donna Taylor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for your comments. If the forum exists primarily to provide answers to questions then it makes sense to just have one big discussion. I was thinking more of a community of autofocus users, with the opportunity to talk about things that are not simply quick Q &amp; As. It would make it easier to have very nichey discussions going on, e.g. AF for learning a new skill -- something I'd like to discuss, but is likely not to move fast enough to stay on the front page here, and would thus slip off the radar.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 12:12 | David Barnes</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>What is a Ning group, please?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 13:04 | Giulia B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's a more complex kind of discussion community, where you can discuss different topics, share photos, send personal messages to other members, keep a blog, and so on.  Here's an example: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://aecnetwork.ning.com/">http://aecnetwork.ning.com/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 13:46 | David Barnes</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I completely agree that it's very hard to keep up with everything, so I don't even attempt to, but would like to. It's also difficult to decide where to post or find anything without combing through massive amounts of material. I don't know what the solution is, but I would like to see some different arrangement.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 14:10 | Balfour</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>What makes the forum especially hard to read is that a lot of threads keep changing their topic in the course of the discussion. If you remember having read something, but you don't know in which thread, and it's buried inside a thread with a completely different subject line, it's very difficult to find. The search function doesn't help much with that.<br><br>In many forums, a thread will then be split by the moderator and the new subject made its own thread under a new subject line. Mark, maybe you could adopt this practice? <br>OTOH, this will increase the number of threads even more, of course.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 14:28 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Having the most recent posts at top instead of bottom would save me a bit of time.<br><br>I think that there are a number of natural categories. Sometimes, I'd choose to just look in a specific category; sometimes at the more general discussion. On forums I run, there's never been a tendency for everyone to post in one option - I think that's a question of category choices that are meaningful to posters. It is certainly a problem I've seen elsewhere.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 14:28 | Dm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>We have a Yahoo group <a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AutoFocusTM">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AutoFocusTM</a> that can serve many of the purposes you are mentioning.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 14:37 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Balfour:<br><br>The answer to "where to post" is to start a new thread using the Create New Post button at the bottom of the main Forum page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2009 at 16:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Let's be quite clear what we are talking about here. There are 7,836 posts on this forum altogether.

He is currently spending some time with his daughter so it will probably be a couple of weeks.<br><br>As you know the posts are in order of last post date so will always be in noguchi format (albeit without the envelopes!) which as you say is good for a running conversation.

If you try and keep up with the latest posts, you will be spending a lot of time re-reading the start of the thread and scrolling to the end to find the one new post.<br><br>What I am doing is I am reading threads from the second page.  I get to read the entire discussion, without having to check the same thread several times.  The information is just as valuable when it is two or three weeks old as when it has been just posted.  There tend to be only a few (somewhere between one and ten) threads per last posting time.  Generally, I feel like I am not getting any further behind.  It suits me!<br><br>The only disadvantage is that I know if I reply to a thread I am resurrecting an old thread, which means I don't contribute very often.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2009 at 15:04 | Penny</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ChristineB, ahh happy memories.
