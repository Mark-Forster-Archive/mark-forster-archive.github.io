Might not work.  Probably needs tweaking.<br><br>Picture a whiteboard with post-it notes, which represents something like an AF4 list.  A typical board fits 10 down, 14 across.  Imagine there's two and a half columns of post-its, then a marker-drawn horizontal line (closed list) , then 4 more columns of post-its (open list).  The team <br>	- looks at the board, <br>	- examines items one by one, and <br>	- each person may select something to work on by grabbing the post-it.  <br>	- When everybody has something, flag the last scanned spot.<br><br>When anybody finishes or gets stuck, they <br>	- return to the board, <br>	- If there's more to do, repost the card at the list-end, note the new status<br>	- if there's no more to do, post the card in a Done area <br>	- post new cards if new ideas come up, and then <br>	- pick a new item starting from the flag.<br><br>If, per rules AF rules,  tasks need to be dismissed, <br>	- move these to a dismissal area where the team or manager can review them.<br>	- Draw a new line for a new closed list.<br>	- Wrap the list around the board when you hit the right wall.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 October 2010 at 18:54 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I should explain why.  I find AF provides a very important balance between big and small, important and urgent.  I would like to bring that quality to team work.  Kanban seems to be good for ensuring what you start gets finished, but it doesn't provide much guidance in choosing what to start, and also tends to narrow the scope of discussion to project items.<br><br>Above I posted mechanics, but I think a discussion of balancing team effort might be more pertinent.  Perhaps completely different approaches are better for this context.<br><br>Ideas?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 October 2010 at 16:45 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree that some system is needed when working in groups. I personally find that using a Kanban is the best way to approach it. It's kinda similar to what you propose in that : you use intuition, you see big and small things but since there is a "done" column, people have a sense of completion.<br><br>AF is great if you are mindful about the fact that your list will never end. The closed lists parts will but the list itself will not. It's good for a "chipping at the mountain" kind of thinking but you can't expect people to adhere to it...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2010 at 0:33 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Erik - but there can be subtle sense of completion with AF. Where you draw the line separating the closed and open lists, I write the date it was created. The faster I get the open list to close, the better I feel about my progress of work.<br><br>Obviously, if you cheat yourself and just "bring the file out" for every closed list task just to get to completion, it won't work, and that dang intuition-thing will shout it out to you. But that wouldn't work for any system.<br><br>That date trick is from Mark I believe, and it is a subtle progress marker in itself, I find.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2010 at 2:14 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+AJPM+<br><br>I agree with Erik, a Kanban system is I think the best way to do that, Alan.  I think a simple picture will say it all:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/whiteboards-050.jpg">http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/whiteboards-050.jpg</a><br><br>God bless.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2010 at 3:16 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As I said, Kanban is fine for advancing tasks to completion. We can use this for that. <br><br>My search is a way to be sure a proper variety of things are chosen to fill the board.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2010 at 3:54 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The problem I have with Kanban (including the system described in Erik Lorraine's video, which had me thinking about it for two weeks!) is the sheer volume of tasks that are always on my list.   I've been doing DWM since its inception and typically have 600 to 800 individual active items on my task list at any given time:  individual emails, voicemails, projects, project-related tasks, recurring tasks, occasional-maintenance tasks, one-off tasks, one-off ideas to explore, etc.  <br><br>I really liked Erik's kanban based ideas and tried to find a way to merge them with my workload but in the end I gave up.  <br><br>For a team-based system, I think the teams I am on would have the same issue.  There's just too much volume of tasks with complex interrelationships.   We are also geographically dispersed, and screen-based Kanban systems I've seen don't have enough resolution to display 100+ tasks in a useful way.<br><br>(I'd love your feedback or comments on this!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 October 2010 at 8:00 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>That was certainly my reaction too when I looked at Kanban. I couldn't see how it could deal with the sheer volume of tasks that most individuals have, let alone teams.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 October 2010 at 10:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim I agree screen resolution is limited. We use a whiteboard. <br> <br>We are attempting to follow a Kanban at work.  To clarify some confusion:<br>1. It isn't tasks that go on the team board, but rather standardized items of a particular variety. In our case the items are expected software behaviours. "saving files" <br>The tasks are defined by a process represented by columns, applied to each work item. For example, "investigate. Define. Code. Test. Document. Ship"<br>so obviously team kanban doesn't cover everything, just the core functions of the team.<br>2.  Kanban insists on limiting work in progress. A suggested ideal is that # of cards = 2x # of people. So hundreds won't come up. <br><br>  Aside from this, there is a backlog of inactive items, which Kanban offers no advice on choosing, and everyone has his own way of tracking everything that doesn't fit the primary function.<br><br>I still seek a system that helps with those 2 issues.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 October 2010 at 12:55 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting, it's the first time I heard about the number of tasks being a problem to use what I describe. I can see where it would be unfeasible if you have even 100 open things in your backlog!!!<br><br>Remember though that what I proposed is not a way to follow which specific tasks you have done but rather to balance the "type" of tasks you have done in a day. The tasks themselves go on project lists or checklists... So what I move around is blocs of time that are general descriptions of generic tasks. If I go for a run one day just to try it out, I take my "exercise with bicycle" bloc and use that one instead of writing a new "one time" sticker ;)<br><br>p.s: By the way, I laugh every time I see it but my name is Lorrain (without the e).<br>I laugh because I have had teachers all my life getting my name wrong.<br>ex: Eric, Erick, Éric... Lorin, Laurin, Lorain, etc...<br>For that exact reason, I won't bite if you use it any way you feel appropriate ;)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 October 2010 at 13:15 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Erik - Sorry for misspelling your name.  My own gets butchered all the time, so I sympathize.  I've been called Saraphin, Sarapan, Surfing Man (I kid you not!), Syrup, Sarap, and Seraph (for those who just can't bring themselves to call a single individual by a plural name).  :-)<br><br>And yes, your system focused on what ***kinds*** of tasks to do.   That was pretty interesting, but my schedule is typically too chopped up by meetings and such, that if I am going to get my work done, I have to sacrifice some balance.   Some of it just happens naturally -- a morning full of meetings naturally leads me to seek quiet time for the afternoon. <br><br>So, it wasn't so much the task-type-balancing that appealed to me -- it was more the visual "pull" of the kanban system.  <br><br><br>Alan - Thanks for the clarification, that makes a lot of sense.   <br><br>It's helpful to see that you are forced to focus on max number of tasks = 2x number of participants.   The hard limit would naturally force you to choose.  That's one of the things I like about DWM -- it forces you to limit your total tasks or else they will all start falling over the waterfall.   <br><br>It's also helpful to see that "everyone has his own way of tracking everything that doesn't fit the primary function".<br><br><br>This is all very interesting because I'm trying a new twist on DWM right now where I have two "hot lists" that contain only my top, primary work and my top, primary personal tasks.   These are the tasks that I "know" will make the most difference, the ones that keep pushing on me, the ones I keep resisting, the ones my manager (and at home, my wife) are always asking me about.    I give each of them its own DWM list, and spend most of the day, outside of meetings, focusing on the Work Hotlist, and most of the evening and weekend, outside of family time, focusing on the Personal Hotlist.   I have then been blocking out meetings with myself for handling maintenance and miscellaneous, each with its own DWM list.  <br><br>At first I started panicking because I couldn't see what was on the lists I wasn't currently looking at.  But I stopped panicking when I remembered that I had already blocked out time on my calendar to deal with those things.   Each list has several time blocks per week on my calendar, so they won't get dropped.   <br><br>This is the same way I handled all my regular meetings with other people, such as my biweekly 1:1 with my manager -- I just kept a DWM list of all the stuff I needed to discuss with him, and went through each item on the list when we met -- or at least whatever "stood out".   If something never stood out, then it dropped off the list, and we never discussed it -- which was fine.<br><br>This way of handling ongoing meetings worked so well, I decided to set up meetings with myself to do the same thing.   I've only been doing it a few days and I like it so far -- but then again, I like every new approach for the first few days.  :-)    Time will tell if this actually works for me or not.<br><br>But back to the main thread -- maybe I could work each of my hotlists in a Kanban way -- they are small enough that it might work.  Interesting...   Know any Kanban plugins for Microsoft tasks?   :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 October 2010 at 0:53 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
