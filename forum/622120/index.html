However make sure that is kept for true date specific tasks and not tasks that maybe just have a deadline. By all means put deadlines on a calendar if you need to but include those tasks in your AF - you may well find they are done long before the deadline.  Similarly follow up tasks can easily be kept in AF - you will see the reminder regularly as you scan through the lists.  Don't forget to add a "check scheduke" task though!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 January 2009 at 23:00 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Why not just draw a vertical line across the page?

Tesco's Finest Executive Note Book comes in A4 or A5, cheap at £4.00 or £2.50, and the page has margins left and right for ticks or date markings.  The left hand margin would make a great tick box for left handed AF'ers as this was mentioned earlier.

I thought that I had more important things to think about, such as actually getting things done!  But, losing my A4 notebook has given me the opportunity to use an A5 bound notebook.  This is not a "designer" notebook with a fancy name - it was free with a magazine and works fine.  It has about 20 lines to a page but I haven't actually counted them.  I haven't found it better to have more lines to a page.  I do actually need a smaller closed list to have any hope of getting things done.  If I see too many things on a list I immediately become overwhelmed and that just induces inertia.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2009 at 22:55 | Sandy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm just using an old Quad-ruled (graph paper) notebook, 9-3/4" x 7-1/2", about 40 lines per page.

You could draw a line down the middle of the page; on the left, the calendar; on the right the task list. I don't have a ton of appointments but i do block out time for specific tasks. I just have not tended to look at my to-do list while blocking time--I've kept that in my head as to what I needed to do with that time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 February 2009 at 13:42 | Inkstain</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Ranier<br>My system is set up quite similarly to yours.  To handle notes, I created a tab at the back end of my binder and filled it with blank pages. It is here that I jot down my various thoughts to review when I deem appropriate.  I devised this method for precisely the same reason.  I, too, wanted to capture my ideas yet didn't want to pollute my diary section pages.  Make sure that the tab is plenty big and made of strong stock!  Some days can be quite prolific with ideas!

They cost a great deal less and seem to be well made.  Only problem is only 19 lines / page and it does seem to be a bit of a disadvantage.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2009 at 16:43 | Mary</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In my continuing struggle to make AF work at work, I use an A5 Atoma notebook with reorderable pages. What I noticed just recently, is that it's actually nice that you can add additional notes for the tasks into a separate section at the end of the notebook. Since pages are replaceable, you don't have to worry about running out of pages in either section (which also solves all problems with 'filling up' your notebook and having to transfer your tasks). That way, you have a place to write down everything that would end up on scraps of paper otherwise (I don't feel like setting up a 'project' folder for every little note). It also gives you a bit of the additional annotation possibilities you'd have with a digital setup. <br><br>Since my notebook only has 25 lines per page, I use 2-page spreads as AF 'pages'. I'm not sure this works quite as well as the original page-as-closed-list method. Unfortunately, Atoma notebooks are sold here in Germany only in one 'flavor' than I'm not too excited about, and only by Manufactum, who are notoriously expensive.<br><br>For my home lists, I use a Moleskine Pocket Volant which not only has even fewer lines per page (22), but which is so small that I often need two lines for a task, so two-page spreads are mandatory there as well. Honestly, the Volant doesn't feel quite right as an AF notebook, but it fits nicely with the Moleskine Pocket Weekly Planner.<br><br>Mark, what exactly is a "standard A4 refill pad"? I noticed your notepad in the video, but we don't seem to have those here.

It opens flat so I can hold it in my hand if necessary.  I get them from Sam's Club (U.S.) at 10 for about $5.00 so the price can't be beat.  I got a fine point ball point pen that breaks in half so it just fits into the rings and stays with the pad.  I have three plastic paperclips (I don't like metal because they tear paper) one for first active page, one for current page, one for last page.  I get 15 lines per page and I found that doubling it by putting two items on a space (one near the top line and another near the bottom) I get 30 per page which does work better for me.

It's an A5 and the pages can be reordered, refilled, etc.  Mine has a a hard cover and folds all the way around to lay flat.

I switched to the tiny notebook thinking I would use it for mobility, but I never did.  I put all my errands and grocery lists into remember the milk because I always have my phone with me so that made more sense to put those tasks there.  If I think of something to add to AF while I am away from my notebook, I just whip out my phone and email the task to myself.  I can then write it down when I get back to my desk.
