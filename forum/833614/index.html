Unfortunately, unless I have them on a shortened list (like AF condensed), I resist them, even though they're the most important things.  And even with AF condensed, I am encountering resistance.<br><br>I have even found that, although I have time to work on my personal goals while at work, I will find structured procrastination working against me in that I am finding ingenious ways to take on more work on the job rather than work on my own stuff.  :-(<br><br>Scheduling a block of time doesn't seem to work for me either, although I have been staying late after work occasionally to write - but there's plenty of time to do so during the day.  I just do that because I know I won't feel like doing it once I get home.<br><br>Part of the problem seems to be that something like writing a novel is linear to me (non-fiction isn't so linear).  Otherwise, I would put lots of items relating to the writing on the AF list and kind of "stack the list" like I have with other projects I wanted to move faster on in the past.  But with "THE BOOK", I have only a couple of items on a list of &gt;100 items.  I know some writers (Diana Gabaldon comes to mind), write in a disjointed way (ie. hopping around among scenes) - but I think it shows in the final product.  I used to have a job writing 50+ page business plans and offerings of memorandum, and could hop around in the writing.  I would usually felt a bit of resistance to starting but was able to carry through fine, get something - anything - down and then expand / edit the heck out of it.<br><br>Mark, I've been looking through your past blog posts to try to find an answer for this, but haven't been successful - it's like a combination of DIT and AF, with DIT covering a small portion of the day.   Any insights from when you were trying out a combination method?<br><br>Exercise is kind of the same way for me.  And I just dismissed one of my exercise items this morning.  It's just so frustrating!!<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2009 at 17:37 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline:<br><br>With things like writing books my own method has always been the fixed time method. However only the starting time is fixed. My aim is to write "something" each day. Some days that something will be 5 minutes (or less) but most days it will be a lot more. But as long as I've done something, I've succeeded in my daily goal.<br><br>This works for other things like exercise, where the thought of doing a long session may be too much for one's willpower, but once one's got started often one doesn't want to stop.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2009 at 22:59 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline, I have been spending a lot of time reading about and working on goals lately. One of the things I've found is that when you spend time working on the motivation for what you're doing, the actual work isn't much of a chore. For example, when I ask myself WHY I want to accomplish a certain goal (and I actually write this underneath my electronic goal on my AF list), it helps enormously. Maybe instead of or in addition to adding your writing or exercise task, write numerous reasons why you want to achieve the goal on your list or add the task, "Review reasons to achieve" or something of that nature. Or if you have a particularly rebellious nature, you could do as Mark has advised and write Do Not Write Today.<br><br>One of the things that helped me was from Alan Lakein's book that Mike had recommended: compare your lifetime and 5-year goals to the goals you'd have if you had 6 months to live. I found it helped me to distill what is really important to me. After that, I wrote down potential steps to take now and added them to my AF list and found I couldn't wait to do them! Lakein recommends scheduling them but that doesn't work for me. Instead I added them to the list and gave them a deadline of a week from now. I then found I had no resistance to doing them now so I can get them done well ahead of time.<br><br>I just started reading Unleash the Warrior Within. Have you read it? It seems like it would be up your alley. I really like it so far! He is talking about the decision we make to achieve our goals. I know you've done BFL as I have. When I did that, it wasn't even a possibility for me NOT to complete it. I had made the decision. Have you really made the choice to write your novel? Or are there fears or uncertainties holding you back? Are you trying to write a perfect novel right out of the chute? Perhaps just a brainstorming task would meet less resistance.<br><br>I had tried to write a book many, many times and failed. But once I really decided and had a firm deadline with backup (the weekend retreat I was addressing was expecting the books!), I couldn't help but write. Have you set a deadline for completing it? When you know that you know that you know that you're going to write that novel, we'll have to pry you off the keyboard. LOL</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 3:57 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel,<br><br>I totally agree about getting at the core of the motivation in order to make accomplishing goals so much easier.  Like I've posted before, getting at the "why" that really worked for me with respect to money was a huge breakthrough with respect to earning and saving more money.  It made it fun, non-sacrificing and pleasurable.  And opportunities presented themselves somewhat magically. :-)  It took me about 5 years to accumulate more than some people do in a lifetime all for the 'why' of freedom.<br><br>That's what I'm trying to do with the writing now.  Since I went through Lakein's book about 15 years ago and in every other goal-oriented book or program I've gone through since, one thing has always emerged - and that's to write novels.  It was something I used to do for fun when I was a kid and up through until I had my first child (21 years ago!)  My focus was always on "be a bestselling author" - now I'm taking it down a lot of notches, and my new goal is "learn how to write good fiction."  By making my new goal "writing a shitty first draft", I'm just trying to take the fear out of it for me right now.  <br><br>Too funny - I think I was the one that recommended "Unleash the Warrior Within" to you a couple of months ago!   I did Harv Eker's "Warrior Camp" about 10 years ago (the second year it was held, I think) - and, although a book is a poor substitute for an experiential learning like the camp, I think it's extremely motivating to read those kinds of books just to get over ourselves.  Your philosophy becomes one of "I'm afraid - I have to stop" to "I'm afraid - ok, let's do it."  And after awhile of doing that, there's no fear anymore.  <br><br>I've got my goal set for a shitty first draft to be done by July 31.  Needless to say, I'm quite far behind on this goal - having said that, I've read of people doing NANOWRIMO and pulling off 500,000 words in a month!  It's like the 4 minute mile, when people saw Roger Bannister do it, all of a sudden many other people broke that record shortly after.  <br><br>After some reflection today, I think I've got the right m.o. figured out and I'll see how it works this week.  I'm going to give myself 5 sections to write every day of about 200-400 words and use natural transitions in my day to write.  That will be my mini will-do list<br><br>This post up to now was 430 words and took me exactly 5 minutes (timed!) to write.  And I wasn't writing as fast as I can - so it is possible to still meet the deadline!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 5:44 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline:<br><br>Another motivational technique which I've written about before is after you've written out your list "I want to write this book because..." write another list "I don't want to write this book because..." Once you've identified the negative reasons which are pulling you away from your goal, you can do something about them.<br><br>When writing books I've also found it very motivating to keep track of the average number of words a day that I need to write in order to meet the deadline.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 9:50 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline<br>I'm not sure if this suggestion helps you any, but I often discovered that the cause of my resistance was simply that certain aspects of book simply needed backburner status to percolate and mature (It might be because I'm a whole systems thinker rather than a linear thinker.)  I won't go into my whole routine about setting up my mind towards creativity, but in reference to writing, I'd choose to free associate on the typewriter about something not "maturing".  Sometimes the act of simply free associating helps to speed up the backburner process.  Sometimes it might take a few days of this, other times it seems to fall into your lap.  Believe me, your subconscious is in the background working on your goals with you!  What does it hurt to offer it some assistance?  Also, what helps is to take some time to simply read the works of authors your admire or play music in the background that ignites your confidence and passionate spirit.  There are many ways to invite and aid your subconscious.....after all, that's the birthplace of most of your creative expression.  I'd do a ritual before I went to sleep (bedtime or mid-day nap) and FLOOD my brain with whatever I could think of that might contribute, music, reading, writing, sketching.....many times when I woke up, I knew I had it and then would go on a blissful jag of getting it expressed (usually art or writing but it also worked for music composition, gymnastics and dance as well.)  Bottom line, you're offering your subconscious a grab bag of stuff to work with to do it's magic!  To be clear, you're not PUSHING it....rather you're feeding it....does that make sense to you?  (These things are difficult to articulate sometimes.....<br>Sometimes I'd pretend that I was a journalist doing a review of my (undone) book or a teacher giving a lesson plan to the class., or a writer assigned to to do the publisher's review....then write something wearing that different hat....just a trick to give yourself a different perspective<br>I hope this helps.<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 12:32 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>I'm not sure if this would happen to you......but sometimes upon waking, I'd knife the painting, break apart the sculpture, shred the book.....because I woke up with a LOUD and SURE path of something entirely different!!!  It was full-formed and begging to be made 3-D...It was COMPULSORY and EXCITING!!!!  There was no way I couldn't do it unless someone put me in a coma!  LOL! <br> A huge factor of creative expression is openness and willingness....  Sometimes I was contracted to finish the "less inspired" work, but I'd still take the time out to do the authentic one!  After all, that's why we're like this....we LIVE for these times.  It's like we're communing with the divine in us and (hopefully) our expressing that will ignite that same divinity in others as well!  <br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 13:05 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline, you gave me a great LOL to start my day. You probably DID recommend Unleash the Warrior to me. :-) Reading it couldn't have come at a better time for me. I had a possible stalker this week and it brought up a lot of old stuff. I really needed to confront the fear and I feel SO much better! <br><br>I have read the NANOWRIMO stuff and I think it's a great idea. Have you read "How to Write a Book in 28 Days?" or something like that. It's an Ebook and I found it enormously helpful. Now whenever I feel uncertain about a writing project, I use the techniques suggested and boom! I'm off and running. I also agree with Mark about having a daily writing goal based on the deadline. That helped me a bunch, too, but I was so motivated it was hard to get me to STOP writing. I usually wrote until 2 or 3 a.m. and honestly wasn't exhausted as a result. <br><br>I think your new goal is very appropriate. Don't worry about the deadline. Focus on today. You can do today. Let us know how it goes. We're cheering you on!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 15:16 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I also agree with Mark about having a daily writing goal based on the deadline. &gt;&gt;<br><br>That wasn't quite what I meant (though you can certainly do it that way). If you keep track of the number of words per day needed in order to meet the deadline, it helps to keep you motivated because it decreases if you do more than that number and increases if you do less. So your goal becomes to decrease the average number.<br><br>Example: <br><br>10 days to go and 10,000 words to write.<br>Average number of words needed: 1,000 per day<br><br>Today I write 2,000 words<br>9 days to go and 8,000 words to write<br>Average number of words needed pd: 889<br><br>I have decreased the number of words needed per day from 1,000 to 889. This is motivating because I can see the task get easier and easier the more I write.<br><br>The next day I don't write anything<br>8 days to go and 8,000 words to write<br>Average number of words needed pd: 1,000<br><br>Again this is motivating because I can immediately see the effect of my neglect on the target. I've lost my gains from the previous day. It's not a disaster but I can see that I need to pick my ideas up.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 15:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Excellent point!

Since I hate doing accounts or I might not have the mental capacity to do them on that particular day, chip away at it on previous days is to my benefit....or intentionally do it all, if I want to open up that time.  I also chose Friday because I like to close shop as early as possible so I chose what I hate worst of all for Friday's round-up category. LOL!
