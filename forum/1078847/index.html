You're almost as good a writer as I am. Sorry, but I feel compelled to use this now: ;-) I really appreciate your honesty and I've seen a major shift in mood on this board as a result. <br><br>Mike, I think you're right. I DO care about my housekeeping and my kids and my homeschooling, but I have some habits that get in the way of that sometimes. TM systems can get me on track for a time, but it's when I have a major shift in thinking that long-term change occurs. Then I find myself really caring. But it's tough to produce more caring or a mind shift at will. Often I think that's what I'm looking for--something that will make me care more or will completely change the way I think about what's already important to me if that makes sense. So like a rat on an intermittent ratio of reinforcement I keep bar pressing with my mouse trying to get that reward. <br><br>Jacqueline, as usual you made me laugh. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 April 2010 at 0:08 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel<br>Again, you compel me to write....<br>Please don't be so hard on yourself.  From what I can surmise from your posts, you are hard-wired to be intelligent, curious and creative.  Ergo, you're hard-wired to avoid the pain of boredom much like one would avoid sticking their hand into a fire!  Bus, alas, being right-brained doesn't give us a free pass from the mundane scut.  That's where the cheap mind tricks come into play...We need to find ways to launch ourselves into a stance of willingness to bear out the boredom to get the result.  As I see it, I'm not going to curse my genetic inclinations nor futilely hope to change my hard-wiring.  I use my mind tricks to merely circumvent the avoidance patterns.  For me anyway, it's coping not a cure.  I wouldn't want to do too much fiddling with learning how to embrace a boring process to get a result.  That might screw up the wiring that supports the curiousity, problem-solving skills and creative bents I thoroughly enjoy.

A bit of planning coupled with some good habits goes a long way toward meeting your aims.  Some of the principles and procedures offered in Mark's DIT book helped me tremenously to better hone my own system.  Little and Often for the projects queque and daily implementation of his Current Initiative does wonders when it's governed by his principle of Commitment versus Interest.  It keeps my weekly plan tight and effective and FLEXIBLE yet RELIABLE.  I'd recommend that book to anybody who wants to get the biggest bang for the buck in terms of effort and effectiveness. I like to timebox my important endeavors and I rely heavily on the use of my timer to get past resistance tendencies whether physical or mental.

A couple grandparents who used Yinglish. Pick up phrases and words here and there. Had some Austro-Hungarian, German speaking great-grandparents. They spoke dialect and words and phrases trickled down.<br><br>Lived in Austria and Germany for a while and picked up some Salzburgerisch / Bayerisch. Since those dialects stem from Middle High German as does Yiddish and I studied MHG while there and a bit of Yiddish theater in the early 20th century Austro-Hungarian Empire, my memory and explicit understanding of the fragments culled during my early childhood were strengthened.<br><br>Don't live in an area where Yiddish is used. But many words are part of English now, and frankly some which are not as common express things I just can't otherwise in English.<br><br>Many Yiddish words literally embody what they speak.<br><br>"Verklempt". When that second syllable is spoken, you feel a bit verklempt (I usually find myself using spelling closer to German). <br><br>It is hard to say "kvell" without feeling that beaming sense of "pride" (not the best word to use), probably more like joy for someone else.<br><br>In any case, the "Chosen" part of my family were atheists and anti-Zionists. Some of my aunts and cousins have converted to Orthodoxy. I think the question surrounding who is and who isn't Jewish is frankly insane. I don't identify as "Jewish" and I would have to convert to convince most Jews that I were. I would have passed in Nazi Germany as a good Aryan, but not if my family history were known. In fact, I recently received part of a payment delivered to my family for property confiscated during the Nazi era.<br><br>All that aside, I was probably the only kid hanging tobacco who knew what Lavern and Shirley were on about in the opening of the show with "Schlemiel! Schlimazel!".

How are you? How's that bookcase coming along? ;-)<br><br>I mentioned that I agreed with the don't change yourself article somewhat. Taken to its extreme, it's too psychobabble for me. What I agreed with was the notion that if our motivation for change is really disgust with ourselves, we're less likely to succeed than if we adopt my 4yo's notion of "I'm just learning." <br><br>Example. If you want to lose weight, I would argue that mentally haranguing oneself about being a lazy fat pig that no one could love isn't the best path. Rather, asking oneself what new behaviors you want to learn that support healthy eating and exercise is a better one. In addition, changes that are attempted because of an underlying belief that we're not acceptable as is are harder to sustain. In the spirit of the Inner Game of Tennis, you're not playing a game you can't win when it's about growing vs. changing who you are. Of course, you can certainly end up being a much different person as a result of growth, but it's all about the nature of the goal.<br><br>Clearly there are some "bad" habits and behaviors. But "changing ourselves" becomes less stressful when we don't think of ourselves as "bad." That's my take on it. OTOH, if recognizing your inherent badness is what really motivates, I certainly won't argue against it. Maybe it's a matter of your natural inclination. If tend to think I'm "bad" too often, so changing myself this way doesn't typically work for me. If you're an arrogant person, a little dose of poor self-esteem or other-centeredness may do the trick.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 April 2010 at 14:44 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey Mel,<br><br>In the spirit of not changing I decided to let the book case fall apart ;-)<br><br>I agree with positive vs. negative impetus for change .. but on the whole, I think change is not only good, but invertible.  IOW, we either change in a way that helps us or hinders us .. but we all change.<br><br>My icon for the nearly perfect human being (my lovely wife) even works on change ... thus her attempting the "century bike ride".  It is instructive that when it became clear to her that she'd never make 100 miles she just "re-calibrated" and set her sights on 50 miles.  Not giving up change or her goal, just adjusting to one that could be achieved.  And when she made her 50 she was dancing around like a nut case.  It was 100% successful in her eyes, even though the goal had changed.  That is the way to do things, IMO.  Make it so you can't possibly fail.  Of course, it takes some honesty to not fudge things so that they become meaningless.  She did not settle for 5 miles, after all, but rather the doable but very difficult 50 miles.  So she could be well proud of herself.  She had many opportunities to just quit.  There were portions of the trail still covered in ice.  There were parts that were deep mud.  And it had rained the first three days of the week so it was very tempting to blow the whole thing off for a day at the movies!<br><br>I think that change is part of nature and recognizing that and choosing in what way we change is part of being human.  As my buddy Heraclitus said: "You can't step into the same river twice."  He had a point, and how wonderful ... or else how boring life would be.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 April 2010 at 21:19 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, LOL about the bookcase. Yes, your sweet Lisa is a wonderful example of positive change. Let's be honest and say that we're probably splitting hairs differentiating between "change" and "growth." What I think is critically important is that we do focus on progress most of the time. Sure, there's a time and a place for a swift kick in the rear. But most often we need to say, "Hooray! I met a tough goal!" rather than, ""Why do I always fall short of the mark?" <br><br>I wonder if Lisa has been rubbing off on you because you seem to have mellowed er changed lately. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 April 2010 at 21:47 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum, if you're still reading, how's your sleep thing going?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 April 2010 at 22:46 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;Example.

I just said that a "friend's wife planned to bike 100 miles, changed her goal...yadda yadda" as the discussion was on success, failure, and goals. You almost would have enjoyed the class.
