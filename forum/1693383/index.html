I used the superfocus model, but instead of using C2 for unfinished or urgent items, I used it for anything that involved direct contact with another human being:  returning a phone call; making a phone call; emailing someone about something; meeting with someone, following up with someone.  These kinds of actions seemed to be the ones that were most time sensitive.  C1 was the usual stuff -- filing, writing (mostly), planning, laundry, tidying up, taking out the garbage, errands, anything else that didn't require contact with another person.  I suppose if your work involved more "contact" type stuff than anythign else, you could reverse this and keep the non-contact stuff on C2.  <br><br>This idea came from a post I saw a while ago, I probably can't find it now, but about dividing work into "contact" type work and "non-contact" type work, and devoting a certain amount of time each day to "contact" type work.  <br><br>I think keeping up with the contact type work and giving it a higher priority is a very good practice in general.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2012 at 2:05 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Paul - I suppose this idea could be expanded to use C2 for whatever you want to emphasize in your particular environment.  <br><br>For example, if you are an independent contractor who tends to spend too much time on administrivia, you could use C2 for "billable work".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2012 at 2:58 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, that would be exactly true. As I think about it, not everybody would have the same balance of "contact" vs. "non-contact" work as I have.  At the same time, for me it seemed to have lifted the burden of having a pressing phonecall to return somewhere in C1.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2012 at 4:34 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; What would the effect be of abolishing the dismissal rule in AF1?&gt;&gt;<br><br>This is what I've been doing! For months now.<br><br>Though, I've been feeling bad about it and have occasionally "gotten a folder out" just to avoid dismissing a page. In other words, I have not actually removed the rule or cheated it but have rendered it inoperable either by staying at the end of the list (where all the hot items are) or by taking trivial actions to pass through the older pages. I don't think I've dismissed a single page since restarting AF around August!<br><br>This entire past year, I have tried to take to heart the notion that dismissal is a crucial part of balancing the system, but it has always remained for me a source of resistance and of forcing me to do things at the wrong time—and then I have too many things Unfinished.<br><br>Telling me to ignore the dismissal rule ... this is telling me to do what I'm going to do anyway, without playing games or feeling bad about it!<br><br>I find this comes back to my favorite "dashboard" concept I've mentioned before: show me what's true, rather than prescribing the steps to take. If I see a clear display showing me, e.g. what's in progress, what's same-day-urgent, what's a great idea but hasn't been started yet ... I will know what I need to do just by looking at it. The trouble is, how to construct such a display without unacceptable overhead? Eliminating dismissal is a big step in this direction for AF. Along with the start-on-yesterday's-page rule, AF is becoming a nice dashboard.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2012 at 7:11 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I quite like the idea of "optional dismissal" i.e when a page is ready to be dismissed as per the normal AF1 rules, you now have three "options" instead:<br><br>1. Dismiss the page<br>2. Use your "get out of jail free" card to save the page from dismissal for now.<br>3. Rewrite any tasks you don't want to lose at the end of the list, freeing up the rest of the page for dismissal<br><br>Sometimes I find a task on a page that I would like to keep around, but would also not like to do there and then just to save it.<br><br>I'm a fan of doing tasks that you feel "inspired" to do rather than "forced" to do and the dismissal rule as it stands is too much "forcing" for me.<br><br>I'm of the view that anything you genuinely want to get done will feel "inspired" to you when the time is right for it to get done - and that momentum towards inspiration usually comes from successfully completing other "inspired" tasks. It's like building up speed before the long jump.<br><br>So, for me, being able to keep necessary tasks hanging around on ready-to-be-dismissed pages, until that inspiration comes, is a good idea.<br><br>I also think there comes a time when it is obvious that particular tasks are no longer relevant to your life and you just get tired of looking at them, so that is when a page can be safely dismissed with the full backing of your intuition.<br><br>If you are starting each day using the modified AF1 rule of beginning at yesterday's entry point then it becomes less of a handicap to have lots of old pages hanging around because they won't cause a drag on the currently-important stuff.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2012 at 8:22 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Paul <br>I like the idea.

New idea: if the problem (as I discuss in the other thread) takes a couple weeks to manifest, maybe a good rule can be found that doesn't dominate the system. Why worry every page about what's only a problem after two weeks?<br><br>Proposed rule: mark for review every page more than 7 days old ( OR: when you add a page, mark for review a page seven days back.)<br>Scan all pages, but marked pages call for the following choices on tasks:<br>Delete, move off-list rewrite, ignore, but not Do. I think having a page where the thought is what-to-kill will be a healthy emphasis, to maintain list control.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2012 at 13:49 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Combining ideas from previous thread, here's my plan:<br><br>a. Any time you think of a task, write it last page.<br>b. Any time you pick a task to work on, write it last page, do it, and cross-out the original. <br>(I'm keeping these visually distinct.)<br>c. When a task is finished, flag it, meaning Seraphim's "Finished - what's next?"<br>d. Each day, mark for review any page more than N days old. (7?)<br><br>1. Scan through the last two pages. Do any  tasks, according to rule b. Repeat until nothing stands out.<br>2. Scan marked pages: Do none.  Instead, pick some to delete, move off-list, or rewrite.<br>3. Scan remaining pages.

You've always had the choice of entering projects as a whole or as individual tasks, or both. Having a separate project list is also an option (either composed ad hoc or maintained continually). For any really complicated project you would need to refer to the project documentation in any case.<br><br>So if you find that dealing with individual tasks is messy and without feeling then enter tasks at the project leval and use a separate project sheet. That is standard AF/SF practice.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2012 at 20:57 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Frank:<br><br>&lt;&lt;I also think there comes a time when it is obvious that particular tasks are no longer relevant to your life and you just get tired of looking at them, so that is when a page can be safely dismissed with the full backing of your intuition.&gt;&gt;<br><br>This shows a completely diferent understanding of what dismissal is all about. This also explains why many people are so reluctant to dismiss.<br><br>I quite happily dismiss pages that contain tasks that I know I still have to do. To me, dismiss does not equal delete, but more something like "put on hold for now".  I'm quite confident that these tasks will resurface in due time. To ensure this, I have a recurrent task in my system called "Review dismissed items". When I feel it's time, I go through the dismissed (highlighted) items again and either:<br><br>- definitively delete them,<br>- re-enter them,<br>- move them to my tickler to re-activate them on a specific date.<br><br>In the meantime, I don't have to read through all these pending items over and over again. In fact, you could consider dismissal as simply a change of frequency for checking out the items: from at each pass of the list (i.e. every one or two days) to at review time only (every one or two weeks). Psychologically, this is a big relief!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2012 at 14:26 | Marc (from Brussels)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think you're right, Marc, in that dismissal is one of the hardest things for people to get their heads around. I know it took me a long time to be willing to dismiss things. Now I do so quite gleefully! <br><br>I don't keep a "review dismissed" as a recurring task - rather, it gets entered every time I dismiss a page (which, even though I've gotten past my mental block against it, is still only about once a week, depending on the number of crises I'm dealing with at any given time - more crises = more dismissals).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2012 at 16:22 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I believe it's the word "dismissed" that's at fault.

Any politician or public figure will tell you that "what you say" is far less important that "how you say it". You should know that, yourself, considering the multitude of interviews that you've been in. The choice of vocabulary sets the tone of a message, much like background music sets the tone in a movie scene.<br><br>With that said, I must admit that I hadn't thought about the impact the term "dismiss" was having on me. Now that it's been brought to focus, I think I agree. I fear dismissal because, despite the rules about review, dismissal seems so... enduring. No, it seems permanent. (See? Two words that mean the same thing but invoke completely different emotions.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2012 at 17:20 | jFenter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting. I understand the rules of AF1 about dismissal but I have to also agree that the word "dismissed" brings up a sense of finality which makes you feel, perhaps only at a subliminal level, that there is something serious happening when you do it.<br><br>I note that with GTD's Someday/Maybe list (when I followed GTD), I could throw stuff into it all day long without a care in the world knowing that I would see it again at the next weekly review, but I feel much more (subliminally) reluctant with "dismissing" items in AF1.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2012 at 18:03 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Dismissed" in the context of AF1 just means "sent away from the list because not needed now". <br>Those dismissed tasks can be brought back to active status any time you want to.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2012 at 18:06 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"The soldiers were dismissed after the parade was over"<br><br>"I dismissed the thought from my mind for the time being"<br><br>"The staff can be dismissed for the holiday as soon as their work is done"<br><br>"Class dismissed!"<br><br>"I dismissed the task from the active list for later review"<br><br>No sense of finality in any of those - and they are all perfectly normal uses of the word "dismiss".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2012 at 18:22 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So odd. <br><br>The inability to stick to AF 1, or do work/chores, etc., is due to semantics.

Therefore I have decided we need a new name. Since it's my system, what better name than my own?<br><br>So from now on we will use "forstering" instead of "dismissal". To "forster" should replace all the non-permanent senses of "dismiss".

And the fact that over three years of people objecting to the term I've never been persuaded to change it shows that I am pretty happy with it.<br><br>Remember that "dismissal" has two objectives:<br><br>1) to increase gradually the pressure to get a particular task done<br><br>2) to give a chance to consider why a task has failed to get done and to do something about it.<br><br>Remember that according to the rules you are not supposed to re-instate a task without its being changed. This change may be a rewriting or rewording, or a change in circumstances, or a reconsideration of the importance of the task itself in conjunction with other tasks and its place in one's overall vision.<br><br>"Dismissal" is not just a matter of taking a task out of the system and putting it back a few days or weeks later. There is a finality about it, and that finality is intentional.<br><br>So I'm sticking with "dismiss".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2012 at 10:31 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>BKK:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Mark, respectfully, when you quoted Alan, you didn't put the little smiley face that he included at the end of his statement. &gt;&gt;<br><br>So in one breath you berate me for using a word with negative connotations to describe the process, and in the next give the process negative connotations yourself?  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2012 at 10:38 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I guess that some people might think of Dismissal like you're "disbanding" something.  <br><br>Instead, I like to think of Dismissal as if I were telling the task:  "Right now, I don't want you loitering around and slowing up my standing-out process for the more important tasks at-hand.

This is what gets at the possibly "temporary" nature of dismissal for me. Last week I had a Friday deadline on one thing.

It's actually good in a weaker fashion like that of Romans 7: <br>"For I don't understand what I am doing. For I do not do what I want - instead, I do what I hate. But if I do what I don't want, I agree that the law is good." -Romans 7:15, 16<br><br>Even so, I should dismiss things and thus be more able to do the things I want done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2012 at 12:38 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I do think we unconsciously react to the choice of the word dismissal differently than we would if a different word were used, e.g., suspend.  But dismissal does apply some pressure that might be needed whereas if I was to suspend an item, I might not feel any pressure at all to consider it now.<br><br>Some of Mark's examples actually make the case for our feeling that dismissal might be somewhat final, especially "class dismissed".  Sure, it might be scheduled to reconvene the next day, but the completed class is done.  The next one will be different.  Same topics, same course, same teacher, same students, but different lesson.   The class is dismissed, but the course will continue tomorrow.<br><br>I like Marc's way of looking at it:  &lt;In fact, you could consider dismissal as simply a change of frequency for checking out the items: from at each pass of the list (i.e. every one or two days) to at review time only (every one or two weeks). Psychologically, this is a big relief! &gt;  But he still uses the word dismissal, so the word itself still carries on in our subconscious.<br><br>This is really just another way that we all are different.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2012 at 12:52 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>We might all be different, but it is still a mechanism to further a process (and a good at that) - whichever way you want to look at it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2012 at 13:10 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Defer?<br><br>(adjourn, postpone, withhold...)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2012 at 14:00 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(Re-evaluate?...)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2012 at 14:19 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If you are using a paper system dismissed items are still on the list and highlighted.

By not doing an item, I have decided I may do it later, highlighting it or not the result is the same to me.  My pages are a huge mix of longer term items including some things that may actually be deemed a project, along with things like call Ted.  So for me it is easier to make the decision at the individual task/item level.<br><br>The more I contemplate TM systems, the more I realize I want to be thinking about my business and less about following rules.  The change I have made so far seems to move things forward.  Since dismissal caused me hesitancy with it removed, there are only two options do it or don't do it.
