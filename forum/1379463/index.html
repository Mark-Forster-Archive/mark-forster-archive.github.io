I'm still  not sure who my favorite is: It keeps rotating between John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin.<br><br>Now, I can't stop laughing as I remember 'Close Order Swanning About', 'The Bishop', 'The Cheese Shop', 'The Lumberjack Song', 'The Dead Parrot Sketch', 'The Larch', stop it, I can't stop thinking about it, I have to get back to work......stop....Brain, please turn off.<br><br>A couple of years ago, my wife and I went to New York to see Eric Idle's Spamalot.

I haven't yet dismissed a page for non-action; I HAVE dismissed/deleted/calendared items that I wasn't ready to work on at the moment.  There are a number of tasks that under DWM would have gotten worked on, then pushed onto page W and sat there for a week before I worked on them again, and progressed very slowly (the perfect example is transcribing a number of interviews, which is work that I am *extremely* resistant to but that has to get done if I ever want to get my PhD.  I plowed through one in just 2 days at the end of last week due to its presence in column 2).<br><br>To a certain extent, this system changes what ends up staying on the list.

I've always said that the dated dismissal of DWM was a strong motivating factor for me because I'm a really good starter but not such a great finisher but... it seems to be turning out that column two is even more powerful that dates!  The mechanics of WORKING the list don't quite sing to me in the way that the DWM mechanics did but I think it'll come.

If you read back through these forums you'll find lots of discussion back and forth between people who struggle to get through their lists once a day (like you) and people who cycle through very rapidly (me and - apparently - Mark). I'm not kidding when I say I am the embodiment of little and often... I routinely work on things in 10 or 15 minute chunks.  I don't set out to do this, it's just the rhythm that works for me.  I ramp up to things pretty quickly and honestly, I think my subconscious does a lot of the "how should I word this argument" processing when I'm not paying attention (or I have a flash of inspiration when I'm in the middle of something else, which then gets put on my list as a task to be filed away appropriately later).  I don't actually *time* my work - but when I start feeling like I'd rather check facebook than work on writing the abstract that's due on the first of March, it's time to advance it to column 2 of the next page and move on to the next thing because my efficiency is about to TANK.  There are definitely times when I will sit down and work on something for hours at one sitting... But one of the greatest gifts that Mark's systems have given me is the acceptance that there's nothing WRONG with NOT working that way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 2:04 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; but when I start feeling like I'd rather check facebook than work on writing the abstract that's due on the first of March, it's time to advance it to column 2 of the next page and move on to the next thing because my efficiency is about to TANK.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Haha, well put. <br><br>Also DEFINITELY agree with you about how the your mind seems to process things when you take a break from them...<br><br>Tried speeding things up today, so far so good, will keep it up.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 4:20 | OhNiners</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Tijl:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I notice that you have quite a few dismissed tasks awaiting review.
