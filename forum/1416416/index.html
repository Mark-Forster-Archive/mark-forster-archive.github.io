As per the rules, I had to work all of Column 2 (C2) and work or dismiss Column 1 (C1).  No problem.  Everything was doable but I didn't clear the page before I left for work.  The following page was the last page and hadC1 and C2 tasks (the C2 tasks overflowing from the previous page).<br><br>Ok.  So today I go back to work and open up the notebook to the active page.  Both columns still full with open and lined through tasks.  As I look at the list I think "I need to process my email urgently".  So Where do I put "Email" as an urgent task?<br><br>If I put it on the next page my assumption is that I cannot work on it until I have cleared the previous page (which I am quite happy working but it ain't going to clear quickly enough for me to satisfy my gut feel that I really should be processing my email.)<br><br>In the end, I put email on the next page C2 and processed my in box.  Actions that came up as "urgent" during the email scan, I added into column 2 of that page.  "Normal" tasks generated by email processing were added to C1 of the last active page.<br><br>Once I had processed these items I went back to my unfinished page and full page.<br><br>Any ideas about how I "should" have done it?  <br><br>Thanks</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2011 at 21:45 | Spike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Spike:<br><br>What's happening here is that you are overusing column 2, either because you are entering too many "urgent" tasks at one time or because you are not phrasing your tasks so that you can finish them quickly. It could of course be both!<br><br>If you keep finding that Column 2 fills up, then you need to look at how you are using it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2011 at 21:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Excellent.  Thanks for the advice, Mark.<br><br>I'll work on it!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2011 at 22:17 | Spike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Okay I'm just gonna write something that popped in my mind although it most probably is very stupid (I am not even trying SF yet), but im taking the risk :<br><br>If someone is using a small, pocket-sized notebook (21 lines), using left page as column 1 and right page as column 2, could one.... divide the right page in 2 columns?<br><br>This would yield twice as many lines for right page/column 2 vs the number of lines of left page/column 1 (42 vs 21 in my current pocket notebook).<br>This could present the advantage (?) of giving more lines for "urgent" and "unfinished" tasks in the same page while also forcing one to enter column 2 tasks as concisely as possible.<br><br>Of course a ratio of 2 to 1 is probably too much, but one could divide only the bottom half (or more, or less) of the right page to "customize" the number of lines of "column 2". Maybe it could be a good thing for people whose situation give them too many "urgent" tasks. Maybe (probably) it's beyong stupid and even breaks the system  - I don't know.<br><br>I realize this takes away the pedagogical virtue of "If you keep finding that Column 2 fills up, then you need to look at how you are using it", and also, less lines for column 1 (21 vs the 31 Mark is using) affects the dynamic of the system in a way I havent even thought about  (maybe it makes the "column 2 filling up" problem worse, maybe it makes it less likely to happen)....<br><br>There, from now on I promise I wont suggest any "tweak" to any system until I have actually used it for some time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2011 at 22:38 | Daouda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Daouda - I am using a small notebook as you describe.  Sometimes, I admit, I've been squeezing 1 or 2 extra items into the top margin of Column 2.  This is probably having some detrimental effect.<br><br>Hmm, let me think through it.  Is there any fundamental reason why the number of items in each Column needs to be identical?  What effect would it have if you doubled the number of items in Column 2, as you propose?<br><br>Well, let's take it to an extreme:  let's say I block out all but 5 lines in Column 1 (so I have space in Column 1 for only 5 tasks), and leave 25 lines in Column 2.   I suppose this would have the effect that Column 2 would be able to "carry" more items forward with each page-turn.  And because it COULD carry more, it WOULD carry more.  This would mean I'd be drawn to start more items (because there's room in Column 2) but would not compelled to finish them as quickly.  I'd quickly get Column 2 Constipation, with too many items in Column 2 that I MUST move forward or delete forever, and not enough new items in Column 1 to keep it lively and interesting.    I'd basically be presented with mostly the same items in Column 2 all the time.   Also, since there's not enough room for new items on each page, I'd keep adding new pages to the end (5 tasks at a time) -- I would expect this would lead to me constantly chasing the end of my list, plodding through all those same items in Column 2 all the time.   I'd probably hit a wall of resistance after a while, and just quit.<br><br>Let's try the opposite thought experiment.  What if I am allowed 25 items in Column 1, but only 5 items in Column 2?   Column 2 would fill up VERY quickly, forcing you to dismiss the Column 1 tasks next time around.  Lots of things would be forced to be dismissed before you really had any repeated exposure to them, so dismissal would lose its force.   (Dismissal is supposed to take effect after repeated exposure, so you've had plenty of chances to take action but never did.   If dismissal happens before that repeated exposure, then it becomes meaningless.)   You'd be forced to re-enter those dismissed items pretty quickly if you really want to do them -- but they'd face dismissal again very soon.   What a mess.<br><br>So, based on this thought experiment, I'd say an equal number of tasks on each page is a pretty good balance.  An extra one or two items in Column 2 probably wouldn't hurt things much, except for the fact that it would lead me to take the rules less seriously overall.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 2:07 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim, thanks for sharing your thoughts. Your virtual experiment actually convinced me to try blocking out one to three lines of the left page (C1) if I ever run into the "full C2" problem too often even after having "looked into how I am using it" seriously.<br>If i always block out the same number of lines systematically it then becomes a part of the rules for me, so in fact there is less risk doing this "would lead me to take the rules less seriously overall" compared to occasionaly cheating by "squeezing 1 or 2 extra items into the top margin of Column 2" like you are currently doing ! A lesser of two evils...<br>Also, those few empty lines at the bottom of C1 (leftpage) could be put to good use : some kind of stats about the task list, or some kind of reminder, a quote/tip from Mark, phone numbers/emails related to tasks on the page, a place for doodles, sketches, poetry, maps, recipes, movies (flip book), a parking spot for your car... The mind boggles with the endless amount of possible uses !</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 2:57 | Daouda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; a place for doodles, sketches, poetry, maps, recipes, movies (flip book) &gt;&gt;<br><br>I like the flip book idea!

If you put too much in Column 2 you will end up with a heap of stuff that must be done every time you turn a page. You might just as well forget about turning pages and have a list of must do's which you keep circulating through. <br><br>I wrote a system like that ten years ago in "Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 9:16 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>While Mark's system can be extremely bottlenecked in column 2, there's a "pychological" feedback loop (via teaching the user new habits) to reduce load on column 2. However, the arrival rate of urgent tasks is not usually controllable through that loop. If urgency is externally determined (as it usually is), I see only two sane ways to cope with urgency-induced column 2 overload:<br><br>(1) make it larger (more lines) or (2) track urgent tasks outside of the system.<br><br>Mark: If the user adds lines to column 2 in response to a "chronic urgency crisis",  in the long run there should be as about as many lines as before for unfinished tasks, so the only increase in things to do on every page turn is _new_  urgent tasks. Doing those preferentially is probably unavoidable anyway. (Personally, I'm back to option (2) for my system, it is more robust that way.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 9:41 | Marcus</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If your job is mostly urgent stuff, I would track those outside the system.  Alternate between the system and the urgent stuff. Just an idea.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 12:49 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It seems to me if your work is 80% urgent items you should just put them in column 1. Hear me out. I started to write something about this yesterday but I couldn't figure out the solution. With so many urgent items, you have to realize that you don't have time for a bunch of non urgent work at the same time. Maybe you can start ONE big job at a time that is not urgent, but you do little and often in column 2. (Oh, I just got that idea from Mark in another thread.) Otherwise, let the urgent items make you turn the page quickly. If you end up dismissing a bunch of stuff in column 1 because you can't take on any of them, let them get dismissed. They will still be available when you have a chance to take on another miscellaneous non "urgent" (to the customer) task.<br><br>Put another way, don't force yourself to do those non time critical column 1 items especially if you feel like there is something on another page you need to get to.  This is advice for myself because I've been stuck on one page and just bringing urgent items from other pages onto my current column 2.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2011 at 14:30 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Could this 'urgent' items issue be settled by using an alternative system of the AF2 method (or even AF4) as column one (new and recurring items) with column 2 being used exclusively for unfinshed items?
