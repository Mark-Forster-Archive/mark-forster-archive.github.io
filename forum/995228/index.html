Publish the instructions (let's say as a 5 page ebook) with a suggested minimum donation (e.g. $5) I think this is really important, many people won't donate if they don't have an amount.<br>2.  Ask people to only spread the instructions via the website or if they summarize in a blog post to also include a link for more details and donations.<br>3.  Finally (and here's the key to making this a success) tell everyone that you will work on a full book (self or publisher published) if you get a certain number of minimum donations(say 1000 or 5000 or whatever.)  This can act as kind of a publisher's advance by giving you upfront cash, while also showing you that enough people are interested to justify the time and effort put in to a real book.  This also makes all the regulars feel empowered since they can go out and tweet about it to encourage people to read the instructions (and hopefully donate) in order to get a potential book out of it.<br><br>Anyway just some thoughts.  Hopefully you can derive something of value here.  And thanks again to you Mark for the systems and also to all the regulars for the great discussions!<br><br>Chris</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 17:43 | ChrisK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Regarding "there are only about 20-30 regulars" -- Are you basing that on who comments or statistics from your site?

However I would also be hesitant to push the e-book thing for a couple of reasons.  First, releasing systems free does not create nearly the expectation that someone who pays may expect.  I'm not talking strictly about forum members, but potential new members and the public at large.  We all see you creating new things, tinkering with them and understand the amount of time that goes into it-someone who stumbles upon the ebook and buys it will not have that background.  As you've conceded before, one time management system doesn't do it for everyone and AF certainly didn't work for me.  <br>Second, although you test these systems, I think you'd agree that they become better when done open source so others can troubleshoot them and find problems.  <br>Maybe the happy medium is a brief period where it is free to download or a donate button as others have mentioned.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 18:11 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'd pay and I'm a lurker.<br>Be sure to set up for credit cards, not just paypal</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 18:34 | gghays</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Regarding expectations - I have the Zen-to-done ebook.  It's pretty fullsome - I edited it into Word becuase I wanted to print it out and read it and make notes and it comes to over 35 pages of text. I was very happy with what I got for my money. I think it is all about managing people's expectations.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 18:37 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think it's challenging for some people to pay for "value received" from something such as an eBook versus the "size" of that same thing (e.g. page count, chapters, etc.).  A 5-page eBook may not be worth $5, if you can buy a 50-page eBook from someone else for the same price.  But the value received from a 5-page Mark Forster eBook could easily offer over $500 in value to the reader, if taken to heart.<br><br>In reality, I expect most productivity eBooks available today fall short of their authors' revenue expectations, and just create another mess to be managed by their own productivity system. :-)<br><br>Charging for something that used to be free can also polarize Mark's fan base.  I understand that DIT was not free, but AF is, and Mark would likely take a hit in popularity from the casual visitor.<br><br>Better to sod it and enjoy a stress-free retirement...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 19:30 | Brian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Long time lurker and more than willing to pay.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 20:10 | Jake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark - You could open a thread inviting all 'lurkers' to send a post letting you know they're there, and asking how often they read the forum? Or would that overwhelm the system (as I expect there are lots)?  It would be an interesting exercise, whether or not you used the information to decide about charging.   For my part, I'd be more than willing to give a donation and/or buy the DIT2 book if you write one.

Once it is set up it can sell forever via a link.<br><br>I decided to make all of my content free as the time management niche is hard to monetize unless you do the full blown GTD route with an organization, DVDs, training and a series of books etc and really promote it.  Someone on here told me simplicity does not sell well and they are right.  When you tell people to be a GTD black belt takes two years versus using my simple system on a legal pad or  AF or DIT, you loose lots of people who like the "cache" of GTD and the complexities of it.<br><br>That said, I would gladly pay or donate up to $10 for the new instructions as to me it is not the length of the content but the quality of the ideas that matter.

Mark, should I hold off until the revised copy is published?  I'm an oldish bird.  I prefer books to electronic reading.  I don't need to boot up a book!  Plus, I love the accompanying tactile and even olfactory sensations!  lol!

Ask people for their e-mail and country, give them an opportunity to subscribe to the newsletter and don't just offer a donation button, but integrate it within the process from putting the download in your shopping basket till downloading the book. I can imagine that you would prefill the donation with 5 EUR and give people the opportunity to set it to zero, or to a bigger amount.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2010 at 10:16 | Evelyne</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Implemented right, it sounds like Evelyne has a great idea.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2010 at 16:48 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, I agree.

BTW, did anyone happen to notice the price for "How to Make Your Dreams Come True" on AmazonUS? $165 new and $69 used. I ordered it from AmazonUK for 20usd, now I see the price has gone up. Not bad for a time management book. I'm guessing it's out of print in the US. Good Luck with DIT2! Looks like you have a good following.
