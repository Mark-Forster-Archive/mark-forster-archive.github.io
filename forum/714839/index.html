I used AF for about 2 months and noticed that while I was definitely more productive overall, I wasn't getting the most important items done.  I decided to divide my AF list into 4 sections for the 4 key areas of my life:  Work, Education, Toastmasters (I am in a leadership role and have lots of associated tasks) and Home/Others.  I tried dividing my days/week into zones during which I would work on my various AF lists.  That wasn't very effective as I found that I resisted this level of structure.  I am a real rebel at heart!<br><br>After seeing so many mentions of Do It Tomorrow on this list, I bought that book and read it.  I was very excited about the possibilities and decided to try that system.  That was about a week ago.  Here are my pros and cons for DIT:<br><br>PROS OF DIT:<br><br>- I LOVE the "current initiative" concept!  I had 3 different ones this week and all were quite effective.  The first was to get rid of email and paper backlogs and that was accomplished in two days.  Then I had two projects which I was able to get started after much procrastination in the past - yay!<br>- I LOVE the idea of actioning email, calls and paperwork one day at a time and only dealing with same-day items if they are REALLY urgent.  That is working well for me!<br>- It forces me to look at what's most important.  Since my life doesn't really lend itself well  to the concept of "one day's work," I have to decide what to do each day (this is also a CON - see below). I go through my AF lists (now just 3, as I moved Toastmasters in with Home/Other since it has slowed down).<br><br>CONS OF DIT:<br><br>- Since my life doesn't have distinct "days of work," the DIT lists are more arbitrary and I have difficulty determining how much I can realistically do in a single day.  Many of my tasks have indeterminate time frames (i.e. I may think it will take 2 hours and it takes 4 or 5).  <br>- Hard to complete full list each day.<br>- Feels too rigid.  I miss the flexibility of AF.<br><br>So now I want to COMBINE AF and DIT... Here's what I'm thinking... I will continue to action email, paperwork and calls using DIT guidelines.  I will limit my "tomorrow" list to 3-5 items max (not sure which) and work AF the rest of the time.  My "tomorrow" list will consist of ONLY what I feel truly has to be done that day.  <br><br>The problem is how do I use my 3 AF lists.  Do I set work hours, education hours (I am not in a distinct program but am learning skills to pursue a new career - I only work part-time), and home/other hours?  Do I combine the lists again and just work one AF list during AF times?  If I do that, I may put a letter in the margin to note in which "region" the task falls (work, education, home/other).  Then I may find that the items "stand out" depending upon time of day, etc., or at least I will be more aware of which types of tasks I'm doing.  I can even keep a tally to increase awareness...<br><br>I LOVE Mark's work and find great points in both AF and DIT.  I know that many find AF is perfect for them, but that wasn't so for me.  I guess my rational mind overpowers my intuition such that things don't stand out when they should?  Or maybe I just want to work on the home/other tasks more than the work and education tasks (that was what happened...).  In any event, I feel I need a hybrid system.  I have been waiting with baited breath for Mark to come back with one, but since that hasn't happened yet, I am asking for feedback from this group.  I know we have so many creative minds here and that you will be helpful!

I am using a paper-based AF system and for things that must be actioned today, I have these as tasks in my Outlook 2007 next to my calendar.  This really does work well and is in line with Mark's original instructions -- if it must be done today, then just do it!  If you want reminders of a sequence of important tasks that are due -- and I do this even though they are still in AF -- then place these in your calendar for regular review.  I also block off time in my calendar for dedicated project work if I feel that I need to keep up with certain due-date driven projects.  But I still use AF for my discretionary time and it works beautifully!<br><br>Mark, what do you think?<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 20:13 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi David<br><br>It sounds like your systems are working a lot better for you these days - hope that means you'll be able to cut those horrendous working hours a bit :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 23:19 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Christine B,<br><br>Yes, AF is working very well these days -- and I have you and several others -- including the grandmaster himself -- Mark -- for my great productivity and focus on what is really important.

Having said that I don't want to put anyone of doing something which works for them.<br><br>Anyway let's just look at what the main feature of each system is:<br><br>1) With DIT the essential idea is that one is on top of one's work all the time. The critical concept is "one day's work". That means that you should be up-to-date with your work on all current projects, i.e. that everything that can be done on those projects has been done or is in the course of being done. The idea of having a separate "master list" of tasks from which you make a selection is totally alien to DIT. In DIT that "master list" is called a "backlog" and requires to be dealt with as such in order to eliminate it. If you can't keep up with the current work and start falling behind, then DIT forces you to examine your commitments critically with a view to pruning them until you can keep up.<br><br>2) With AF the emphasis is completely different. The idea in AF is that you pour everything into the system and let the system itself sift it. The system is very finely adjusted in order to keep the conscious rational part of one's mind and the unconcious more intutive parts of one's mind in balance. The idea is that the system will enable your mind to come to better decisions about the use of your time than your rational mind working on its own will.<br><br>Most people's problems with AF seem to stem from the rational mind panicking about deadlines and priorities. Once one learns to calm the rational mind and trust the system most of these problems seem to disappear.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 April 2009 at 10:47 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>I hope you had a wonderful visit with your daughter!
