Each item must have a space at the left.<br>• Close the list with a line and add today's date on the line.<br><br>Step # 1: Prioritize<br>• You can add new items into the list anytime, but all new items must have a space at the left.<br>• For this step, label each new item as follows:<br>    - If the item is OBLIGATORY, i.e. you have to accomplish regularly to be successful (exercise, work, prayer, etc.), then label with an "O" at the space provided.<br>    - If the item is something you hate doing, something you SCORN, but you have to do, or things that need a lot of time and effort, (chores, maintenance, etc.), then label with an "S" at the space.<br>    - If the item is something that makes you unique, something that you can CONTRIBUTE to humanity and the world (learn to play a musical instrument or other art form, volunteer in a charity event, go out with friends and family, etc.), then label with a "C" at the space provided.<br>    - For every item left (i.e. EVERYTHING ELSE), label with an "E".<br><br>Step #2: Organize<br>• From the start of the list, go through those items that are labeled with "O" only.<br>• If any one of those "O" items are ready to be done, then do it. Now. No excuses.<br> - You must in fact revolve your whole day around the "O" items.  That is what is meant by "organize": organize your day so that you will NOT fail in doing the "O" items.  Do them first thing in the day; place them in your smartphone's alarm/calendar so you won't forget to do them; cancel other appointments so you can do them. Do whatever it takes!<br>• If you have done an "O" item, then cross out the item, rewrite it at the end of the list if needed, then go back to "Step #1: Prioritize".  If not, go to the next step.<br><br>Step #3: Streamline<br>• From the start of the list, go through the "S" items only.<br>• If any one of those "S" items are ready to be done, then plan first.<br>- The "S" items were marked by you for a reason: they are hard to do and will take the most of your time.  Therefore, your objective in doing them is not just to finish them, but to "streamline" them.  That is, determine the best way to do them in the least time and effort.<br>- This means that the Pomodoro technique and similar methods are probably the WORST ways to do these kinds of tasks.<br>- There are many ways to streamline "S" items.  For example, chain or bucket them with something else, eg. clean your dishes right after eating, or make your bed right after waking up, or do your laundry with yard work so that while the washing machine/dyer is doing its job, you are doing something else, or do all your errands at one trip.  And of course there is always music :)<br>- I also found a greater feeling of satisfaction in doing these kinds of tasks efficiently than with just doing them because I have to do them.<br>• If you have done an "S" item, then cross out the item, rewrite it at the end of the list if needed, then go back to "Step #1: Prioritize".  If not, go to the next step.<br><br>Step #4: Contribute<br>• From the start of the list, go through the "C" items only.<br>• If any one of those "C" items are ready to be done, then do them with abandon<br>- The "O" items may seem to be the most important items in the list, but actually it is the "C" items that are the most important.  The "C" items are the things that make you "you", what defines you, what makes you human and not an animal.  <br>- This is the philosophy of this whole system: to provide you with what you need (the "O" items) and get annoying things of life out of your way (the "S" items) so that you can be the best person that you can be (the "C" items).<br>• If you have done a "C" item, then cross out the item, rewrite it at the end of the list if needed, then go back to "Step #1: Prioritize".  If not, go to the next step.<br><br>Step #5: Economize<br>• The "E" items are the weird ones of the group.  You can do any of these things ANYTIME.<br>• They should be done sparingly, however.  That's why we are said to "economize" our time with them.<br>- There will be times that you will run out of will and energy to do any of the other items.  The "E" items are here to replenish you.<br>- However, they should be used sparingly, and more and more the "E" items should be exchanged for the "C" items to replenish yourself.<br>- You will also find "E" items that are some projects that you would like to do but did not have time to do before.  You might then want to reclassify those items.<br>• Go back to "Step #1: Prioritize".<br><br>Step #6: Review<br>• At the end of the day, draw a line and write the date of the next day.<br>• Dismiss all tasks from a week ago.<br>• Review your list for problem points.  These include<br>- Undone "O" items more than 2 days old.<br>- Dismissal of any other type of item aside from "E" items.<br>- Doing "E" items quite often during the day.<br>• From what you've reviewed, adjust.  Maybe you have made too many obligations? Maybe you are too loose with the scheduling of the "O" items? Maybe you are not enjoying the "C" items? Maybe you have not streamlined the "S" items enough? Maybe you need help?<br>• If needed to, reclassify some of the items by rewriting them.  You may also add items from your calendar for the next day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 December 2012 at 21:51 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting idea, I might give it a try.  Quick question, At several points (after step 2-4, actually) you suggest going back to step 1.  When you go back to step 1, do you include new items that have been added below the line?  Is there a way to handle new tasks that have to be done today?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2012 at 13:58 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+JMJ+<br><br>Yep, that's the plan: always go back to Prioritize after doing a task. This will give you time to consider each and every new task that comes along.<br><br>You then go through the "O" items, then, if none of the "O" items need to be done, through the "S" items, then, if still none of them need to be done, the "C" items.<br><br>The POSEC Method is based on the Maslow heirarchy of needs, in which the idea is that you have to take care of your immediate needs before you can do anything else. That is what I am trying to do also here.<br><br>How this system handles urgent items that come up during the day is to consider them as "O" items: you have to do them, so do them now, even if you don't write them on the list. Just do them, whatever it takes :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2012 at 16:00 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This looks like a powerful lens for assigning priorities and/or making things stand out. I like how it uses emotions to prioritize, and encourages you to spend time in Covey's Quadrant 2 -- Streamline. Associating contributing with uniqueness is neat. You don't get bonus points for spending three hours swearing at the accounts if an accountant volunteers to do it in one.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2012 at 16:46 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for posting this, nuntym.  It's a really neat way to think about your day.  Especially I think you are right to put the C before E.  I'm not planning to follow the method, as I'm taking Mark's recent input to renew my use of FV, but I think the ideas still have room to guide thinking.<br><br>Prioritize everything as Obligatory,Scorned (but important),Mission, Everything Else.<br>Organize obligatory stuff<br>Streamline scorned stuff<br>Maximize your mission stuff<br>Economize everything else<br>Review your work daily, weekly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 December 2012 at 0:30 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+JMJ+<br><br>Thanks for the inputs Paul, Cricket, and Alan :)<br><br>@Cricket: Yes, I find it very powerful in surveying my day.  It also guides me in how to go about with the tasks I have to do.  And actually I am finding more satisfaction in using it than with any of the AF variants before, as now I know I am actually doing the important stuff and not just trusting the system will carry me through the day.<br><br>And oh, thanks for pointing out that the feelings, or what could also be termed as passions, are major driving factors in the Prioritizing of the system.  I didn't even realize it until you pointed that out!<br><br>The system, however, does not specifically categorize items to any of Covey's Quadrant II (actually called Eisenhower Box).  I find that, if I would categorize the items in my list right now, the Quadrant II items are actually all over the place.<br><br>Let me illustrate with, let's say, the "Exercise" item.  Depending on what the person wants to accomplish with physical exercise and how he feels about it, it could be Prioritized into any of the classifications of the system.<br><br>If the person feels exercising is not that important for him, or if he feels he has too much in his plate right now, he might categorize the task as "E."<br><br>If the person is exercising because he wants to join, let's say, a triathlon event, he might Prioritize the item as "C".<br><br>If the person just wants to keep fit generally, and maybe he does not like exercising that much, he might categorize it as "S" and think of ways of incorporating it into his lifestyle, but not that much.  For example, he just might always use the stairs instead of the elevator during work.<br><br>But for me, I prioritize  "Exercise" as "O" because I had my back injured once at work, and I do not want it to happen again.<br><br>@Alan: POSMER, eh? Nice, but I want to stick as close to the original meaning of POSEC as possible.  Maybe I'll just call step #4 as "Commit" :)<br><br>Have a Happy and Productive New Year, everyone!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2013 at 0:57 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Allan, you wrote, "I'm taking Mark's recent input to renew my use of FV," ... could you elaborate on this or point me in the direction of where you found this input. Many thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2013 at 16:59 | Robbin Whittington</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sorry, Alan, about the misspelling of your name!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2013 at 17:00 | Robbin Whittington</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Streamlining is in Covey's Quadrant 2 -- important but not urgent. In one of his books (I think the first), he spends a good many pages on the concept. Do things before they are urgent. Also, invest the time now to make things easier in the future, especially routine things -- aka streamline them.<br><br>Yes, POSEC as you described it doesn't have the same classification, it encourages the same question: Is there anything I can do to make the Scorned stuff easier next time?<br><br>I notice it doesn't talk about streamlining the other sections. Streamlining may be most powerful with the scorned tasks, since reduces the time spent on them, but it's also valuable in most of the other categories. Obligatory tasks will take less time, scorned tasks will be less nasty, you'll be able to Contribute more in the same time (God may count your hours and effort, but the recipients count results), and you'll be more likely to do the things you Enjoy. For example, if you like skiing, streamlining would involve taking care of your gear, having a good way to attach the skis to your car, and bookmarking the website with trail conditions.<br><br>It's still a good way to tackle the list. FV didn't work for me because it didn't force me to consider priorities. Ancient projects that should have been kept on hold got attention, at the expense of the current ones. Doing a few passes only looking for Obligatory tasks, then a few with S, etc., would have helped.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2013 at 17:00 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+JMJ+<br><br>Ah, I gotcha on why you put streamlining as Quadrant II.<br><br>Of course "streamlining" is good to do with all the other classes of items.  But so also are "organizing", "committing". and "economizing".<br><br>One of the main strengths of the system is that it will suggest on what to focus on when doing the different items.  Obligatory tasks will certainly benefit from being more efficient in doing it (streamline), concentrating on doing it (commit), and doing only what is necessary (economize), but it is in focusing on making sure that these items are done (organize) that maximum benefits will most likely be achieved.<br><br>And so it is with scorned (streamline), contributory (commit), and extraneous (economize) items. <br><br>But that doesn't mean you can do any of those with the others.  <br><br>Thanks for the input again Cricket.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2013 at 19:06 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Robert, see here:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2039154">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2039154</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2013 at 19:20 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
