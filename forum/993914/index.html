I can't get my head around a goal that I will reach in a month (or even a week!) - but one in which what I do today will have a direct effect on, that I can almost measure tomorrow is significant for me.<br><br>One thing I have to work on right now is to get some exercise (and I am the queen of procrastination when it comes to exercise).  Any tips on this - or any methods of creating short terms goals I could use?  I'm a real couch potatoe who has recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (alothough not massively overweight - but I know it is a lifestyle thing), so it is a pretty important thing for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 14:03 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison:<br><br>It was a great system. The only trouble was that it got progressively harder to keep to!<br><br>My tip on exercise is to set yourself the goal of changing into your exercise kit every day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 14:31 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Two ways to go:<br>1) Be convinced that the SINGLE MOST important new habit in your life is exercise, and nothing in this world is going to keep you from your daily commitment.  As long as you keep your focus on this one thing, you will find a way to make it happen.<br><br>2) Remain unconvinced, but make your new exercise habit as easy as possible to keep: You only need to get your exercise clothes on every day.  You don't need to actually work.  Seriously.<br><br>Because this commitment is so easy and painless, you actually will develop the habit.  And you will find you actually do get some exercise done.  Your worst objections don't stop you, because you can convince yourself it won't be that bad and you are free to quit if it does.  <br><br>I read of a guy who trained to run a marathon following the maxim, "Every day I must run half as much as the previous day".  So if Monday he ran 2 miles, Tuesday he only had to run 1 mile.  If he did 1 on Tuesday he only had to do 1/2 on Wednesday.  What happened is that some days he did only that half.  Other days, he was energetic and did more than was required, and actually increased his mileage.  The habit grew out of enjoyment rather than pressure.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 14:46 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Over on my list I kind of comitted to posting the results of my weight loss project.  My goal is also a health one, but that is unmotaviting enough that I have made the enjoyment of my vacation in June to be the one I focus on.<br><br>My basic approach is to use the Atkins diet (low to almost zero carbs) with exercise and LOTS of water.  The Atkins has worked better than any other approach for me, but this time I notice that I'm not being strict enough so the metabolic changes that Atkins depends on are not taking hold.  I'm not sure why this is the case but it is right on the top of my mind ;-)<br><br>As to what is common to all specific programs: I think that Alan has it right (as usual).  Success depends on developing habits and making the program fun and easy.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 14:58 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison,<br><br>as you wrote - ... real couch potato ...<br><br>Make one small change in how you work at your PC or watch TV. Buy (or take it from the storage :) the fitness ball. There are different sizes, pick which is good for you. Then sit on the fitness ball instead of couch. You will get a lot of exercise just sitting on ball! Besides, it's very funny to find out on how many small ball activities can be made during watching/typing/surfing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 9:56 | veslavvv</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison,<br><br>Losing weight is one of the simplest things you can do. People like to complicate it. If you are serious, there are fool-proof ways to lose weight and maintain, especially if your goals are modest.<br><br>If you are genuinely serious and are willing to be honest and do a little work, let me know. I would be glad to put in the effort of writing something up if you provide more details about your situation, but frankly if you seriously doubt your commitment, I would rather not spend the time.<br><br>Good luck.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 15:09 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman - I am extremely committed on the weight loss - I have no choice as I have type 2 diabetes now so have to be thoughtful.  I have been given the opportunity to try and manage by diet and exercise alone so am very keen to do so as I don't want to go into mediation for it.<br><br>I managed to loose just under a stone before Xmas so feel I'm going in the right direction - but seem to have leveled off a lot since then.  Any contribution you can make to help would be very gratefully received.<br><br>I like pretty ordinary and home cooked food but have to watch my portion sizes as I can be quite greedy (I suppose like most people!).  For example if I am hungry I have to try and measure the amount of potatoes I eat otherwise I will use them to fill up.<br><br>I have cut out sugar where I can recognise it, and all 'white' goods so everything I have is wholemeal or brown (i.e. bread, pasta, rice). I have home made muesli for breakfast and either soup and bread or a sandwich for lunch. Dinner tends to be meat and lots of veg - or some other combination.  I have fruit between meals and if I want something else I'll have some fruit with some greek yoghurt and some seeds.<br><br>If you can offer advice I would welcome it - also I am keen to get onto the exercise bandwagon in some way if I can.  However the chance of my becoming a 'gym bunny' are rather small - I have neither the finances to join (they are really expensive at the moment - must be the new yeat!) and also I have to find the time and motivation.  I have a treadmill here at home in our dining room which seems to be gathering dust!  I think a sensible home based exercise program would be a good starting point.  I just have to do it!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 15:59 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"try and measure the amount of potatoes I eat".  FYI, sweet potatoes (yams) surprisingly are much more healthful than potatoes, especially for diabetics, due to high fiber and low glycemic index.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 16:37 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'd forgotten that - thanks for reminding - and it should offer a change!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 16:52 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison, The Daily Plate over at livestrong.com has a program just for diabetics.  I use their regular one on my blackberry (on the front screen so I can't ignore it) and it works wonderfully for me.  <br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.livestrong.com/diabetes-journal/">http://www.livestrong.com/diabetes-journal/</a><br><br>I don't have any issues with the exercise thing since I have a big, energetic dog who needs a walk/jog/bike/ski for at least an hour every day.  If I don't do it, he barks at me.  If you want to get out more and don't want to actually get a dog yourself, could you look into committing to your local SPCA or similar to walk their dogs?  Or meeting a friend for a walk?<br><br>I also have a Wii Fit which I really love using.  But in the past, prior to having the dog and the Wii, the best thing that worked for me was to exercise first thing in the morning (even if that meant getting up at 4 a.m. to do it).  Do it before you even think about doing anything else.  Sleep in your exercise clothes if you have to. Don't let yourself sit down and have that first cup of coffee until you're done.  It also leads to reducing the amount you eat every day naturally because you don't want to undo the benefits of the exercise you've put yourself through.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 18:07 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison,<br><br>It sounds like you are "motived" to lose weight. Thankfully, this does not matter (more on this latter). Commitment for me better describes what is required (more on this latter).<br><br>Since simple things like losing weight are easily complicated, I am going to post my thoughts over the course of a few posts. Consider this the introduction. <br><br>Your diabetes will complicate things, but not much. <br><br>I think rigorous honesty, especially to oneself, is important in all things. I will ask you a few questions along the way. I just ask that you are honest. <br><br>Alison, I will answer your questions as long as they do not venture into the minutia of nutrition and exercise or the "psychology of human motivation". These are interests of mine, but have no real bearing on losing weight or training non-elite athletes. Having too much information or too many choices is a great to flounder in any activity.<br><br>Anyone can lose weight. It is simple. It is not (always) pleasant, rewarding, fun, etc.<br><br>Good luck!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 18:30 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The formula for weight loss:<br><br>Losing weight is simple: Consume fewer calories over a period of time than you use.<br><br>That's it. We could stop there if we were not so hysterical about this simple fact.<br><br>Read the thread above. You ask a modest question. You received less than modest answers.<br><br>I mean no disrespect to Jacqueline, but her response is rather loaded. The response assumes too much. A website is needed or is useful? You have to make a decision to commit to wake up at 4am or find a dog to walk, buy a video game console? <br><br>Jacqueline is not alone. We know this. Books, gyms, DVDs, websites, etc are created and obfuscate this simple truth, they might give lip service to it, but they are not committed to it.<br><br>Losing weight is simple: Consume fewer calories over a period of time than you use.<br><br>If you don't honestly believe losing weight is this simple, then you might as well start buying those books, fitness gadgets, gym memberships, etc. which will go unused eventually and traded in for new ones.<br><br>Losing weight is simple: Consume fewer calories over a period of time then you use.<br><br>That's it. Onto the mechanics. <br><br>But if you disagree with this truth, let me know, so I can stop spending my time on these posts.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 18:47 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with Norman.  It is as simple as that.  More and more true dietitians (who have nothing to sell) are coming to this conclusion.  <br><br>Keeping active is important as well.  Do body weight exercises at home for 3 days a week (this can take as little as 15-30 minutes).  On the off days, spend 20-30 minutes doing something you enjoy (walk, run, swim, bike, basketball, whatever...)  And take one day to completely rest a day.   Again make it simple.  No need for weights or gym.  A simple pullup bar and possibly a exercise ball would be a good addition, but even then not absolutely necessary.  <br><br>Between eating less (of course eat more fruit and vegetables and less processed sugars) and doing a simple exercise program, you will notice a change in body and attitude within a very short time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 19:02 | Jonlat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman - I agree with you wholeheatedly - I think the method Mark used was a very simple way to do it because he was measuring his input against his weight and adjusting it to make sure he lost weight so allowing for any personal indiosyncracies. After all we are not all the same so the consumption that will cause me to loose weight might not work for the person sitting next to me.<br><br>I would also say that all the paraphanalia that goes with diet plans is very offputting to me - some people love it all, but I find it a huge bore!  I just want to get on with it and get to the desired result as painlessly as possible.<br><br>However, if you review my question you will find what I asked for was for some nice simple ways to include some exercise into my day that had a similarly easy method of accountability.  I'm not really interested in gyms and so on and I tend to go for a couple of weeks then never darken their doors again.  So I am looking for a way to move more, prefereably at home or in the fresh air around my home. The side effect of this will hopefully be a boost to the weight loss target and a healthier body.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 19:20 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The Mechanics:<br><br>You Can't Outrun a Donut.<br><br>That is the next simple truth. It is not as absolute as the first, but nearly. From that truth the we find the following:<br><br>Exercise is not necessary for losing weight. In fact, it can upset your efforts at losing weight (a little on this in this post and maybe more in another).<br><br>Exercise is not necessary for losing weight. This is the next truth you must believe, if you want to nearly guarantee your weight loss.<br><br>If you don't believe me, simply browse one of those websites which detail the caloric density of foods and the calories per hour any given activity burns. You literally cannot outrun a donut.<br><br>So you don't have to worry about "being a gym bunny", a Wii Fit, or exercising at all. The only muscle you will need to exercise properly is your jaw muscle.

Some people can do that by mentally tracking, some do it by keeping a log on paper, more power to whatever works for the individual, my way is just super easy and kind of fun.  Just like the Wii is fun, skiing is fun, walking the dog is enjoyable.<br><br>If one really wants to exercise for whatever reason, it's pretty much one of the easiest things to do.  Just get off your butt and do it.  My motivation isn't to use it to lose weight, it's to become stronger and feel more energetic.

(I found the site from mention on this forum many months ago - amazing what you learn here!) You set yourself a simple rule or habit to follow (eg do 14 mins exercise of some kind each day) and mark red/orange/green for achievement (or not) on a chart each day.  It gives personal accountability and if you define your 'rules' realistically and modestly, there's a chance that the incentive of seeing a row of greens on your chart will help compliance!  Good luck.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 20:15 | Jane EP</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the ideas and thoughts guys.<br><br>&lt;&lt;Oh, and to look smoking hot. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Oh me too!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 20:43 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's not completely true that exercise is not necessary for weight loss. The problem is that your body tends to first consume muscles before burning up excessive fat stored in the body. That's what happens with bed-ridden people if they don't eat well. A very modest amount of exercise keeps your muscles active, preventing them from being destroyed by your own metabolism.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2010 at 20:54 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>More on the terrible effects of exercise:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/health/research/26exer.html?em">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/health/research/26exer.html?em</a><br><br>Off to outwalk a handful of pretzels...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2010 at 22:22 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>OK, I'll leave you to your complications.

I can't recall the name of the study or the authors offhand.  I'm not sure if that's true or not since exercise does help with blood sugar levels which should lead to less eating.  I can't say that's been my personal experience either, since it generally has an appetite blunting effect for me - unless I'm doing something really strenuous like skiing hard all day or trying to bulk up a bit with weights.  <br><br>I suppose if one was only doing exercise purely for a caloric benefit rather than increased strength, a mood enhancer, pure enjoyment and love of sports - and increased cognitive function, that could be a deterrent.  Kind of throwing the baby out with the bathwater though.  And even if you start out doing it for that purpose, most people who get past that hump and into it and continue on realize that there are so many other benefits other than helping to keep their weight down.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2010 at 2:29 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Losing weight, argues Gary Taubes in a manner that I found convincing, is not about simply decreasing calories in and/or increasing calories out. <br><br>Of course, the first law of thermodynamics holds. But that simplistic equation leads people to assume that all calories are metabolically equivalent. <br><br>Taubes presents many journal articles supporting the conclusion that calorie QUALITY is as important, if not more important, than calorie QUANTITY. Some kinds of dietary calories can provide us with energy that is readily accessible for our cells to metabolize, so that we feel energetic and eager to increase the "calories out" side of the equation.<br><br>Other dietary calories can be consumed, and yet we feel even more hungry and more lethargic and fatigued, thereby reducing our calorie expenditure. Thus, these calories lead us to both increase intake and decrease expenditure, leading to weight gain.<br><br>Yes, the first law of thermodynamics cannot be avoided. But it can best be deployed by those whose goal is weight loss by recognizing that it is not true that "a calorie is a calorie."<br><br>Calories have qualities or kinds. Some kinds of calories increase satiation and energy expenditure. Some kinds of calories decrease satiation and energy expenditure. It would behoove the prospective dieter to discover for themself which kinds are the former and which kinds are the latter.<br><br>Good Calories Bad Calories<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Gary-Taubes/dp/1400040787">http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Gary-Taubes/dp/1400040787</a><br><br>Article on Exercise<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://nymag.com/news/sports/38001/">http://nymag.com/news/sports/38001/</a><br><br>I hate to mention this, but I can't resist, that the entire question of weight loss is completely academic to me. I have, all my life, battled against being underweight. Nonetheless, the ideas Taubes presents, have helped me normalize my weight.<br><br>Nutritional debates quickly tend to become heated and fanatical. I find Taubes to be quite level-headed in his approach. He concludes his book not by claiming that he knows all the answers and has discovered the best diet. There are not doubt many effective diets with many different macronutrient ratios. We all would be served by better, rigorous research that teases out the causal roles of the factors Taubes considers. In the meantime, we can each, individually, take a more experimental approach in our own diets. <br><br>I have found that about 70% of what Taubes writes is helpful in my personal situation, and about 30% just doesn't work. Yet I know that the 30% that doesn't work for me, works fantastically for other people.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2010 at 20:29 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It isn't just the calorie, it is the rest of what makes up the food.  I've recently lost 45 lbs on the Fast-5 diet.  Sure, I lost them because I am eating less.  That is the calorie part.  <br><br>But the way my mind works made the fast part easy.  But it doesn't work out that way for everyone.  One thing it does appear to do is help us listen to our body better.  We tend to eat what our body wants and less of things that aren't needed.

What people really want is to:<br><br>1) Be healthy,<br><br>2) Feel good and have energy,<br><br>3) Look good.<br><br>So it's the tape measure, skin calipers, blood work, other biomarkers, the mirror, and how you feel, not the bathroom scales, that tell the real tale.  Focusing too much on the scales can throw you off course.<br><br>With that in mind I'd like to recommend the best book I've come across on weight loss:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Live-Revolutionary-Formula-Sustained/dp/0316735507/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264979119&amp;sr=1-1">http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Live-Revolutionary-Formula-Sustained/dp/0316735507/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264979119&amp;sr=1-1</a><br><br>What really impresses me about Dr. Fuhrman's book is the extent to which he has studied the relevant scientific research and has based his recommendations on it.  Some of you might be particularly interested in the chapter in which he discusses the Atkins, Sears (Zone), and South Beach diets.  He argues persuasively, in my nonprofessional opinion, that they are contradicted by the scientific research, risky, and (at least in the case of Atkins) dangerous.  He also shows by simple arithmetic that Barry Sears cannot possibly have followed his own diet to lose weight.<br><br>Another thoroughly researched book, The China Study by Colin Campbell (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/1932100660/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264980091&amp;sr=1-1">http://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/1932100660/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264980091&amp;sr=1-1</a> ) strongly supports Fuhrman's point of view.  Anyway, you can read the books and decide for yourselves.

He had an essay which was to be a book that he has yet to write called evolutionary fitness.  The goal is to eat like we genetically evolved to eat and exercise the same way.  <br><br>So put simply you eat fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein and nuts.  You do not eat, dairy, rice, pasta bread and packaged food since grains were introduced relatively recently to mans diet.  You do not count calories, you will not need to.  Some days you can fast if you like.<br><br>For exercise you do not run long slow distances or use exercise bikes or overtrain.  You do things like walk and then sprint a bit, hike and lift weights maybe two days a week using a rep scheme of 16 increase weight, 8 increase weight, 4.  Doing just a few exercises for the major muscle groups.   <br><br>He has a website with some free info and some which he now charges for, but if you google him, you will find the information you need in articles on the net.  <br><br>This stuff works, I have used it very successfully.

You can loose weight eating 1500 calories of junk versus a need of 1800 calories, but your health will suffer, surely even you know this.  <br><br>I know what has worked for me and I stick with it.  Call it wacky, but the western diet has been a disaster in terms of obesity and disease.  If it was so great why do you hear lap band comemrcials all day and have people discussing childhood obesity.<br><br>I follow the eating and exercise program, don't bother counting calories and I get the results I need.

But time management is pretty simple, too, isn't it? Do what needs doing in your 16 hours a day and don't agree to do more than you can do. <br><br>We do complicate matters, but isn't that because we're all different? I know someone who lost weight permanently by walking every day. I know someone else who lost weight by giving up wheat that she was intolerant to. I lost mine because I let go and let God. Is there a *right* way to lose weight or is there a way that works for each person? I think we should encourage people to try different approaches to see what works at this particular point in their lives. That attitude prevents the fear of failure which I believe produces failure to lose weight all too often. <br><br>As for exercise, I am a huge proponent of weight lifting. It's far too often ignored when people are trying to lose weight. Looking smoking hot requires muscle tone and so does good health for that matter. I know some very sickly thin people. The more muscle mass you have, the more calories you can take in and for some people with slower metabolisms, that can be a big plus. It is for me! :-)<br><br>I'm interested to hear your approach, Norman. I think it would be better to read what you think works, though, rather than what you think doesn't.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2010 at 22:28 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel,<br><br>Norman is right within limits.  If calories in equal calories out weight will remain stable ... SO LONG AS METABOLISM DOES NOT VARY.  But it does.  That is why a starvation diet does not work.  The body goes into a starvation mode and lowers its caloric requirements so as to protect itself.  So you can take in fewer calories and not lose weight.  And that is why weight lifting DOES work ... it alters metabolism so your caloric requirements go up so you lose weight on the same number of calories that used to maintain it before the exercise.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2010 at 1:37 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You're absolutely right, Mike.
