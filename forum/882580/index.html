I've tried this, but it didn't work for me. If felt like, well, work. Here's my problem... while I don't want to be stuck in AF mode all day, as a solopreneur, I don't work 9-5 hours. So my choices are:<br><br>a) AF mode always<br>b) AF mode during specific times <br>c) AF mode whenever the need/feeling hits <br><br>a) feels too laborious <br>c) creates the very problems that I'm trying to avoid by using AF<br>b) may work, but how would I handle AF rules (particularly the new system) if I did it at set times. <br><br>Any help/tips would be appreciated.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 1:21 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To clarify, my issue with "c" is the following: how do I handle items that I've dealt with OUTSIDE of AF 4 time?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 1:24 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;&gt;To clarify, my issue with "c" is the following: how do I handle items that I've dealt with OUTSIDE of AF 4 time? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>If I come across an item in my AF list that's already done, I just cross it off (and count it as a completed task).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 3:53 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim - that's what I've been doing. However I'd imagine I'd be prone to doing the "active list" tasks when not using my AF list. Which is a concern because the power of AF is the "pressure" of wanting to get to the "active list" while doing the backlog. Or am I missing something?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 5:01 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Working the Closed List (AKA Backlog) is like AF1 -- compared to AF2 and RAF, it happens at a more leisurely, contemplative pace.  There isn't the tyranny of the urgent always demanding attention.  You can really let your rationality and intuition work together to focus on what's really important.  <br><br>The only time there is the pressure to get past it and move to the Open List (AKA Active List) is when there are urgent tasks there, which are (consciously or subconsciously) pressing on you.  <br><br>So, when you do finally turn to your AF4 list, after your time of randomly working on urgent tasks, I imagine you'd still have some anxiety over outstanding urgent tasks.  So, you'd probably skip through the Closed List and quickly start working on your Open List.   And here, you'd find several items are completed already.  And maybe a few are still left that need your attention.  So, you work on them.  And maybe work on them some more.  And then move on to the Closed List and work in that mode for awhile (unless the Tyranny of the Urgent calls you back to the Open List).<br><br>I just don't see how having some of these items completed already when you come to the list is a problem.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 6:01 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Seraphim. <br><br>Anyone else willing to divulge how often the use AF during the day/night?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 6:37 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good Morning Avrum,<br><br>I can't speak directly to AF4 because I don't have experience yet.  I just spent my first full day being a Mark clone ;-)<br><br>But my previous (and possibly future) approach was to use AF as a part of my system, the part that I used when I was not using the other parts.  So my approach was:<br><br>- Start the day<br>- Get my coffee, rub my eyes, and scan my AF list<br>- Cull items of urgency to another "Must Do Today" list<br>- Review the Calendar and do the same<br>- Think about how I want my day to go<br>- Lay out a schedule ... blocking time for my Must Do items<br>- Block time for my want to do items<br>- Block time for some fun things<br><br>- START WORKING on the Schedule<br>- At every "choice point" or "break" of any kind, review the Must Do list<br>- When I have a break in the Schedule, and when the Must Dos are stalled or competed<br>- Start in on the AF list<br>- After a while processing the AF list (usually another "break" or "choice point") go back to the schedule and repeat the cycle<br><br>Does the day always go so perfectly?  Of course not.  But at least I am centered around a schedule and my priority items and when I am "drifting" for some reason, I have the AF list to offer me lots of choices.<br><br>As to it feeling like work ... egad, being in Mark's skin yesterday was exhausting.  Keeping a time log kept me honest and I was only able to work for a little over 6 hours before I was seeing double.  So I do see your point "a", above,  But I did clear out a lot of things that had been hanging around for a good long time ... and not BIG things either.  Nits, most of them.  I have no idea why they had not gotten done sooner. And the result of that is this morning I'm energized and eager to get to work again.<br><br>Then there is the long standing advice: just put more "fun" items on your list.  IOW, you'll hit something that takes you off of the AF list for a while and when the time seems right, that's what you'll do.  The trick is having a way to get back on the list again.<br><br>As to loosing the "pressure" by doing things out of order, I don't see that happening with AF4.  The pressure comes from the whole sale dismissal of the closed list if you go through it without doing something.  And I found that going through the open list only once before having to go back to the closed list, put pressure on me to do as many of those things as possible before I had to leave it for several cycles through the open list.  It does seem to work pretty well.  But time will tell ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 9:04 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>&lt;&lt; being in Mark's skin yesterday was exhausting. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, and when I look at the following list of actions I feel exhausted too.

I have to actually push a button for that one.  ;-)<br><br>What wore me out yesterday, was sticking to the list.  That is so much not my style of working so I thought I ought to give it a try.  I had no idea it would be that tiring.  It is not what I'm doing so much as having to work from a list to do it.  This morning I knocked off some reading that was on the list.  So there was not much real effort but the strain of going back to a list to get to it is surprising.  I wonder if I keep this up for a few days will it get better?  Time will tell, I guess.<br><br>Anyway, I'm three hours into my day and have worked on the list for one hour (by my time log) in which effort I've closed 4 tasks and added 15 &lt;sigh&gt;  I've spent about an hour on non-list computer activity (email ... which I don't have on my list yet ... maybe I should? ... and posting here.)  The other hour was start of day overhead (coffee, feeding cats, cleaning litter box, showering and so on).  It is interesting to see where the time goes.<br><br>But I DID put breakfast, lunch, and dinner on my list, first thing this morning ... oh, that reminds me, I get to cross off breakfast ... I did not eat because I saw the task, I was just passing by the fridge to clean the liter box and realized I was hungry so grabbed some cottage cheese.  I guess if I had not done that, I'd have come to "breakfast" in another 30 minutes or so.  Fascinating game ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 11:06 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>I can only speak from my own experience, but I don't find working off the list tiring. I did on Friday because I was having to do it in a way that was unnatural to me, but normally I find the overhead of a written list is just about zero.<br><br>As I think I said in an earlier post, the only reason I put things like "Lunch" on the list is to remind me to eat it when I'm going in full flow. <br><br>Email I definitely do have on my list. That way I always stay totally on top of it. Same thing with Comments on this Forum.<br><br>After Friday, I took two days off from the list, and I've spent most of this morning so far catching up with the chaos left by not sticking with it!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 11:30 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Mike and Mark. <br><br>I'm thinking of delegating a set # of hours in the morning/afternoon/evening to working AF. To start, I'd say 1 hour should suffice. For example, from 9-10AM, 1-2PM, and 7-8PM I'll work from my AF list. We'll see how ti goes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 15:33 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've decided to work from my AF4 list whenever I'm at home, between 10am-10PM. <br><br>Why?<br><br>1) No suitable iPhone app has been released to work with either of my preferred setups (taskpaper or officetime)<br><br>2) Procrastination mostly  occur at <br><br>3) When I leave my house to go to a coffee shop, I'm limited to what I want to get done (helps with focus). <br><br>I'll try this for a week and report my results.

How productive would you be?  and then would the addition of the iphone make an impact on that larger than 1%?<br><br>I know that sometimes when I try new tools I bend over backwards to include them in my 'productivity' system and then realize it doesn't influence all that much. <br><br>Having said that, when I was still using AF I used a timed approach like yours, I'd set out a time to work of the list.

And I believe this is true for productivity systems as well. System to system, I haven't been more productive per se. However the system itself does make me want to use it more or less. <br><br>&gt;&gt; I bend over backwards to include them in my 'productivity' system and then realize it doesn't influence all that much.<br><br>I agree. And I wish pencil/paper worked for me. But the lack of metrics, search, backups and messing handwriting pushes me towards gadgets. Plus, a new gadget refreshes the system. <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 1:32 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;I agree.

Plus, a new gadget refreshes the system. <br><br>I'm the same boat as you Avrum, I do write a lot, but the longer the list I put on paper in my handwriting the less likely I'm to work from the list. It works better when I just write short lists of say 3 things to do. Those get done. But AF style lists have to be done digitally for me, the handwritten approach just doesn't suit me. <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 23:13 | Peter Knight</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
