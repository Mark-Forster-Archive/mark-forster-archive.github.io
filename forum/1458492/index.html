I'm at the point where I have filled up one bound notebook.  I see four possibilities (P) for continuing into a new notebook…<br><br>P1. Just carry both around until the last few pages of the old one are completed, dismissed, &amp; reviewed.  <br><br>P2. Finish visit to the current page in the old notebook, then dismiss it and the rest of the pages. Add "Review dismissed tasks from old notebook" as the first task in the new one. Then go back to the old notebook just once more, when this new review task stands out. <br><br>P3. Copy the remaining tasks into the new notebook.  (For my current situation, this would require two pages.)<br><br>P4. Copy the remaining pages as they stand, including completed, dismissed, and crossed out items.  (For my current situation, this would take up four pages.) <br><br>P4 would function in the same way as P1, but require more tedious work.<br><br>I think I'll choose P2.  I like the idea of starting the new notebook without lots of old entries. But I'll probably reenter most of them soon.  I would enjoy reading about how others have handled this issue.  I think this is the first time I'm starting a new notebook using the same system (SF Version 3)!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 April 2011 at 19:16 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for this thread ubi. I'm there this weekend too. <br><br>I hadn't gotten far enough to lay out the possibilities.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 0:47 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've tried all those (with AF or SF), plus:<br><br>P5. Enter a new task in Column 2 of your new book:  "Copy forward tasks from old notebook".   On each iteration, copy as many tasks as you feel like copying.  Keep moving this task forward in Column 2 until it's done.<br><br>Even with only about 15 pages with tasks remaining, this was time-consuming, and that old notebook hung around for a couple of weeks.  What a bother.<br><br>The one I liked best is your P2.   But I think I'd give myself one more pass through the old notebook.  Anything left after that final pass is dismissed.   Presumably I've had plenty of opportunities to take action on most of the tasks that are still in there -- the final pass is there to take care of anything that's still fairly "current" or "fresh" -- probably in the last few pages of the notebook.  <br><br>Of course I'd enter a new task in my new notebook:  "Review dismissed tasks in old notebook".   I'd keep re-entering it in Column 1 of my new notebook as long as I still have any anxiety about that old notebook.  Once the anxiety is gone, I'd finally delete that task and put the old notebook in a time capsule for future archaeologists to puzzle over.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 6:14 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Also note that Mark Forster has generally recommended that one just toss the old notebook (or file it away for posterity).   He has expressed the opinion that anything that really needs to get done will find its way into your new book by itself.   <br><br>If that's the way your mind works, then great, go for it!! <br><br>It makes me too anxious, though, so I want at least that one more pass through the old notebook before dismissing all everything that remains, plus the chance to review all the dismissed items.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 6:16 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Ubi and others.  Yesterday I moved to a new notebook.   I had 30 active pages in the old notebook.   I copied all the tasks over into Column 1 of the new notebook, using a thick coloured line to show where a page-worth of tasks  in the old notebook ended.  <br><br>So although the new notebook only has 6 actual pages, there are 30 'old' pages in it.   For the purposes of dismissal, each 'old' page will be treated individually.  <br><br>Of course, this will affect the way Column 2 works: Column 2 on the first actual page will cover 6 'old' pages, so it will fill up more quickly than normal.  <br><br>I listed all the dismissed tasks from the old notebook on the back page of the new notebook, and have a recurring task to review them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 10:21 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use it as an opportunity to review and prune and then start a new notebook by writing the remaining tasks into it.  I personally can not rely on memory.  Another option if you don't like rewriting is to use a loose leaf notebook and add and pull pages.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 17:54 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the comments, y'all!<br><br>I ended up doing a variant of P2.  I changed my "review old dismissed"  task to cover only the most-recently-dismissed Page N, added "review old dismissed p. N-1," did a few other tasks, reviewed N-1, etc., until the old notebook review was complete.  This all took place within the same afternoon.  Usually, I wait a day or more before reviewing a dismissed page, and review the oldest-dismissed first.  But the rapid review worked out well, probably because SF seems to keep my list to only a few active pages (compared to earlier systems). And I chose not to reenter several tasks, so my new notebook is not too overwhelming.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 22:26 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I did a cross between P2 and P3. I went through each page and decided for the tasks left whether they should be moved to the new book or dismissed. I think it was about half and half. I ended up with about a page and a third of new C1 tasks and a handful in C2 of the first page. <br><br>I highlighted the ones to be dismissed in a different color from the last time (after the talk of different highlighting colors I found a nice pack of highlighters in my office with a dark blue and a dark red. I'm going to alternate between those).<br><br>I'm going through my previously dismissed items now. I'll go through these recent ones in a day or two.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2011 at 22:55 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There is a way to avoid this situation: use a notebook with replaceable pages (like Levenger circa or Atoma)...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2011 at 9:01 | Christian G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's time for another new notebook!  Looks like I'm running at a rate of about one (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/)">http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/)</a> 23-double-page pocket notebook per month. I have more active pages remaining in the old notebook this time, so this might be a bit of a challenge to get through without carrying two notebooks for a while. I'm going to try the same technique that worked well the last time. I'll let y'all know how it goes…</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 May 2011 at 18:51 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm down to the one new notebook. Had five active pages in the old one, that I dismissed at once yesterday. It took me until late in the evening to review and reenter some tasks from these five old pages (in reverse order), alternating the one-page reviews with other "real" tasks. Currently, the new notebook has only two active pages. Feels good to have the list consolidated.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2011 at 0:40 | ubi</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
