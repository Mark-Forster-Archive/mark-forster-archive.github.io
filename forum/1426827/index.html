I've tried a few other TM tools, and none seemed to handle my usual work profile all that well; to get more on-topic, I did try AF1 when it came out, and also a personal system that's almost the same as 3 tasks.<br><br>Has anyone found any of Mark's systems lend themselves particularly well to the (mainly reactive, but we're working on that!) work profile of "the techie"?  I'd like to give one or two of them a try, but am trying to narrow the field a bit before I start!<br><br>D.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2011 at 13:56 | Derek</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'd give Superfocus a shot.

Handling them this way seems like it should work, as the repeating / never-ending task will always be re-entered in Column 2 of the next page once some work was done on it.<br><br>Now I just need to make sure things are phrased correctly (possibly GTD-style Next Actions, but maybe not) so that I can trundle through the pages at a decent rate.<br><br><br>Anyone have anything to add, or suggestions for other ideas?<br><br>D.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2011 at 15:18 | Derek</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan - I'm reading the second sentence to mean there are two "conyinuous" tasks that always get re-entered once worked on.<br><br>The first is to work on the call log - in my case, the Hell-Desk ticket queue.<br><br>The second is to work through checklists (held outside of SF) of stuff that needs to be done at some point each day (not at a fixed time, things that need to happen at fixed times or on certain days would be in my Notes Calendar).<br><br><br>D.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2011 at 15:26 | Derek</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Derek,<br><br>Exactly what I had in mind. <br><br>I hope this will leave you a few lines to work on the improvements you mention, and on other priorities.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Alan,<br><br>Sorry if this was a bit opaque to anyone who hasn't worked in this area.

I tend to write "Username @ TICKETNUMBER, keyword1 keyword 2" enough info so that I know who it's for, and likely what it's about; and the ticket number helps me use the ticket system search feature to go straight to it when I decide to work on it.<br><br>I have found that this forces me to work on the tickets in a much more timely manner. My usual backlog was around 80-100 before AF1,  60-80 with AF1, and about 30-40 with SFv3.<br><br>This also allows me balance the support tickets equally amongst all the routine sysadmin work and the project and development stuff we do.<br><br>With AF1 and two recurring tasks as proposed in this thread; I'd have about 200 tasks on ten pages and another 80-100 in tickets. With SFv3 and everything in the system as discrete entries I'm well under 60 items and holding. Warning though it was really slow going when I first loaded the backlog it took about 2 weeks for the momentum to get rolling</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2011 at 8:36 | Bob Pankratz</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>grrr. still can't revise...<br><br>Should have said<br><br>Warning though it was really slow going when I first loaded the backlog it took about 2 weeks for the momentum to get rolling. In another post I suggested started with a blank list and a recurring task that says "enter 4-5 tasks from the backlog into COL1" in your case I would do the same "enter 4-5 tasks from call queue" to phase stuff into the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2011 at 8:41 | Bob Pankratz</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Not to highjack the SF3 thing because I think it would work marvelously, but ever thought of a personal Kanban.

THAT is why I've been resisting the idea of shoving all of the calls in to any sort of list; there are some in there that I just plain would rather avoid.  Obvious, but needed a push of some kind for me to think about it in the right way.<br><br>Erik - thanks for the idea; I've only limited exposure to the kanban idea, and I'm not sure of how best (or most easily) to implement it at the moment.  I may re-visit this in time (note to self: add "Investigate personal kanban" to your list).<br><br><br>Thanks, all - your input is much appreciated!  I suspect I'll try Bob's idea of adding things to the list in batches, at least to try to clear some of the backlog I've been resisting.  If that works, I'll give both ideas ("all in lists" and "trigger actions to look at queue/checklists") a fair shot once I've carved out a little breathing space and see how they both handle things on an ongoing basis.<br><br><br>Thanks again all.<br><br>D.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2011 at 16:47 | Derek</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
