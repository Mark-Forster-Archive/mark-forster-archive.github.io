I get a massive amount of emails for my work. I also forward links or attachments to anything I may want to do into my outlook inbox. I have three rules set up. Rule 1) anything that I am cc'd on goes to its on cc inbox 2) anything that has 'af in its subject line goes to my af folder (more on that later) 3) Anything that has 'aaf on my subject line goes to my Add to AF folder.<br><br>Reminders: ios. If I think of something on the fly I make a reminder on my iphone using Siri. <br><br>That's all for collection tools.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2014 at 15:41 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The tools I use for doing: My Action Book<br><br>Analog: I have two Moleskine notebooks, both 5X8 (classic), one ruled and one grid. One is my "Action Book," one is my "Project Book"<br><br>Action Book. There are two parts to the Action book, one starts on the first page and goes forward, one starts on the last page and works backwards. On the first page is my action list. I will write more about this when I get to the doing section but it is a running list of all actions I commit myself to. I add to the list throughout the day and at the start of each day I put the date before the first action I write for the day.<br><br>From the last page of the book working forwards are my nonaction lists. Each list has its own page, and they grow onto two or more pages. I make an index on the inside back cover (on the pocket) that lists which pages a list is on. This is important because lists are on nonconsecutive pages. My lists include:<br>Deadlines, the deadline and the date<br>Waiting for, the name of who I am waiting for, the date added and what I am waiting for<br>The someday maybe list, things I have not committed to yet<br>Tickler lists, one line for each day and an action that must start on that day<br>A home list for things that can ONLY be done at home<br>A routine list, things I do regularly, with the interval listed before the action<br>Agenda lists for all my direct reports and people I work with.<br><br>That's the action book.<br><br>My project book has a table of contents with each project listed as I create on. and each double page represents a project.

More about that in my next post</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2014 at 15:59 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The Daily Driver and the Hotlist<br><br>When I arrive to my desk in the morning, half to three quarters asleep, I don't want to think, I don't want to miss anything, and I do want to define my day correctly so I open my daily driver checklist in evernote and do things in order:<br><br>1) I clear my desk<br>2) I break out my secret weapon: A slightly smaller than 5X8 lined post it note I call my hot list<br>3) I look at todays calendar. All meetings go on the hotlist<br>4) I look at my list of deadlines. Anything coming up or anything the screams out to me goes on the hotlist<br>5) I look at my tickler list, add today's stuff on the hotlist<br>6) I look at my routine stuff, it goes on the hotlist.  Two daily routines are Inbox and CPORD. Inbox is email and I will talk about CPORD later.<br>7) I do a quick scan of emails where I am on the to address line, if something needs to go on the hotlist, there it goes.<br>8) Yesterday's hotlist. 99% of all days there is nothing left on the hotlist. If there is something, onto today's hotlist. More often though, seeing a crossed out item on yesterdays hotlist spurs me to add something new (particularly with projects), on the hotlist it goes.<br>9) I scan my project book table of contents quickly, if something jumps out, it goes on the hotlist.<br><br>My hotlist has not been populated. I have 11 lines on the post it. I may or may not have filled it thus far. Usually, if it is a day with a lot of meetings, it's full and sometimes I have a second column.  Otherwise it may be 1/3  full. I try not to go beyond the 11 lines.  <br><br>As mentioned above I have other inboxes besides email. I process those next (ios reminders, notetaker wallet and my legal pad. These items may go on the hotlist, but usually just go in the action book if it is an action, my project book if it is project related and not an action for me to do right now, or my waiting for/agendas lists. If it is a project with a deadline, it also goes on my deadline page. <br><br>Finally I take a look at yesterdays action list in my book (not my hotlist post it). If my hotlist is not too full and something "stands out" I also add it to my hot list. <br><br>This whole process takes about 15 minutes and it sets my rules of what I am going to do for the day. It is almost the last time I have to think about my work for the day, the rest of my day is just do, do,do. More on that in my next post.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2014 at 16:31 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So now it is time to do. And like many of us, I have been converted to the randomizer. I use Random.org integer function and I made a very long list of integers between 1-31 (as I have 31 lines on a moleskine page). I circle the first open number, star from the first line on my hotlist and go down. When the hotlist ends I go to yesterdays list on my moleskine book. When I count through yesterdays list I go back to the hotlist. I follow Mark's rules of crossing out and sliding. I also follow the little and often rule. IF I do not finish a task I wither write it on the hotlist, if I intend to do more today or in the action list if I am done with it for the day.<br><br>I like mixing the hotlist with the tasks I wrote in my action book yesterday because it adds variety and makes sure that I keep momentum going on projects that are important but not  urgent. How do I make sure that everything gets done on the hotlist when I am also working on yesterdays list in my action book? I spend, on average less time on the tasks on the action book, sometimes only working 5 minutes on a longer task there, making sure I end a logical point and rewriting the next step on today's action book so I can continue the process tomorrow.  <br><br>My next post will adress why I put meetings on the hotlist, how I process my inbox and what CPORD means.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2014 at 16:42 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>CPORD and my email in box.<br><br>Two keys to my system is practicing CPORD throughout the week and my new way of processing my inbox.<br><br>CPORD stands for Collect Process Organize Review and Do, the process that David Allen recommends in Getting Things Done. I break them out by day. Monday I collect, Tuesday I process, etc through Friday.<br><br>Collect for me is making sure all paper is gathered and entered in my books, all ios reminders are in my books, etc. I try to keep up on this daly so it is about 5 minutes of time.<br><br>Process means going through my email inbox. I have email inbox in on my hotlist every day but I get too many emails to fully process every day. That is ok, I process my to: emails first nd my cc emails second, doing a quick scan as part of my daily driver, processing some each day and a lot more on Tuesday as part of PRocess.<br><br>I process emails using the David Allen, is it actionable question. If no, it may get deleted, moved to a agenda waiting for or someday maybe list or go into my project book. IF it goes into my project book, I forward the email to my self with a more descriptive subject line than what the addressor used and I add 'af. I copy the new subject line in my project book under the right project and hit send. Because I have a rule set to move that email directly into my af folder I never see it in my inbox. Then when it is time for me to retrieve it, I type what I wrote in my analog book into Outlook search and the message comes right up. Since it is easy to have attachments in email, I put a lot of project reference material in my system this way.<br><br>For actionable email I do the same 'af process but write it in my action book.. Sometimes on the hotlist but usually on today's date so I can act on it tomorrow.<br><br>I also process email on my phone when I don't have my books available. In those cases I type 'aaf instead of 'af .  aaf stands for add to autofocus-- it goes to a different folder and I process those emails easily when I have my action book by copying the subject and moving the emails to the af folder.<br><br>That takes care of the C and P in CPORD. I'll talk about ORD in my next post.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2014 at 16:59 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Vegheadjones,<br><br>I like your requirements in the first post, but after reading just what you have written so far about your system, I am not sure how such a complicated system with so many pieces can possibly satisfy this requirement:<br><br>"Must be focused on doing, not on organizing or reviewing"<br><br>It seems to me that the Final Version meets all of your requirements in the OP, and especially this one.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2014 at 19:44 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Austin,<br><br>That is a good question. I used FV for a while, but it did not fit my criteria. Too many decisions involved. Did I want to do this before that, that before this, etc. <br><br>With this system, I set it up in the AM, then no thinking about what to do next until the next morning (barring interruptions of course). I don't think I just...do.<br><br>Your new FV system may also have that sense of doing, I like that you dont make a chain, but, as others have commented, randomizing is just too much fun.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2014 at 20:04 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Finsihing off my series of posts on my system...<br><br>I talked about how I maintain the overhead by practicing CPORD. Each day I do a letter, Monday is C for collect, Tuesday is P for processing, you can see my earlier post for what that entails. <br><br>Wednesday is Organize. Here I go through all tasks in my action book and copy relevant items to my project book. This includes actions on the list that are really not ready to be done, they get crossed of and entered on the project book on the right project page, actions that are ready to be done but I want to track on the relavent project page as well, and actions that I realize are projects in disguise. Those get a new project page.<br><br>Thursday is review. This is similar to a traditional GTD weekly review, but fast! It involves going through all the back pages in my action book (waiting fors, agendas, tickler, someday/maybeetc) and a quick review of my action book to see if anything needs to be reworded and reentered, or just crossed out. Then I go through my project book and make sure every project has a next action on my action book.<br><br>I get the entire review done in under 25 minutes--just one Pomodoro!<br><br>Friday I Do, which means when DO randomly comes up on my hotlist, I start at the beginning of the action book and go forward from there until either I get to yesterdays page, or I see I need to move forward on items on my hotlist. <br><br>And there you have it. My entire system in a (granted large) nutshell. I know this will be helpful for me as I reflect on my system and perhaps for you as well.

It really is (thus far) and effective and easy system for me, but I think it appears complicated for two reasons: 1) I wanted to get down the entire system-- including how I process my inbox, manage projects, handle deadlines, do reviews et al. The actual action component is just Mark's randomized DIT methodology with the addition of a hotlist. And 2) I wrote this very much as a rough draft mind dump of what I do. It will probably be helpful to me, and perhaps others, to go back and do a second, more organized draft. I'll add that to my someday maybe list. :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2014 at 11:47 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I admit, I can see the simplicity and the "mostly doing" now that I have  the full picture. It does have a lot of components and rules, but you've got everything on autopilot, and it only had to be set up once.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2014 at 12:21 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for posting this - I like seeing all the details, though it took some time to read through it.   <br><br>I want to make sure I understood your Action Book correctly, and the way you work it.  It sounds like you have one day to really focus on things that appear in your Action Book.   Here is what I think you are saying. <br><br>(Day 1) New tasks get written on the Day 2 Action Page<br><br>(Day 2) During your Daily Driver startup, you scan your Day 2 Action Page, and copy things that stand out to your Hotlist, if your Hotlist has room.   During the day as you take action, you cycle between your Hotlist and your Day 2 action page.   Actioned but unfinished items get re-entered on Day 3's page.<br><br>(Day 3) If there was anything left on your Day 2 action page, it fades from your attention, to be reviewed on Thursdays, and to be actioned on Fridays, but otherwise getting no attention. <br><br>Did I summarize the mechanics correctly?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2014 at 21:33 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Also, you can save yourself a step by using IFTTT.com to automatically send your iOS reminders to yourself at your Outlook email account.   It's very handy.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2014 at 21:35 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim,<br><br>I did have ITTT send my reminders to Toodledo back in the day, but I hadn't thought of sending them to outlook. Good idea.<br><br>I don't think you go the hotlist part of Day2 exactly right. WHile I do look and move things over from the previous day, that is very little of what drives my hotlist. My deadlines sheet (which may be similar in some ways to your personal Kanban) provides most of my hotlist items, my calendar is second and my project list is third. By that point anything from yesterday that is undone is either already on the list (deadline or priority project oriented) or does not need to be there.<br><br>Actioned and unfinished items go either on the hotlist to do again today or tomorrow's list depending on priority, mood, etc. Today was a busy day. I had 22 things on my hotlist (two columns). 6 items got reentered.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2014 at 23:44 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>And you are right that unactioned tasks on a given day may not get reviewed until Thursday, but I am finding that is OK.

And what is your work like?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 March 2014 at 20:37 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks!   Just trying to get a clearer picture of how it works.   Another thread ( <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2031914">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2031914</a> ) prompted me to make an initial drawing of how I think your system works - at least the basics of the Action Book and Hotlist.    Does this capture it?<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/25td1mkd5a05q7m/hotlist%20conveyor%20belt.png">http://www.dropbox.com/s/25td1mkd5a05q7m/hotlist%20conveyor%20belt.png</a><br><br>Your list looks like the typical stuff that appears on my list also:  a mixture of the urgent, the important, and the will-be-important-and-urgent-soon-if-you-neglect-it-long-enough things.<br><br>It's interesting to consider how urgency and importance change over time:   some things are important, and have no deadline, but need urgent attention lest they become irrelevant:  a missed opportunity.   Some things don't seem important, and don't feel urgent, but if you neglect them long enough they start to demand attention and get in the way of everything else.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2014 at 21:35 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim,<br><br>I love your diagram, and a conveyor belt is an apt metaphor for what I do, with these exceptions:<br><br>Things don't go on the conveyor belt right away. If I add something to my action list, and not to my hotlist, I follow DIT rules and do not take action on it until tomorrow. So there is a one day holding pattern.<br><br>And, unlike DWM (which I liked a lot and used for a while) nothing automatically falls off the conveyor belt. They stay on my action list until I either move it to the hotlist (based on my daily review of deadline and project lists),  park it somewhere else (project list or someday) or delete it based on my Wednesday organizing of my action list or do it, usually on Friday when I allow the randomizer to take me past the hotlist and tasks written down yesterday.<br><br>Your definition of missed opportunity is right on. You can't automate determining what is important to do right now, but you can rig the system to acknowledge it. That's what I do with the hotlist.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 March 2014 at 20:11 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi,<br><br>A quick update on my system above. Still at it and still following the same methodology with a few modifications.<br><br>1) I know longer use a project book, but moved to Trello for projects. All actions still go in the book and I use the randomizer methodology (with some alterations listed below) to chose what to do next, but if it is project related I corss check with Trello to see about any associated project actions I can do. I am happy to explain this in more detail if there is interest.<br><br>2) I use my action book more as a bullet journal, that is I keep notes and action items together. IF my randomizer falls on a nonaction item, I read it, act on it if needed, or move it to a reference spot or to Trello<br><br>3) I have been sticking to randomizing the hotlist and completing it before turning to the book.<br><br>4) I have been prioritizing items in the book with an "!" After I go through the hotlist I randomize through all "!"s before I get to anything else. <br><br>5) When it is time to do non "!" things I randomize yesterday, then the list from 30 days ago, then the list from 7 days ago. It is my way of keeping DWM alive!<br><br>6) After that I randomize through the whole book. At least in theory, I have yet to get to 6). 1 and 2 is the farthest I get, which is why the weekly review and daily hotlist are key.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 April 2014 at 18:40 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The first steps few are similar to what I did before falling off the wagon for a month. (Blame the video game, not the system. Then a few brain-sucking research projects.) It's also how I'm climbing back on the wagon.<br><br>The review and hot list ensure the must-dos aren't forgotten. Randomizing keeps things fresh at each priority level.<br><br>I haven't used the middle level of marks in the book, but I suspect that keeps you from having permission to work on an unimportant project rather than make progress on something more valuable.<br><br>I use Colley's rule to fill that role. If random gives me something that is a good use of the moment, may as well do it. If I start looking for the best use of my time, I'll talk myself out of doing things rather than into. If it doesn't give me a good use of the next moment (energy, time, or blocked) I use Colley's rule to find one. Usually only one step, but if I see the next line is an even better use, then common sense applies.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 April 2014 at 19:47 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thank you for describing your system so thoroughly, vegheadjones. I have borrowed some ideas from it, which have worked out well. In particular, I've been using a "daily driver" on some days to go through my calendar, inboxes, and sometimes lists (if I'm not using an algorithm-driven system), and on some days I'll write a "hot list" based on those things and go through those items. These elements have been very helpful. I was also somewhat inspired by Chris's single text file approach, which in spite of the regrettable tension around the thread describing it, is actually a useful approach and mirrors yours in a few ways.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 May 2014 at 0:01 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi everyone,<br><br>Since June 1 I have used a different system than described above, have been very successful and thought I would share. It is primarily Michael Linnenberger's MYN system using Outlook (described here: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.michaellinenberger.com/1MTDvsMYN.html)">http://www.michaellinenberger.com/1MTDvsMYN.html)</a> with elements of MF's tools and my system described in the above posts. Here's how I roll:<br><br>1) Everything in Outlook. This has been working really well for me. I made a custom task form and lots of custom views, but primarily I use the to do bar as outlined by Linnenberger. I am happy to discuss this further if anyone is interested.<br><br>2) I prioritize ruthlessly, keeping the high priority list short and using it as my hotlist. I tend to randomize the list.<br><br>3) All incoming work gets a start date of today and a normal priority unless it clearly belongs on the hotlist.. After the hotlist is completed, I go through and review this list. If it is not something I must do this week it goes to low priority with a start date of next Monday. (See 6 below) <br><br>4) I then use FV on this list at least one time. Then randomize the rest.<br><br>5) I then go through the rest of the normal priority list AF style by start date. But before I move to the next day (nothing stands out) I move the remaining tasks to low priority with a start date of next Monday. (See 6)<br><br>6) Every Monday I go through the low priority stuff, if I need to work on it this week, it goes to normal or high priority. If it is quick to do , I just do it, and otherwise I defer it again for another week. I have about 200 items I am carrying from week to week. It takes me about a half hour to go through them and nothing is falling through the cracks.<br><br>7) I keep a project list in Outlook tasks, giving them a start date of 2/2/22 to keep them out of my action list and available to review. I try to review them once a week. <br><br>8) If a task has a deadline I created a user-defined filed called deadline, per Linnenberger i do not use due date.<br><br>And that's about it. This has been working well for me and I am happy to engage on any questions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 July 2014 at 18:15 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Vegheadjones<br>It's great to hear about your successes!<br>I'm glad that your fining tuning and adjustments are working so well for you.  I also respect Linenberger's principles and system(s). I don't use his outlook format.  Instead, I pinched AndreasE's DSAF format. I don't cross out previous weeks.  I simply pare it down. (I pinched that idea also but, alas, I don't remember who posted the idea.) I date each page but I still construct a basic weekly map as my primary guide for my work and other obligations.  <br><br>I've sort of kept to the ideas that you taught me about integrating yesterday's page with the MIT's once in awhile rather than my usual weakness of focusing mostly on my MITs and not always keeping the littler stuff current.  Plus your tip about going through the general list once in awhile also helps me.  I'm still weak when it comes to tying up the loose ends once the work is done. (i.e. filing, collating notes, email, etc.) but your tips have helped me to be a bit more conscientious about doing the one offs and background admin duties.  Thanks for helping me to get a bit better at that.<br><br>Between your tips and AndreasE's tips, my modified DIT has improved.  I'm truly grateful for that.  Unfortunately, I'll probably always have to work on that weakness.  I like getting my MITs done and sometimes the hyperfocus makes me ignore the admin stuff.  I'll never be an inbox zero kind of person. LOL!<br><br>It seems as though we share certain principles even though our methodology might differ.  The main difference is that I do create fake deadlines to make sure that the admin stuff gets done enough to be current.  Otherwise, I'd probably get a backlog. LOL!  (I definitely don't want that to ever happen!) Also, as an example, my knowing that the finances will be done each week by Friday gives me flexibility to zero in on projects without having the nag factor.  I have several fake deadlines for that sort of stuff. I also make fake deadlines to serve as milestones to help pace me to complete projects with or without a deadline.  I need those types of crutches to move me along especially if I need to outsmart some serious resistance. *blush*<br><br>Keep us posted.  Thanks for sharing your great ideas. DIT has been really great for me.  It's been even better using some of AndreasE's and your ideas.  (AndreasE also posted about incorporating timeline/deadlines into AF.)  Thanks, guys!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2014 at 1:56 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>My modified DIT is a weekly version. That way I don't have to feel behind as long as I get my planned (and unplanned) work done within a week or so.  Daily DIT overwhelmed me. AndreasE's DSAF made it even better!  He closes last week and keeps this week open.  That way I can take care of this week and tie up most of last week without feeling at all behind. Thanks again, AndreasE!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2014 at 2:40 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Learning, maybe that important admin stuff that keeps slipping while you hyperfocus on the MITs should take a turn as an MIT.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2014 at 1:49 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Cricket<br>LOL!  I catch it before it reaches that status by giving myself fake deadlines. I only wish I had more initiative to do it without needing the fake deadlines. I'd feel sort of ashamed if that sort of stuff reached such a state which required me to prioritize it as an MIT!
