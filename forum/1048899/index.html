As others have mentioned before, if you have a personal inquiry for Mark, become Facebook friends or email him, etc.  He's told us all he is retired, and not responded to similar threads like this you have started.  Since he has told us he is retired, I'm remaining under the impression he hasn't anything noteworthy to say or update us on until we hear otherwise.  This board becomes a joke when it turns into a board used to constantly query Mark's well-being or activities.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2010 at 19:23 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, TK.

The Autofocus landing page is very confusing, and AF4 is not clearly called out, given that it's possibly the most robust of the four versions.  Do away with AF2 and Reverse AF (AF3).  Leave AF1 and AF4 as two variations on a theme.<br><br>I was never thrilled with DWM too much, and it doesn't seem like it's fully baked.  I expected Mark to come back after the one month to validate if the system worked as he expected.<br><br>If Mark's going to ride off into retirement, better tidy up the shop first.

And though I do not agree that DWM is not fully baked (it works well for me overall), I also got the impression we were "beta-testing" it and that Mark would revise append or dismiss based on our collective experience of using it. <br><br>And I agree with David that this forum is poorer without Mark's comments. One thing that Forum Coward did not mention is that (as far as I can recall) every time David has done a post like this, Mark has responded.

I wonder if this reaction affects your relationship with people and tasks at work.  Could this be a part of your time management issues?  Please take this in the positive spirtit it is meant.<br><br>Let me make a wider point here.  The quest for the perfect time management system is largely pointless because we are looking for the solution in the wrong place.  When we fail to deliver I suggest that what's really going on is either:<br><br>- we have too much to do and have a problem asking for more time or saying no; or<br>- we are experiencing anxiety and engaging in avoidance by not engaging effectively with our work<br><br>Rather than look for the new system (an excellent avoidance activity) a more useful activity would be to get some coaching or counselling on the underlying problem.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 March 2010 at 0:57 | Man of Kent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Man of Kent, I wouldn't categorize the response he got to this post as criticism but rather as a personal attack. I don't understand why several of you feel called to lay into him when he didn't write anything unkind. In fact, as Jacqueline said, it was just the opposite. I'm just a shrink, but it seems to me that several posters had a hankering for a whipping boy and David fit the bill. I am more interested in that dynamic than in why David gets upset by being flamed for an innocuous post.

He has retired; this for me explains why he doesn't post regularly.  I am grateful that he provides this site at his own expense and without the desire to sell something.  The questions may well be motivated by genuine concern, however for me the questions are impertinent because they imply Mark should be posting.  Further constantly asking someone of Mark's age if they are OK carries the implication that they are not perhaps due to illness which again seems rather insulting and is frankly none of our business.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 March 2010 at 4:00 | Man of Kent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline:<br><br>&lt;&lt;Perhaps this is just a social experiment to see if the forum degenerates to the lowest common denominator without direct moderation.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Isn't this what you are arguing for?
