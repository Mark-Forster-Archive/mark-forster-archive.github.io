I thought about using Things, RTM, Toodledo, or ToDo and tagging the tasks, but that seems too complicated. A better option is Magicpad which is a Notes app ($1.99) for the IPhone that allows you to copy and paste, strike out and color text. I like it, but for quick entry of tasks, it isn't great. Plus, there isn't a desktop or online application to sync with. I think I've found the best option (for me at least!). It's www.tadalist.com. It's free and it has an IPhone web app. This has the disad of not working without internet access and being a bit slow away from wi-fi, BUT it's easy and works beautifully with this system. Create lists called Page 1, Page 2, etc. Unfortunately, they are ordered from most recent to oldest. You can easily see how many items are in your list so you can keep it to your prescribed number. When they're completed, they're crossed off and put at the bottom of the list. That may or may not suit you. There's no real way to highlist dismissed tasks, but I realized I can simply add an @ sign before each dismissed task or use another notation. Finally, when a page is no longer active, you can simply change the Page name to "Page 1 - inactive."  When you look at your lists, you'll see the most recent active page. It's FREE! And you can email lists, too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2009 at 5:01 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel,<br><br>I'm also an iPhone addict and do most of my reading, writing and processing on computer or iPhone rather than paper.<br><br>I'm intrigued by your system. However, like Mark Forster, I still prefer paper lists. For now I'm trying paper first. For me, paper is faster to write and easier to read and annotate. It's messier too but that seems to matter less for AF lists which are ephemeral. <br><br>However it's more difficult to write in a notebook on the move. As a hybrid paper/iPhone approach I'm using Erica Sadun's 'To Do' iPhone application to capture items on the move which I can easily do one handed while walking (e.g. while changing trains). These then get added to the AF list at some convenient point later (e.g. when I've sat down on the next train). In GTD terms it's another collection device.<br><br>I don't care about syncing to the desktop as they end up on paper anyway. None of this uses the iPhone's data access features so could be done with an iPod Touch which is much cheaper.<br><br>I keep 'To Do' on the task bar for easy access along with phone, text and mail. I haven't done an extensive survey but the things I like about it are:<br><br>Nice large font.  Items are only in here temporarily so I won't have many of them.<br><br>No spelling correction which means I can use abbreviations or shorthand without worry about them being changed. Spelling mistakes usually don't matter anyway.<br><br>A nice loud red number overlay showing how many items there are in the list.<br><br>Items can be added in a minimal number of clicks<br><br>Items can be easily deleted one at a time or en masse (though a delete all would be useful).<br><br>It's very simple and I don't forget how to use it when I haven't used it for a while<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 13:41 | Mike C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi all iPhone and iPod touch enthusiasts,<br><br>Even though I'm personally using paper for now, as a professional software developer I would be very interested to hear what people would want from iPhone application dedicated to maintaining an autofocus list.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Mike<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 14:04 | Mike C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi, Mike. I'm on day 3 of AF using Tadalist and I love it. I don't mind paper, but it bothers me that I can't have it on my person at all times. When a task comes to mind, I have to run to where my notebook is to write it down. I've usually forgotten by the time I get there! And copying items to my list later seems tedious. I just add items to my last list via IPhone. Very fast and no re-writing. Unlike paper, I can clearly see the number of outstanding items on all my lists on www.tadalist.com. Then inside each list, I see only the undone items on top. This is much easier on my eyes than searching through a paper list with lots of crossed off items. Re-entering repeating items in the list is so simple online as the computer suggests the task as you begin to type. On my Mac, I keep my Tadalist on my bookmark's toolbar, so I can access it quickly as I complete tasks. I really love it and don't think you have to be an IPhone user to enjoy using Tadalist. If you work with an Internet-connected computer or mobile device throughout the day, it's worth checking out! Just so you know, I'm not affiliated with them in any way! :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 15:00 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Mel, I'll take a look at Tadalist.<br><br>Mike</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 16:24 | Mike C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi,<br><br>I apologise is this comes across like spam. We have very recently released a new todo list app for iPhone. In which we added a feedback option. One of users has just brought this site and DIT to our attention as apparently our app is very suitable for it. Personally, I'd not heard about Mark Forster or DIT but it's certainly something I'll look into how.<br><br>Here is the users feedback:<br>"I've been using Dunnit not even a day and some stuff are just great! Like the repeating tasks... Time saver.<br><br>It actually works really well with Mark Forsters time managment technique called "Do It Tomorrow". You should really check it out. He's got a huge following and if you post on their forum about Dunnit, you could get many more clients.<br><br>It's like the second most popular tehnique to GTD (which I don't really like anymore)."<br><br>I don't know if this will be useful or not. I can say that our app is very good and has been getting good reviews. Whether it works for DIT or not remains to be seen.<br><br>You can find out more at:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dunnitapp.com">http://www.dunnitapp.com</a><br><br>Thanks for your time.<br>Daniel Wood</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 March 2010 at 20:59 | Daniel Wood</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Daniel. I really like it so far. I am thrilled that I can copy all my tasks from another app so easily. I am most excited about the game aspect of the app. We have discussed that here quite a bit. I posted to the support website that you need the option of having more default due dates like tomorrow, next week, and next month.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 March 2010 at 1:15 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It was me who sent that e-mail yesterday, wow, you guys surely take feedback response seriously! Was about to write about Dunnit myself, but now I don't have to.<br><br>I can really recommend it! It takes DIT and makes it even more powerful. Stopped using moleskin, since the iPhone is always around.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 March 2010 at 9:11 | Mattias</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Mel - We saw your post and it's something that's being worked on already and should be in the next release.<br><br>@Mattias - Please don't stop on our behalf. The more people that buy and use Dunnit the more we are able to add new features. It's much better when our users recommend our app as it doesn't sound like the normal marketing hype.<br><br>Glad you like it guys.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 March 2010 at 9:28 | Daniel Wood</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
