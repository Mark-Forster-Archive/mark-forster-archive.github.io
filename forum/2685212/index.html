Because I was interspersing other pages, e.g. general diary entries, project meeting notes, etc., my RealAF pages had to jump over these other pages. <br><br>About halfway through the month, I decided to reserve two-page spreads whenever I needed a new RealAF page. The flow was better, but this policy introduced another issue: there could be empty single pages that might never get used, depending on how many other things I was entering.  It actually worked out fine - I used all 48 pages. But on the new notebook, I decided to fill the RealAF spreads from the front of the book going forward, and other-topic pages from the end of the book going backward. This will naturally result in using up all the pages without any gaps. I update an index on Page 1 to keep track of what is where.<br><br>Hope this explanation makes sense!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 August 2017 at 6:56 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks alot, Ubi for the explanation<br><br>Me too, RAF works well for me.

Ripping out pages that are done.  Works pretty well when I stick to it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 August 2017 at 21:50 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Actually, "stick to it" is the issue.  The other issue is the scale of tasks.  I have my life divided into work and home, though there's also a 3rd category of "out" where I don't get anything done except that one outing.  The result is that I don't properly get through the list every day, and that is a problem for a ruleset that is based on the day.<br><br>At home, if many days I only have time for a handful of things on certain days, I get a couple entries in the book, look at a few tasks.  Then on another day, I have a full 16 hours to do stuff.  DDD on stuff from 2 days ago takes all of 30 seconds because there's hardly anything there.  This results in a very imbalanced book.  Two days after that, I'm supposed to run DDD on an enormous list that was generated on my free day.  I don't have the time to cover that, and most of that stuff wasn't given a proper amount of consideration to even act on once  before this came up.  <br><br>I remember reading here about a special exemption to combine two days because one day wasn't as productive, but if that scenario is the norm, I think the system needs a major adjustment to account for this.<br><br>At work, it's the same issue but different cause.  My core tasks (programming) are complex and take a long time to complete.  I break them down as much as is sensible, but they still take 30min to several hours to complete, and the minimal amount of effort at a moment is often 30min.  I might spontaneously add a pile of tasks one day, but I can hardly be expected to do anything on most of these within two days.  I can be expected to do something on them within 2 weeks though, and there are smaller tasks jumbled in with these bigger ones.  It's a different scale of operating.<br><br>I'm going over remedies in my mind, but it's painfully obvious that processing everything two days old isn't working.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 August 2017 at 14:32 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan, I'm facing the same problem. I'm using a separate @home and @work list, and because I have a part-time job I don't want to or can't do work-related stuff several days a week. And vice-versa for the @home list. What I'm doing now is not processing date-based but page-based. Usually I have 1 or 2 new pages a day, so I do D-D-D processing on the first page whenever my list exceeds 3 pages. So far, that seems to work reasonably well. You would need to have an estimate of the amount of tasks coming in every day to decide what your trigger for "above the line" is going to be, but with a paper record that shouldn't be a problem.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 August 2017 at 9:50 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I found the DDD list started to pile up and make the whole system unworkable. I think it's because I have irregular amounts of discretionary time every day, so the 2-day cadence didn't really work. I played around with some different ideas to break away from the day-based cadence, but didn't find anything that worked for me.<br><br>RAF feels like AF1 in many ways. So I have been revisiting AF1 and playing around with different ways to handle dismissal and urgency.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 August 2017 at 19:55 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It may be that the *best* task management system is the one that works best for the individual and their individual circumstances. What are the priorities for you? (Plural you). <br><br>For example, I need to capture detailed notes quickly, so I have built that in to my system. <br><br>I think it is about having an array of other helpful systems. I would be sunk for example without my paper and electronic A-Z filing systems and our menu whiteboard in the kitchen! What I am trying to convey here is designing the system to fit the user and not the othrr eay round, if that makes sense.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 August 2017 at 9:59 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon,<br><br>What is this "electronic A-Z filing system" you write about above?  I organize my computer stuff generally by project or topic, then search for things using OS-provided tools (mdfind on macOS, locate on Linux, find &amp; grep on either when searching a particular hierarchy). I use a general-reference A-Z scheme for my paper documents, but cannot fathom how this might be done electronically.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 August 2017 at 21:43 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ubi:<br><br>Leon likely has his own method, but I saw the following on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSnpAnhV2Jo . Start at 1:40 or thereabouts to skip the throat-clearing. It's pitched at a novice user level but it's useful to see the pictures.<br><br>BTW, I also have installed in my browser a video speed extension that lets me speed up replay in increments. So for the slow-talker on this video I would speed up the replay to 2x so I can 'skim' his video for the stuff I really want :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 August 2017 at 0:05 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi, I have folders within my outlook accounts by topic and they are organised alphabetically.

The normal rule of DDD everything 2 days old was a problem because sometimes it was a tiny amount, and sometimes was a huge amount, and didn't reflect the amount of time I had to devote.<br><br>Instead, I now DDD exactly 1 page.  I run this process only if the page is more than 3 pages back, and I only tackle 1 page at a time before resuming normal operations.  You could choose a number different from 3.  For context, I run 2 columns on a page, 50 items.  Following this rule, I rarely have even 10 items to tackle on the page so it's quick.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 September 2017 at 2:07 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>&lt;&lt; sometimes it was a tiny amount, and sometimes was a huge amount, and didn't reflect the amount of time I had to devote &gt;&gt;<br><br>But isn't this what the DEFER part of DDD is there for?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2017 at 11:39 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't believe so, because the amount of time I have varies day to day and is irregular.  Deferring after 2 days would at times force me to commit a large number of tasks outside of the system to be dealt with later, and that outside-the-system is not effectively managed as much as inside the system.  <br><br>This simple adjustment allows my natural variance in available time to even out over time such that very little requires deferring.  It's much cleaner.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2017 at 14:32 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; I don't believe so, because the amount of time I have varies day to day and is irregular. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Time available isn't the only variable. There's also variation in the level of incoming work.<br><br>I'm interested to know how effective you've found your tweak to be in handling that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2017 at 18:59 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan - It doesn't feel like your tweak would work for me, but we may have a big difference in the number of tasks added per day.<br><br>The average for me has been 17/day the last three weeks. How about you?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2017 at 19:03 | Zane</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I misread Alan's post when I first saw it.  I thought he was putting a cap on the number of pages, rather than the number of days.  For example, allowing no more than three active pages, and using DDD on anything earlier than that.  (Three is arbitrary -- use whatever makes sense for your rhythm of work, trying to target something like RAF's two days' worth.)<br><br>This would prevent the backlog from growing if Alan happens to have more than 1 incoming page of tasks per day on average.  And it seems like it would handle the variable flow of incoming tasks and discretionary time pretty well.<br><br>This reminds me of the time-management system that I see most often in the wild:  Stay current, and if you get behind, put in an hour or two of focused effort to get caught up and clear out all the old stuff.  I know a lot of people who manage their email like this (including me).  Seems simple and effective.<br><br>Mark, what do you think of this alternative?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 September 2017 at 2:28 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I misread Alan's post when I first saw it.

I normally clear my in-trays every day but if I don't succeed in doing that for any reason anything left over goes into the relevant backlog. So the next day I have two tasks, e.g. Email and Email Backlog. One of these is an open list and the other is a closed list. I find the closed list Backlog usually disappears pretty quickly the next day.<br><br>Note that this only works as as a way of evening out time/work spikes.

If you use context's perspective the last item is at the beginning of the list by context. So you can use GTD and Real AF all together.
