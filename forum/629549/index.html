That way one's mind will be actively engaged with all the tasks on the list. This will avoid overwhelming oneself right at the beginning.<br><br>2) I also want to address the problem of urgent items better since it has been causing concern. The instructions will contain a positive recommendation to treat items as exceptions if they are, or become, too urgent to wait to be actioned in the normal course of events. Once such a task has been completed, one should return to where one was before making the exception.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 January 2009 at 13:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sounds great Mark.  Can you also add a point that "backlog" items can be entered at some point but with a recommendation that maybe only 10 or so items at any time.  Otherwise there will me a myriad of posts about what to do with backlogs.  It is the entering of backlog items (without prior evaluation) that is moving me forward on those "stuck" areas but more than about 10 items increases my resistance to the relevant page.  In fact maybe less than 10 would be better - haven't experimented below 10 :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 January 2009 at 13:33 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like that approach to handling backlogs. It appears that getting a good mix of activity types (easy/hard, small/large, old/new, simple/complex) on each page is really important to make AF work well. Backlogs (well mine anyway) can often contain difficult, messy, painful and general high-resistance stuff (that's why they never got done!).<br><br>How about suggesting that no more than 3-5 backlog items are added for every 30 new activities? This way the  backlog would seep into the system over time.<br><br>More and more I'm seeing AF as a mutli-way pipeline or engine which takes time to be filled up, and then operates as a large parallel system. Getting the early mix of inputs (fuels) balanced helps get an effective engine working.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 January 2009 at 13:57 | Jonathan in London</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I started by putting in more backlog items than "felt" comfortable when I looked at the page but their nature was becoming urgent.  What I now do (having gotten the most urgent ones into the system) is to have an item to "enter backlog items".  I believe that AF is now naturally prompting me when (and I probably just need to let it prompt me about how many).  The more I work with AF the less comfortable I now feel with tweaks and extra rules.  I know I suggested about 10 items but I wouldn't feel like making that a rule.  I have been using the odd tweak, forcing pages, tags etc here and there - which have had their place - but I am now finding that they are starting to drop away, leaving just plain old AF.  (Still like OneNote tho' &lt;grin&gt;)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 January 2009 at 14:49 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine:<br><br>I think that once one has got AF underway and has gained confidence in the system, that it's much less critical how many items you put into it. My concern was that people were transferring hundreds of items in before they'd even started and were then getting feelings of overwhelm which prevented them from doing the system properly. There have been quite a few examples of this in the forum!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 January 2009 at 15:15 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm using the same approach Christine described, for transferring items over from Toodledo.  I just have an item called "Transfer from Toodledo", and if that "stands out" when I come across it, I pull across several Toodledo tasks -- sometimes just a few, sometimes several dozen, whatever seems right at the time.  This has worked pretty well for me.<br><br>The part that slows me down is that AutoFocus finally gives me a place to write down ideas and brainstorms and odds-and-ends that pop into my mind throughout the day.  It's so liberating just to be able to write down a snippet, without the need to think up a "next action", and without the need to set a due date and context and all the other metadata fields that TM software programs need.  But this has generated so many hundreds of new items, that it sometimes feels like the system is going too slowly.  <br><br>Using longer pages (40+ items per page) does help with this.  This suggests an additional clarification/amendment.  Maybe starting out with 25-35 items is OK, as described in the original instructions, but 40-50 is even better, once you get the hang of it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 January 2009 at 17:53 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, curious as to when you intend to re-write the instructions, and also how long the beta test will last?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 January 2009 at 21:45 | Mark Crossfield</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So am I!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 January 2009 at 22:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>Have you thought of writing things that don't involve some action to be taken, somewhere else?  I use the back of my book for odd thoughts, etc.  One writer called this a "grass catcher" list ... referring to the bag on a lawnmower.  I'm not sure who it was or why he thought that was an apt metaphor, but it has stuck with me ;-)<br><br>Anyway, I write odd ideas, prices I see while shopping, etc. in the back of the book so they don't get in the way.  If they generate any actions, those go on the AF list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 January 2009 at 22:17 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim<br><br>I agree that using AF for all those thoughts etc does add lots of items and sometimes feel that sometimes "I" am going too slowly.  However I have come to the conclusion that the benefits of having it all in one place far outweigh those concerns, and am now finding that those random thoughts and ideas move quite quickly.  For example today I hit a page with several items which were random ideas for my website and so I set up a project (within my "normal" project management system) and was able to put evrything related in the correct place, so that when I work on my website then everything is to hand. That cleared a whole load of items in one fell swoop.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 January 2009 at 23:52 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, you might want to add that ideally only those tasks are put into the system which are currently actionable. <br>E.g. one might have a task "Reinvest money from life insurance", but the money from the insurance company is due in six months time. This task is currently simply not actionable (it even doesn't make sense to plan that far ahead). These type of tasks should be catered for in a tickler file or a calendar.<br>Secondly I think it make sense to keep a separate "Someday/MayBe"-list (GTD terminology) in order to avoid to much clutter within AF. Instead I have an item "Review Someday/MayBe-list" in AF.<br>Overall: My compliments for inventing such an efficient and simple system, my productivity skyrocketed since introduction (although I spend approx. 1 hour per day in this forum). Thank you very much!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2009 at 9:54 | Christian Gärtner</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To add to Christian's suggestion ... rather than have separate books for those lists, it is fairly simple to start at the end of the book making lists for special things such as: waiting for, tickler, etc.  These lists can then be reviewed first thing in the morning and if action is needed, a note put in the AF list.  <br><br>And there is no need to go nuts trying to anticipate how many pages to allocate for each list.  Just number the pages then make each list on its own page, starting from the end.  When you run out of room on a page and the previous page is occupied by another list, find the next earlier page to continue ... then make a big notation at the top of the just filled page like "---&gt; 153" meaning that this page is continued on page 153.  The whole process takes only moments.<br><br>My mantra for years has been: "I have one notebook and it is ALL in there."  Peace of mind &lt;sigh&gt; ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2009 at 10:10 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have included a project based analysis in my approach as well. If I hit a item I have a high level of resistance to it is most likely a project (More than a few actions to complete)<br><br>This is a trigger to analyses the action, so it gets crossed out and a new entry to the list gets added called "Write down why I want to do .......", that in itself is not to hard when you spend a few minutes thinking about it. Then you have the advantage of forming a objective or goal for the project. <br><br>since I use OneNote I have a Projects Section Group and a section for each project, I make a new section and just type down what the goal is and usually the first thing I need to do falls out. <br><br>I then add that to the AF list with a link back to that section at the end so when I cross it off I have the action to view to check the outcome I want, any reference material and to keep me on track with out lost of extra text in my AF list. <br><br>Ill update my OneNote package over the weekend with this information and project template. So those of you who have emailed me for it I will send a update email. <br><br>For those of you not familiar with OneNote goto <a rel="nofollow" href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-au/onenote/default.aspx">http://office.microsoft.com/en-au/onenote/default.aspx</a> I can not do without it these days.

Are the changes to Autofocus going to happen organically, as the beta progresses, taking in all the comments on this forum.<br><br>2. Do you plan to make amendments a number of times until you are satisfied with Autofucus?<br><br>And also,<br><br>3. How do you intend to measure the success of Autofocus amongst Beta-testers, do you plan to have an embedded survey for example on your website?<br><br>I have used the system for 2 weeks now and it has definitely improved my peformance at work and home. At the same time there are a number of 'tweaks' suggested on this forum that could improve the system, potentially.<br><br>Most of the suggested improvements are coming under the category 'common sense', which is fair enough, although when under pressure common sense doesn't always lead to common practice. So perhaps a few additional tweaks in certain areas would be beneficial.<br><br>Two areas well documented on this forum that come to mind are tasks that are urgent and context related texts.<br><br>Enjoying the beta, keep up the good work.<br><br>Mark Crossfield</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2009 at 12:26 | Mark Crossfield</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>I'm a little confused about this whole "beta" concept.  Basically Mark is writing a new book, I assume.  The idea of "beta" for information is confusing.  I see why he wants feedback, but I don't see how his updating the instructions affects any one who is on this list.  We already have suggestions to incorporate into our personal systems.  I don't really find myself waiting for any new instructions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2009 at 12:39 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike<br><br>At the top of the post Mark talks about re-writing the instructions.<br><br>From what I have read Mark isn't writing a new book (which is a pity, I love the other 3), but giving away Autofocus for free.<br><br>I love this forum and the suggestions and believe Mark is in a position to synthesize any suggested tweaks.<br><br>Just looking for clarity</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2009 at 12:45 | Mark Crossfield</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>Not writing a new book is just nutty, IMO ;-)  I really think that many people don't get information through the Internet, hard as that is to believe, and why should they be left out?  In addition, a book is a different experience.  You can open it, read it, try something, take notes, flip back and forth in an instant, it does not hang or crash, etc.  It is not quite the same experience as using search engines and forms to get information.  And, the biggest thing, this is a paper based system so it is only fitting that it should be described on paper ;-)<br><br>Yes, I think Mark could collect the tweaks and compile them into a new document.  But most of us here have already incorporated them and the updated document will not change the way we work.<br><br>I get why you might want to see it all tied up with a ribbon ... I'm a big fan of ribbons ;-)  But I noticed that after I made a flow chart of the basic system I did not bother going back and adding in the tweaks I use.  Why bother?<br><br>I guess I'm thinking that if I craved new instructions, I'd just write them for myself and save Mark a lot of headache writing them for me ;-)<br><br>Just a general comment ... I can't say how great an experience this whole thing is.  Being able to read how others are tweaking the system has really stimulated my thinking.  This idea of Marks really was first class.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2009 at 12:58 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christian wrote:<br><br>"Mark, you might want to add that ideally only those tasks are put into the system which are currently actionable."<br><br>That's a good idea, Christian.

This can then be moved from page to page so that the items on it are included when working on a page.<br><br>For example if I have two same day items, "Ring Jim" and "Finish Report X" I write them on a card. Then if the page I am currently working on has five items, the two urgent items are added so that there are seven items altogether. If both the urgent items haven't been actioned when you've finished working on this page, then the card is used in the same way with the next page. <br><br>The items on the card do not count as part of the page for the purposes of dismissing items. In other words if you go to a page and the only item done is "Ring Jim" from the card, the items on the page itself will still be dismissed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2009 at 21:08 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>The simple answer is that I don't know yet. As I've said several times with regard to AF, it favours a "bottom-up" approach to goals. So I believe the right answers will emerge as we go along. I've now posted a couple of amendments that I will be making when I re-write the instructions, which I will do when I reckon the time has come to do them. Other than that, I have no definite plans.

And although you may not feel that *you* need any new instructions, if you intend to pass the system on to other people (friends, family, colleagues, clients, bosses, etc), surely you would want to do so in a version which has been made as clear as possible and has been tested as far as possible?<br><br>As for writing a book, I may or may not do that in the future but it is not the current aim - which is to make a brief set of well-tested instructions available for as many people as possible free of charge.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2009 at 22:11 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like the index card idea.

One thing i've found works for me with urgent items is to treat the urgent items as a page in their own right.  I know there are only two or three things on it in the day, but the discipline of doing or dismissing is working well for that.  I also alternate urgent page -&gt; AF page -&gt; urgent page -&gt; AF page etc.  That way I don't have to focus exclusively on urgent items, and I don't really get to procrastinate on them either.<br><br>That said, my urgent items are generally things that need to be done today, rather than right now, and little and often through the day works quite well on them too.<br><br>My 2p worth<br>Simon C</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 10:41 | Simon C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Clay:<br><br>I'm using the index card as a bookmark - thus kiling two birds with one stone: getting the urgent stuff done AND being able to find my place in the list quickly!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 11:59 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Simon:<br><br>I'm interested to know whether the "urgent item list" works better as a separate page (as you are doing it), or as a portable list of items which is added to the page one is currently working on (as I am doing it).<br><br>I look forward to hearing from others who have tried either way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 12:06 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>What works best for me is a Post-It stuck on the cover of the book -- I usually put it on the inside cover as I take the list in and out of my pocket all day so it would otherwise come off.<br><br>It is easily seen, I know it is there, I don't have to move it around, if I really wanted to have a long description on the AF list I could point to it (by page number) or, conversely I could put expanded information on the Post-It.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 12:18 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>I'll give your way a whirl this week and report back on which way I prefer.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 14:25 | Simon C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Simon.

Whenever I finish working on one page of the main list, I work on the "bookmark" before starting the next page. This seems to work perfectly, and doesn't affect the way I deal with the main pages at all.<br><br>HOWEVER it's very important that items only go on the "bookmark" when it is really necessary for them to do so. It must only be for tasks which are so urgent that they can't wait until they would be reached in the normal course of working the list. The bookmark musn't be allowed to develop into some sort of rival list. It shouldn't have more than three or four items on it at any one time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 16:07 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The idea that has been most helpful is the concept of the "page as structure" -- where tasks, in a sense, compete with one another for your attention through the intuitive and rationale scans. I hope that is more strongly emphasized in your revision.<br><br>Also the ideas of "moving to the next page" and "dismissing items". Initially, I was very unclear on these 2 rules and conversations through the discussion group have helped. Move to next page when you can't find anything more to complete on that page in a given day. Dismiss/highlight items on a page if you don't do *any* first time through in a given day. Since there are things I don't want to dismiss, my energy shifts them and I do them.<br><br>It may be obvious, but the assumption underlying all of these rules is is the* idea of the day* as the defining period in which you interact with the lists. <br><br>For someone like me with unstructured time, my mental model of my day was different, mornings academic work, afternoons home. It proved to be harder to work with the lists (and the day ended up not really being that well defined due to interruptions.)<br><br>When I shifted to 2 lists, the mental model of my day shifted and became more fluid. What structures my day now is the lists, not time. That was a major breakthrough and I have became incredibly more productive and less stressed re: time spent on projects.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 19:53 | rani</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Love your comment "What structures my day now is the lists, not time".

I use the smallest Post-It possible so I'm constrained to just a few items.  It reminds me of an old story by Jim Rohn.  The salesman was asked "How many calls did you make today?  Write the number in this little box."  Salesman starts with "Well, you know the economy...."  The boss says: "The reason I made the box so small was so that a story won't fit."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 January 2009 at 3:39 | slothbear</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am using digital lists  and I am using a digital calendar for my index card / bookmark. I enter the must-do-today task into my calendar as an event with no time. I've also used an actual index card for same-day tasks with my digital lists and that seems to work fine, too. <br><br>Mark, what I have learned about integrating the same-day urgent tasks into the AF lists is that it helps to dramatically decrease that obligation-based procrastination. In other words, if I know I HAVE to do said tasks today, I automatically don't want to. Giving myself the option of choosing a task from my must-do today list vs. a task from my AF page that I'm on eliminates that perceived obligation and I find I am happily completing these urgent tasks. Because of this, I would strongly suggest avoiding a "You must complete your must-do list before working on your AF list" rule. I know the AF lists can be used as a reward, but I think that we die-hard procrastinators will choose to engage in some mindless web surfing unless we feel we have the choice. More rules leads to more rebellion. :-) <br><br>By the way, I am finding this whole experiment as fascinating as it is helpful.

I think I may try incorporating this in the following way - a little work on the current initiative on each page.  That lets me work on the current initiative little and often through the day.  That means my "bookmark" has only one item written on it - and since it is the current initiative it should always "stand out", at least until I feel I've done enough on it for the day (then it gets crossed off the bookmark and added to the end of the regular list). <br><br> I guess this means I prefer your way to mine - but will limit the bookmark to only one item - the Current Initiative.

When something new and urgent comes in, I'm always tempted to drop everything to do it (following the 'common sense' rule). But I've found it much better to make sure even then that I write it down at the end of my list. This gives me a bit of a buffer, so I'm not being too reactive. I've also found it encourages the 'little and often' approach even with urgent items. So, for example, I could get an email with some urgent questions, and some requiring further analysis. Without writing this as a definite task, e.g. 'respond to email' this kind of thing can throw me off for hours. So I write 'respond to email', I then have a buffer to decide that yes, it is urgent, then I respond to the really urgent questions. Then I can cross off the task, re-write it immediately below, and then decide the remaining analysis is not so urgent, and return to where I was before the interruption.<br><br>2. Relating to picking up after interruptions, I used to try to go back to what I was doing before the interruption. Lately I've found it much more efficient to cross off the task I was on when I was interrupted, re-write it at the end of the list, and go back to continue the page I was on, rather than the specific item. I found that if I didn't do this, and I had a lot of interruptions, I'd end up going back to the same item time and again, and so lose the sense of moving through the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 January 2009 at 23:18 | Ed C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's really helpful Ed, sometimes I find myself going back to the same item a few times if I get interruptions in a row, but as that has not been frequent enough to cause a problem had not considered doing anything about it!
