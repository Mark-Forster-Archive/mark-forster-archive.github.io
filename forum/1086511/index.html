I have OCCASIONALLY filled all of those and when I have I've snuck tasks in on the right side of the shorter lines.<br><br>I think that to start messing with relative W and relative M is to defeat the power of DWM, which is to force movement on tasks within a reasonable timeframe and then keep them moving forward.  If you had a creative burst, great, but are you really going to work on all of those things within the next month?  Or would they be better put in a tickler/calendar?  I do use my list as a dump, and acting on a task CAN BE realizing that it's not reasonable to think I'm going to do it in the next month and transferring it to the calendar.<br><br>(I confess that I do occasionally bypass my calendar reminders and enter tasks more than a month out - for example, I have a bunch of stuff that can't be started 'til the academic semester is over already written on pages dated mid-June - but the *active* list is capped at page M.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 13:35 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I honestly don't understand how one can keep up with the full DWM system (flipping through 28 to 31 pages). I've been very happy with my modified (paper Field Notes) WM system, using 5 double-pages with four columns for each week. This mod was originally suggested by Alan B. It works great.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 15:39 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>People keep registering this objection - the flipping of the pages - and it just doesn't make sense to me.  Does it REALLY take that much effort to turn a page?  I mean, presumably the number of entries is going to be the same no matter which AF/DWM type system you're using.  You can (and I do) use paperclips to bunch pages that have no open tasks on them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 16:03 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with you Sarah, I didn't mind flipping through all the pages. <br><br>It's funny, the notebook I was using befor last week, rarely had tasks beyond the middle of the page. It was easy enough going through the book to see if the top of page had tasks or not. Because it felt like a waste  to have so much of the book blank, I just switched to a notebook using 2 pages per week (divided in 7 sections so I still had the D - W - M). <br><br>On one hand, it's 'easier' because it's only 4 pages instead of 28 (really 14 pages, since front/back of a page are 2 dates).<br><br>On the other hand, it's (fractionally) slower because I can't just check the top of the page, I have to look at the entire page. Granted, I doubt that means even a 2 second check per page (longer if there's open items) but it's a change from checking just the top of the page for tasks. <br><br>I haven't decided if it's just a 'learning curve' thing and in another few days it won't be noticeable anymore or not. If it is, I'll probably move back to a larger notebook at some point.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 17:20 | Lillian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sarah,<br><br>Regarding my objection to "the flipping of the pages," I did try the canonical DWM method for a while, and had many pages with very few items on each. I think this type of system *requires* that one cycle through all the active pages at least a couple times per day, and I found it cumbersome with so many mostly-empty pages. My modified two-facing-pages-per-week system is great - I quickly glance at each of the five double-pages, and find that I can keep a mental map of what is where throughout the day. It's so clear that I often just jump directly to the next task that "stands out" without having to cycle through each item on each page.<br><br>I do augment the system in one other way: each morning, I pick out three items that I really want to get done, and put a little circle to the left of each one, then copy those three to an index card labeled with today's date. This way, I know I'm getting a few important (or about-to-expire) tasks done each day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2010 at 21:01 | ubi</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
