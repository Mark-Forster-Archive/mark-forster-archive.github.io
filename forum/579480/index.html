You'll still waste space when the first of the sections runs out of pages and you have to switch to a new notebook, but not as much as if you had four fixed sections.<br>Your method also suffers from a problem we discussed here: How to schedule tasks or reminders in the future. <br><br>Another question: Where can one find the other ebook, 'Desired Outcomes Implementation Technology'? It's mentioned in the SGTM ebook, but I can't find it on your site. <br><br>Sorry for hijacking the thread.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 October 2008 at 13:22 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If I right click on the link and download it from the pop-up menu I get a .php file which nothing on my computer will open.<br><br>If I left click on the link a .zip file opens which I can then download and it unzips to reveal a .pdf file. <br><br>So I've finally got the document, but it's not easy to do!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 October 2008 at 15:38 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I found that it worked very easily when I left clicked on the link then instead of clicking on save I clicked on open.

I have to say that I'm not really impressed by the author's thinking, esp. after I had a look at the linked “live in your calendar” post. <br><br>Gerry's idea to structure your day's tasks into personal/work tasks on one side and before/after lunch on the other looks interesting to me. <br><br>It's like subdividing the daily perspective of the DIT principles (or the Task Diary) into a 2x2 matrix (more precisely, it's a linear time scale with 5 distinct periods, but for modeling, that won't matter). <br><br>Mark, <br>what do you think of that system? <br><br>I write this from the perspective of someone who is neither self-employed nor a CEO type of  person, and - unfortunately - most time management system seem to be geared towards those two groups. <br>I must say that I keep having a hard time to adapt the DIT principles to my real world, where I have little control over my schedule, interruptions, or the expectations of immediate reactions. (Yes, I wanted to make this the subject of a new forum post, but ironically I don't get around to it.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2008 at 1:17 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alex:<br><br>What do I think of that system?<br><br>I have to confess that I have never seen any need for any of these complications.<br><br>With DIT there is no need to plan your day, no need to prioritise, no need to time anything. You just have a list of stuff to do and get on with doing it. If you have meetings and interruptions, then you just carry on with the list once the meeting or interruption is over.<br><br>DIT also allows you to make sure that your work is in balance, but insisting that one day's incoming work must equal one day's outgoing work on average.<br><br>So why all the complication? <br><br>I just write down everything that comes in during the day for tomorrow and then do it tomorrow. <br><br>If it really has to be done today, then I do it today. <br><br>If I don't get through the list tomorrow then I carry it forward, but with the proviso that I must catch up within 4 days or so. <br><br>If I can't catch up then I must look at why I can't and do something about it.<br><br>What's so difficult about that?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2008 at 11:02 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I tend to agree with what you are saying here Mark. In fact I sometimes wonder if constantly fiddling with time management systems is another sophisticated way of procrastination (speaking from personal experience). Of course it is good to experiment and try to improve things if they are not working for you, but in my view a time management system that is more complicated to run just tends to slow productivity down. Not that I mean to critiicize any body else's ideas, particularly as I have not reviewed them for myself on this occasion.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2008 at 13:52 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've always worked on the principle that if something doesn't work then I should find ways of simplifying it.<br><br>Making anything more complicated is usually a "work around".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2008 at 13:57 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I tend to agree with Mark. Keep it simple!<br><br>When I was working in an office environment when answering the phone and doing others' bidding was the norm, I had a simple system based around a single reporter's notebook. I would write a 'to do' list and would just keep it running - crossing out tasks as they were completed. Sometimes, to stop having to look back too many pages, I would rewrite a task later on to keep tasks bunched together over fewer pages. This meant I could work off my to do list, be interrupted and then just come back to where I'd left off. Some days I got interrupted a lot, others hardly at all. I would review things now and again (depending on how much had built up) and if some tasks were continually being left undone I would either do them, try to persuade someone else to do them (delegate/bribe), or delete them if by neglect they had become obsolete. It's amazing how even in a customer support situation like I was in, you can avoid the need to do some tasks altogether. Obviously I was careful only to do this with tasks that seemed unnecessary in the first place - if I was chased on a particular task then it would get done sooner.<br><br>With DIT then, a similar system would work but using the task diary as the default list. I would work from the list of tasks in the task diary, get interrupted, then continue on my list of tasks for that day. All the other guidelines of DIT (checking incoming work for its level of urgency, etc. and entering reminders for the future for delegated tasks, etc.) would still apply. I think this is where figuring out the basic premises of a time management system then adapting it for your own environment is so useful. No time management system is bespoke and, like a software package I used to do the support for, each person has to tweak the system to make it work for them. But, providing you still follow the basic principles then the philosophy behind the system should remain pretty much intact - which is presumably what appealed in the first place.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2008 at 14:05 | Hannah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh, one more thing.<br><br>In say a customer support role, or any other role that involves constant interruption from the phone or other people, then many of the tasks that are 'incoming' work are treated as same day immediate. That's just the nature of the beast. It is only other tasks that are not ones that you would instantly react to that would end up in the task diary (in my opinion - I know Mark says to write every task down but I would think that answering the phone is an exception since in a support role you wouldn't want to be deciding 'yes, this is same day immediate' and entering it into the task diary prior to every call). However, any tasks resulting from that call would need to be assessed as per standard DIT to avoid doing things immediately just out of habit.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2008 at 14:15 | Hannah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One more thing! Last for now honest...<br><br>I think the main criteria for any time management system is does it help you get done what you want to get done or does it hinder you. If the former, great - go ahead and use it; if the latter - chuck it out and get a new system!<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2008 at 14:19 | Hannah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hannah:<br><br>In DIT "same day" and "immediate" are not the same thing. "Immediate" is defined as being so urgent that you drop everything else in order to deal with it. <br><br>The example you give of answering the telephone is an example of an "immediate" action. You wouldn't normally write an immediate action down in your Task Diary because you would be too busy doing it.<br><br>However any action coming out of the phone call would not be "immediate" (unless it was an emergency). It would either be "same day or "everything else". In that case you would write it down and be forced to chose between writing it on today's page or tomorrow's).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2008 at 15:52 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It almost looks like I hit a nerve here (maybe I shouldn't have used words like 'matrix' and 'modeling'). <br><br>What I meant was that I liked: <br><br>(a) The thought of separating work and personal actions. DIT is basically about work (only), but with the examples coming from the world of a self-employed person, the lines tend to be blurry, which confuses me a little - GTD has a similar tendency to mix work and private life. To be fair, the basic metaphor of the repair shop is a good, work-centric one and I might be messing things up with some stuff from GED, not DIT. <br><br>(b) The before/after lunch time separator for work. This enables you to use a buffer of 1/2 a day instead of a day. This could be much more in line with the nature of *my* work, where I can rarely let open tasks linger for a whole day, due to a very tight schedule (I probably should have written my planned post, that would have made it much clearer). I'm not into advocating scheduling your tasks (though it is imposed on me quite a lot, unfortunately). I wouldn't really call this 'complicating' things.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2008 at 21:26 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My intent in separating the day into the sections was to solve the problem some of us find ourselves in whom are not self employed.   It allows you a place to put the things you need and want to do into time you control.  It is almost akin to the “unschedule” idea.  By seeing that you have time for yourself and what you want to accomplish in life, you do not feel so overwhelmed by your responsibilities at work.  If was self employed and “owned” my whole day, I would not need it.  <br><br>My attempt at designing the system was to be as simple as possible while adding a few ideas that I thought were worthwhile enhancements.  Part of the design is due to my personal situation, i.e. employed, supervising others, with lots of projects and an ok memory.  So these features are the minimum I need.  Other may need less.  <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 October 2008 at 4:54 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alex:<br><br>Well, you did ask me what I thought of the systems so I told you!<br><br>On the employment/personal divide, my advice has always been to have a separate Will Do list for each location. It really doesn't matter whether a task is personal or employment related - it's WHERE you do it that counts (I think GED says the same).<br><br>However one should I think distinguish between personal chores (paying the bills, mowing the lawn, getting the car repaired) and leisure activities (writing to friends, watching a DVD). I think leisure activities should only be minimally scheduled - they are supposed to be relaxing after all!<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 October 2008 at 14:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry:<br><br>My intent wasn't to criticise you methods so much as to extol the benefits of DIT's ultra-simple approach. I think the remarks I made about location in my previous answer to Alex apply to what you say as well.<br><br>It's interesting what you say about self-employed people "owning" the whole day. Actually that's what people tend to think *before* they become self-employed. When they do become self employed, it comes as a rude shock to find that they spend the whole day at the beck and call of clients and have no boundaries to mark the beginning and end of the working day in the way which people who travel to work have.<br><br>Of course there are many advantages in being self-employed or working from home, but they tend not to be the ones that first spring to mind.<br><br>And finally, I've been intending to write my blog posting about "Keep It Complicated, Stupid" for ages. It's not directly related to this discussion.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 October 2008 at 14:15 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, <br><br>sorry, I really don't want to introduce any unpleasentness here.<br><br>The employment/personal divide isn't a huge problem (even though from my experience, the same planning horizon - i.e. daily vs. weekly - often doesnt seem to fit both well at the same time). IMO it doesn't really matter whether you use 'contexts' (the GTD criteria) or a simple 'work'/'personal' divide (I usually find this more practical than over-atomized 'contexts') or a time-based divide (as in Gerry's example) to separate work from your personal tasks (I didn't mean leisure activities). But the time-based separation seems to play nicely with the core DIT concept of 'limits'. <br><br>What about using a half-day buffer instead of a whole-day one?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 October 2008 at 2:19 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>I do not view anything you said as critical.  I have successfully used DIT after GTD and had success with it. To me employed means a more limited ability to control your agenda.<br><br> I wrote my little ebook to try to put my thoughts out there for a system that would incorporate some of DIT GTD and my own thoughts on time management.  I have a full time job in another field and so I thought I would just give it away to see if some people connected with it.

Another alternative I once advised to someone in unusual circumstances was to keep a one-day buffer but to start the day at 12 noon instead of 12 midnight.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 October 2008 at 12:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>I'm the author of the original post "Why a to-do list doesn't work" (from the Evolving Excellence blog), and have very much enjoyed following this discussion. Your concept of the closed list is intriguing: I like the simplicity of the system and the way it doesn't require the user to constantly shift around the inevitable broken appointments for his own work.  There's real elegance in that simplicity.<br><br>As you suggest in your comments, I do advocate leaving plenty of time for interruptions: scheduling one's day completely full is a recipe for certain failure and frustration.  <br><br>That said, I think there are three real benefits from scheduling time in the calendar.  First, blocking out the time in the calendar prevents other people from scheduling you for other activities.  (Nature abhors a vacuum -- and an empty calendar.)  Second, using the calendar forces you to really consider how long an activity will take.  Finally, just as making a commitment to doing something on a specific *day* helps ensure that it will get done, choosing a specific *time* is similarly powerful in promoting action. <br><br>Thank you for the thought-provoking ideas.

Feel great to be a part of the community. <br> Wanted to share a website which might be very use full for some of the people here.<br> I was doing some research on my mortgage refinance issue when I came across this website. <br> It lists some 21 mortgage calculators that I did not see anywhere on the internet so I was compelled to<br>  share it.  The coolest thing was that it also gives you the findings in plain English as well so you can <br>understand the results of your findings easily.  The website can be accessed here. &lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" href="http://1mortgagecalculator.info>Mortgage">http://1mortgagecalculator.info&gt;Mortgage</a> Calculators&lt;/a&gt;<br><br><br>Thanks</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2009 at 7:07 | Extegetor</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
