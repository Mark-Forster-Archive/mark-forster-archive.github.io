It's a FANTASTIC book!!<br><br>However, I'm having a hard time trying to juxtapose DIT and AutoFocus.  After reading DIT and hearing Mr. Forster expound on the merits of closed lists (versus open lists), it seems like he is contradicting himself by releasing the AutoFocus method, which is essentially one giant open list.  If I have a gigantic monolithic list from which to work from, how do I know that I have done everything I have planned to do today?<br><br>Maybe I'm missing something, but the two systems appear contradictory at first glance, and I'm more inclined to trust DIT so far.  What am I erring on?<br><br>Thanks!<br>  -John</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 5:03 | JohnDec</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi John<br><br>You are absolutely right in that DIT is an excellent system and prior to AutoFocus was far and away the best system I had seen for time management.  It addressed issues not found in other systems and provided a practical way of dealing with "the day's workload".  However the two systems are very different but you are wrong when you say that AF is an open list.  It is in no way an open list but rather a series of "closed" lists and it is by using the system according to the rules that it works.<br><br>A To Do list, or a "Will Do" list or the daily list produced under the DIT method, imposes a set of tasks which are required to be done, not necessarily in a particular order, but have a rational obligation for completion, and within DIT a planned specified timescale. AF differs immenselely in that it imposes no time scale and no obligation.  Tasks are done "as they stand out" and ONLY when they stand out.  There is flexibility within the system to action urgent (genuinely urgent) tasks, but the strength of the system is it's ability not merely to get things done, but to identify what are the genuinely importants tasks in our lives, and to enable us to make changes to the way we do things, or even the things we are doing.<br><br>No other system comes close although I I would certainly have recommended DIT as the best system available to anyone in the past.<br><br>It is immensely difficult to explain how AF works, as it is the way in which it taps into our intuition as opposed to allowing us to impose our rationale on tasks that is it's strength.  That is by definition virtually impossible to describe.  Do give the system a try - but stick to the rules :-)  - and see how you go .......<br><br>Best of luck :-)<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 8:22 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Christine, I appreciate the reply!<br><br>Would you say then, that AF is a *replacement* for DIT?<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 8:33 | JohnDec</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>JohnDec:<br><br>I think the word I would use is an "alternative" to DIT. Christine is right that the two systems work in very different ways, and it is in my view a mistake to try to combine them. My own attempts to do so have always resulted in a reduction in effectiveness.<br><br>So it's best to take the one you find you get on best with and stick to that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 12:32 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>JohnDec,<br><br>DIT obviously works well for many people - and on paper it probably looks great to you (because Mark is a good writer), heck, GTD looked great to me in theory and so did Franklin Planner and so did Alan Lakein's A, B, C, D recommendation.  It all comes down to whether you can stick with the system or not and if it works for you to get done what you need to get done.  <br><br>DIT wouldn't have been a fast enough method for me to get to things that I feel are essential to get done right away, and would have resulted in my getting some things done that weren't important to do.  I can get to those essential things quickly now with AF but to get to that point, I had to work with AF for a couple of months and see how *I* was letting the system down.  It worked fine, I just wasn't dismissing quickly enough and I wasn't putting on the list enough of the things that were a priority for me.  <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 14:01 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thank you Mark, Jacqueline and everyone else!

Would this still be considered a combination system to stay away from?<br><br>Best,<br>  -John<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 16:35 | JohnDec</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi John<br><br>I loved DIT when I found it but could not stick to it well enough enough - my propensity for procrastination won out over the system :-)  Jacqueline hits the nail on the head when she says "It all comes down to whether you can stick with the system or not and if it works for you to get done what you need to get done."  For me AF deals with the issues that have never allowed me to stick to any time management system easily, even systems I have created myself.  There are a lot of people who are far better able to stick to a more structured system than I am - and DIT is a fantastic product.<br><br>If you work in an environment where a more structured system is appropriate for you then you may well prefer DIT - but in my opinion AF works in all environments.  I am fortunate enough to be able to work well with the "one list for all" approach as I am home based.  Mark says above "So it's best to take the one you find you get on best with and stick to that" but I believe he is referring to trying to operate a hybrid system. If you wanted to try both systems that may well enable you to identify what suits you best but general experience is that hybrid systems reduce effectiveness.<br><br>You mention that you have only recently discovered DIT but do not say if you have tried AF or for how long.  Although AF can be started virtually instantly, it can take a while to really get used to how the system operates, so if you are inexperienced with AF you will probably want to try it without adaptation for a period of time to assess it's effectiveness fully.    <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2009 at 22:43 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just following up.  It's the end of my first day using Autofocus and the results are great so far.  Of 38 tasks, 19 tasks are done and I never thought I would get so much done in one day!  Had I gone "strict DIT" I'm not sure I would have ever allocated the 19 tasks in the first place.<br><br>I'll continue posting my progress but a hearty THANK YOU to Mark and everyone else here for the advice.<br>  -John<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2009 at 6:01 | JohnDec</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
