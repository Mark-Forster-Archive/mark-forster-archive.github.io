And awesome work Andres!  It's great to get a glimpse into how he actually works his lists, complete with real life examples.  I came across this a few years ago.  I tried it for a while but it didn't stick.  I guess I just wasn't ready for the simplicity of a long list system with one of Mark's brilliant algorithms.  <br><br>I shared the idea of the long list and simple scanning with my mom yesterday.  She was mentioning how she had so many things to do and she gets distracted all the time by random tasks as she's walking around the house.  It was great to see her write down 12 things off the top of her head "oh yeah, I need to do this....oh yeah, I also need to call...".  We'll see how it goes.  <br><br>Mark, from reading your blogs, it seems like you keep coming back often to simple scanning.  Is that the system that you are using today?  I am interested in trying AF4 again, since I'm noticing that my list is getting really long.  I have some tasks that haven't been actioned for 8 or 9 days.  I really want to get to them, but I've been working a lot of overtime, and have very limited spare time at home to work on them.  Learning how to dismiss is something I'm not too skilled at yet.  I tend to hang onto things simply because I know I want to do it, but I just haven't been able to get to it for a week or more.  <br><br>One thing that worries me with something like AF4, would be the feeling of being "trapped" in your closed list for a while, when you really need to get to something right away in your open list.  It seems that urgent items could suffer with this system when they are in the open list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 November 2018 at 2:48 | Cameron</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>« One thing that worries me with something like AF4, would be the feeling of being "trapped" in your closed list for a while, when you really need to get to something right away in your open list.

It's worked very well over the last week or so in getting a lot of work finished before a holiday deadline. So well in fact that I'm thinking of sticking with it. In spite of what it says in the article, it's important with this system that the list isn't allowed to get too long. I find 100 tasks to be the realistic upper limit.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 November 2018 at 13:15 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF4 doesn't really trap you.

So far I've really like simple scanning, with the caveat that I need to learn how to dismiss with less thought.  Are there any good recommendations for how to go about dismissing with confidence?  Is there a general rule that if something isn't worked little and often, then it should be dismissed...with "often" being every somewhere around four days maximum?  <br><br>&lt;&lt;"I tend to follow the "if it needs doing now, just do it" rule.&gt;&gt;<br><br>I like this rule.  To clarify, would you say that this is the same thing as a rule that states "you can basically skip forward to any item in your long list whenever you want to without having to scan your way there."

But, you may want to look at Mark's DWM method which is my favorite way to do dismissal. In brief:<br><br>Any newly entered task expires after 30 days, if not acted on even in part.<br>Once an item is acted on in part (WIP), you have 7 days to act some more on it, otherwise it expires.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 November 2018 at 15:28 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cameron:<br><br>&lt;&lt; To clarify, would you say that this is the same thing as a rule that states "you can basically skip forward to any item in your long list whenever you want to without having to scan your way there."

"... just do it now, without even bothering to write it down or find it on the list" &gt;&gt;<br><br>I'm finding this simplicity to be very important. <br><br>It reminds me of something I read in Theory of Constraints. It's pretty straightforward to come up with a buffering system that keeps a factory or a supply chain running really smoothly 95% of the time, requiring expediting and overriding only 5% of the time -- which is generally a huge improvement over whatever the factory / supply chain was doing previously. But trying to get to 99% or 100% requires far more effort and is just too costly. <br><br>Trying to get the rules of a time management system to handle automatically 100% of everything life throws at you is a similar problem. It's just not worth the cost. The rules become too complex. If you need to override the rules 5% of the time -- just override the rules, "do it now", etc. So what if it's not "perfect" -- it's probably still orders of magnitude better than whatever we were doing previously.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 November 2018 at 18:19 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, yes!  I think I'm coming to a better place with how to use my lists.  Use it for the bulk of my daily activities, but don't be crazy dogmatic about it.  If it just makes sense to do something now without a list for whatever reason, go ahead and do it.  <br><br>Maybe some of this misunderstanding stemmed from a line from the blog post 10 advantages of the long list:  "Every task you are thinking of doing has to be written down, put on the list and subjected to the selection procedure. This is a very effective way of avoiding impulsive activity."  It sounds like to me this has an asterisk next to it: *if you need to override the rules 5% of the time, just override the rules, like Seraphim wrote.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 November 2018 at 16:40 | Cameron</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
