It's very abstract, and quite possibly confusing to readers.  But to me it's making sense of a central puzzle in managing work.  SF tells me what to do, but not what to do with what I do/have done/am doing.  If it helps you folk, I'll be pleasantly surprised :-)<br><br>All my work goes into SF.  Much of my work creates stuff.  Stuff is created to be used.  Used byâ€¦ other work.  In order for the other work to find the stuff, it must be in a  set place, but where?<br><br>Much of the world is physical, and we understand physical organization.  Some stuff is virtual, such as this website.  It has a virtual location. So the strongest way to organize is according to the physical or virtual element it's best associated with.  Date,   place, person, thing, etc.<br><br>Delegation is to another person, a physical being.  So sometimes you might organize work by who's doing it.  However, while it may be useful to list what a person is doing, it may be more useful to have a place that work belongs.  Team work is built on having a shared (virtual) work area where each does their part to build the whole.  And the place is organized around the structure and function of what is being created.<br><br>The SF list represents you.  What you may or may not do.  It's a tool employed to enhance your decision making capacity to choose things you will do.<br><br>You choose something to do, but the doing, designing, building, filing are according to the target: For what or whom are you doing the work?  (If for yourself, to what end?)  Organize your production accordingly.  Do the work.  If it's incomplete, note in SF to complete it.  <br><br>And then be sure your creation is not abandoned useless, but gets to its useful purpose.  Who will be looking where you put your work?  If it's you, should there be a task in SF to bring you there?  If someone else, do you need to tell them?  Is there a system or circumstance that will lead them there?  If not, note in SF what you need to bring the work out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 March 2011 at 22:07 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You have GOT to be an INTJ -- or at the very least, an NT.

A sort of "next project" rather than a "next action"? If there's another way to express the "central puzzle," maybe I will get it the second time around.

Bernie I'm half talking followthrough and half about organizing info.

But I'm convinced the ideas are gold if they can be made concrete [golden concrete, heh]. <br><br>Point 1: all work has a purpose. How (and whether and when) you do the work ought to be guided by its purpose. <br>Example: wash dishes because you want dishes to eat on, because you want space on the table, counter to work, because you don't want mold. So this implies also cleaning table and counter, having convenient place to store dishes.<br>Example: write an instruction manual because some people need to know how to use X.  Therefore design the manual according to how someone should learn to use X. (and not how X was designed.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 March 2011 at 14:53 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I just assume all my work is important and has a purpose; I'll let the universe sort it out later; or at least until I get to "ponder the significance of my work" on my task list. at which point I might delete something off my list....</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 March 2011 at 15:58 | Bob Pankratz</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sure, if your job is people asking you to fix stuff, that's fine. In my case the work is all self-defined and accounting for why is useful, and for much more than just motivation or deciding whether to do something. It directly affects HOW I do the job.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 March 2011 at 17:13 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan, it strikes me your are talking about outcomes rather than tasks. To first order, anyway.<br><br>A week or so back, I read some of Erik's posts mentioning Kanban. "What's kanban?" I wondered, so I spent an unreasonable amount of time online reading about it. They took a ticket-based system made for tracking factory-line deliverables and turned it into a ticket-based system for tracking personal tasks. I liked it, sort of, but when I walked through examples, I kept thinking that it became very artificial and arbitrary when recast for tasks, particularly because a person's task board is so heterogeneous: tiny tasks, huge tasks, trivial tasks you just need to remember, save-the-world tasks, etc. Visualizing each one as a Post-It makes them look like equal blocks of value, when they are not remotely. The visual workflow metaphor was great, but to really work, you want each glance to show you where the relative values are. Their book-writing example was the only one I found compelling: each chapter is a Post-it, moving through columns labeled "pre-writing," then "proofreading," "sent to editor," etc. Deliverables in equal units of value, visualized in a workflow.<br><br>(trust me, this is all actually relevant ...)<br><br>So I thought, "Maybe these kanban people would be better off going back to *deliverables* instead of tasks." And then I pondered how often I get my next-actions wrong, even when I've spent some time planning them out (i.e., when I go to do them, I do not find them the best way to move the project forward). For this reason, when I look at my action list, I still *see* a project list, and i either confirm the action written or compute a new one on the fly, based on a new development, new idea, or adapting to the current Context.<br><br>So ... in a more intuitive system like SF, perhaps I want to de-emphasize tasks? Perhaps deliverables and outcomes are more useful to drive the list, with actions working as useful suggestions jotted alongside. Then I am essentially following a feedback loop when I glance down the list: where am I now vs. where I want to be for this outcome, and take a delta step in that direction ... like some of Mark's visioning exercises in the _Dreams_ book.<br><br>Your outcomes above might become "counter, table, and dishes cleaned and ready for next meal," and "instruction manual suitable for novices to learn X." You might even go with "Historical novel published."  ;-&gt;<br><br>There is nothing new here, of course, at all; it is straight-up GTD project planning and many other schools of thought too. But if we get tunnel vision about writing "actions," it might help to refocus at the outcome level again as you seem to be pondering.<br><br>Remember one of Mark's early how-to notes on running a project in SF? He wrote the "What's Next?" item in C2 as a generator for C1 tasks. We might formalize that by saying "write the outcome in C2 to drive task generation. Let individual tasks live wherever they need to (C1 or C2 or waiting on a project list for later), with a relatively short lifespan (small steps), and move the *outcome* forward in SF to keep the project moving.<br><br>The heart of the matter is that (1) desired outcomes change a lot less often than next-action ideas, and (2) desired outcomes are your units of value (hence motivation), whereas the tasks themselves are a means to an end.<br><br>Am I anywhere near the mark?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 March 2011 at 20:03 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very interesting Bernie. I hadn't thought in these terms but yes outcomes are valuable drivers for action.  In fact, I think writing outcomes in the list may get me nearer this thought revolution I'm pursuing here.  <br><br>I can't say if you're near the mark as I haven't located that yet ;-)<br><br>Aside, if you study Erik's take on Kanban, you'll find it's more interesting than the average personal kanban. He's normalized task sizes to one Pomodoro each, and arranged them by  type.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 March 2011 at 20:38 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
