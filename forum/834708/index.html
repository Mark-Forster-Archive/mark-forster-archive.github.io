Now with the printing option it's even easier to review. I keep completed tasks in place--rather than clearing them--in order to distiguish blocks for future dismissal. However, since the completed task is really just a place holder, when two completed tasks are adjacent, I just delete one. This also helps keep the list clear so more tasks appear on one screen.<br><br>I have adopted a (very) minor tweak which I'm very happy with: I never allow one "block" of tasks to have fewer than two tasks in it. That way every day at least 2 items are up for dismissal. So any time two single tasks are separated by a completed action, I just delete the completed action and join the single tasks into one block.<br><br>Regular interspersal of frequent, simple tasks keeps the list moving and virtually guarantees that only 2 tasks (but never less) are up for dismissal every day.<br><br>This is working very well for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 July 2009 at 17:49 | rodmitch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>VERY interesting, and tempting, even though I have tried electonic methods for AF1 and really like my Moleskine notebook (medium size, ruled, hard cover).<br><br>I've got a lot of emails and other information invested in Outlook 2007, but I also have a few gmail/googlemail email addresses.  Why?  Because I am a one-man business working abroad usually in developing countries.<br><br>BUT I am wary of switching to Google, much as i like GMail and the sound of Tasks because if the Internet is down, I'm stuffed, UNLESS Google will overcome this shortly as I think is the case.<br><br>But I'm still interested!<br><br>Roger J</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 July 2009 at 23:57 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I bit the bullet and moved my AF2 list to Google tasks. I had a few reasons to do so but the main reason was that my paper list was 30 pages long (many tasks crossed out within those pages though) and it was getting disheartening paging through all the pages each morning.<br><br>So far so good, though I feel Google tasks is in-between paper and other task managment software. It's simple, so it's easy to enter items (but not as easy as paper) but doesn't have project tagging, start dates or other functionality I am used to with task lists (I used to use toodledo).<br><br>But I like it better than 30 pages.

All my accounts get pulled into my Gmail account, but gmail is very smart in managing this. If I get an email sent to my work email (not gmail), when I reply, gmail includes the account information for my work account. Gmail's tags (called Labels) are more powerful than folders since more than one label can be applied to a message. <br><br>One of the most useful features of Gmail is its ability to thread elements of the conversation together (I know Mail.app does this), and the tags remain on new emails in the thread. This is particularly helpful for regimenting emails within projects, but more importantly, I have a "waiting" tag (colored red) applied to tasks that I delegate. Using Gmail's multiple inboxes, I have all the items listed as waiting appear below my inbox. Once the answer get emailed back to me, I see the message with the "waiting" tag sitting in my inbox. <br><br>Google Gears allows for offline use of gmail, contacts, and calendar. I haven't tested to see if the tasks are included in the offline bundle. Gears is a plugin that works with all commonly used browsers. <br><br>If you can get over the web-based email look, I think you'll really enjoy gmail.<br><br>@vegheadjones<br><br>Glad it's working well for you. Another way to get tasks - you can make a tasks dashboard widget for Mac. Open the tasks page in Safari, and use the scissors to clip it, and it will appear in the dashboard. Works very slick.

It could be anything like even just an X that you then complete as done. Then drag your task with associated note (this works with subtasks, too) to the top. This is the best workaround I've found, though most of the time for simple tasks, I simply re-type the task as I can do that quicker than copying and pasting.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 July 2009 at 19:52 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel, I was going to suggest the exact same thing - the task can keep changing.

That's certainly better than one of the lists being "magic."  Unfortunately, that only seems to work when you open Tasks from within Calendar though (which is too narrow to use all the time for me)...I currently use Tasks in Firefox's sidebar so that it's always open no matter which web page I'm on, and so that I can widen the list as necessary to reduce wrapping and make my list more readable.  However, it's not the end of the world if I have to go into Calendar's Tasks and switch the list twice per day in order to have the most-relevant due dates showing depending on whether I'm at home or at work.

You can setup a macro to streamline this process if necessary.<br><br>That's about all I could figure out.

I got a .PRN file by printing and then selecting "print to file" from the standard print options box.  I did not know that .PRN was in any way editable.  Great!<br><br>What a shame that they make us jump through so many hoops.  I mean, really, why not just allow a date selection of ALL rather than 1,5,7, and 10 (or whatever)?  And why not just a dump to text at least?  I'm getting the impression that Google does everything about half-way.<br><br>Again, thanks.  I'll look into setting up a separate Outlook profile just for this purpose and see if that works for me.

I don't plan to switch to the combo method. I keep my associated lists in Listomni and I am being very strict about dismissing subtasks. For example, I have Organize on my Google AF2 list. I have a huge list of organizing tasks in Listomni. I put the last one on this list as a subtask under Organize today. If I organize today but don't do this subtask, it gets added to the general dismissal pile. In a very short time, I should have a list of only tasks that I really want to do any time soon. Eventually I may be able to manage these associated lists as in AF2. In other words, I will dismiss blocks. But for now most of the lists are continuous blocks anyway. I DO look forward to an onboard app for working with Google tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2009 at 19:01 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>vegheadjones:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I've moved back to paper as I could not find a happy way to have separate pages in google tasks.

I left paper in 2001 when I set up a complicated context, priority, project model in Outlook. AF1 was a revelation in simplicity and worked really well on paper. I really enjoyed flipping through the closed lists.  I got a bit discouraged though using paper on AF2. I was in a hectic period at work where I kept adding (and actioning) on items at the end, but never getting to anything in the middle. I ended up with 30 pages of items which kind of freaked me out, and the single continuous backward motion of flipping was not much fun so I moved  to an electronic AF list.<br><br>But so far so good back on paper. AF2 is needed for me at my fast changing work environment, but when it is time to go to AF1 (per the switch action standing out) I can flip more leisurely again enjoying paper. I likes it!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2009 at 21:40 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As someone who is totally bereft without my PC I continue to be amazed at how easily I use AF with a paper notebook and no compulsion to be totally digital.  I do maintain a digital version in OneNote which gives some advantages but mainly because it exactly mirrors my paper notebook.

With other systems I was always trying different digital implementations of them, and never being completely satisfied with either a digital or a paper version. Since I'm using Autofocus, I've had the urge to try digital only once, and after 5 minutes of tinkering already realised that I like paper much better. There is something about crossing off a task and flipping through half-completed pages that can't be beat by a tickmark on a computer screen.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 July 2009 at 0:00 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Nicole<br><br>Absolutely!

I also have two energetic kiddos at home, so I know where Mel is coming from!<br><br>I have used Autofocus in paper form on my Moleskine for quite some time, but since so many of my tasks are initiated from email, or reference files that have been emailed to me, Google Tasks' ability to pull these emails from Gmail into the task list is necessary with how I work.<br><br>For Mark's latest Autofocus instructions, I work normally in "Reverse" as descibed, then in "Forward Mode" I work off the sidebar and use page up/down to delineate the "pages" (my firefox is always maximized in the height dimension on my screen, so there are 24-26 tasks visible at any given time).<br><br>Items up for review get indented and moved to my review list. When in review mode, I take action on or complete (delete) tasks that I know I will not work on in the future.

You won't believe this, but I've been testing paper all day. I used a notebook for the very first of AF and that's all. SO many people rave about it that I thought I should give it and the new combo method a try before I can be certain I have the best system possible. I am not using any associated lists either. I think it will be interesting! I'm using a smaller notebook that I can easily pop in my purse and carry with me. If I can't get to my notebook (FIND IT lol), I will email myself the task to add. One thing I am doing that I think is a great way to keep from dumping an old list into a new one is added the task, "Choose one task from the old list." That should prevent the constipating blocks from settling into the new list. ;-) <br><br>But as I sit here pallet, I can see my Google tasks list and oooh I love it.

I know there was at least one person using it, however. It didn't seem like it was a good fit for AF2 at all. Google tasks offers the sync and integration that RTM has, but is very very simple. There are no location aware tasks (which I personally think is major overkill), for example. There are no repeating tasks, no tags, etc. It's just beautifully simplistic for AF, however.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2009 at 3:43 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I love Evernote.
