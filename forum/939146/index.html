That idea has always rubbed me the wrong way because even though I might not actually take physical action on items on my "home list", I can think about them and do planning almost anywhere.  In addition, some items on my list often require ONLY thought actions.  So ...<br><br>I've got a trip coming up over the long Thanksgiving week my wife has off.  We are going to visit her folks and she is going to take a weekend conducting workshop.  So I'm going to try a hybrid of Mark's dual book idea.  I plan to draw a line at the end of my active list ... a TEMPORARY line (maybe I'll actually use a different color).  Then, when on the road, I'll treat that portion of the list (from the line to the end) as a single OPEN list.  But since I'll have no closed list (for this purpose) I'll use the closed list processing rule (circle it for ever) but treat it as an open list in that I'll add to the end of it as I go.  Confusing enough for you?  ;-)  It's actually simple ... it just sounds confusing.<br><br>Then I'll still have the capability to review my "old" list if and when I want to, but I can work this new sublist in a hybrid AF kind of way... and I'll still have only one book to deal with.  When I get back, I can "erase" (more likely just ignore) my temporary line and pickup where I left off.  I suppose that anything left over from that temporary list that I could do ONLY on the trip but did not get done will just be dismissed.  I'll have to see how that works out.<br><br>Any thoughts on this?  Has anyone tried this kind of thing?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 November 2009 at 9:38 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike,<br><br>your idea of integrating the trip-list to your current list after you get back sounds good.  I'm not sure about the open part, though, I would miss the closed-list part of AF. Couldn't you just draw the closed-list-line at the end of your temporary list, and erase that afterwards also?<br><br>What I've done recently on a week-long trip was to transfer all tasks that I thought I could work on during the trip into a separate notebook, and mark them in the original notebook with a little pencil mark. After the trip, I crossed off everything in the original list that I worked on, and re-added them at the end if not yet completed. For anything I did not work on during the trip I just erased the pencil mark.<br><br>It's a bit more work preparing and cleaning up, but for me the advantage is that the trip-list can be worked in regular AF4-fashion, without being distracted by everything else on the list.  Another advantage for me is that everything I did not work on is still kept in the trip-notebook, so I can revert to that on my next trip (I'm travelling frequently to the same destination, so anything I can only do there is still kept in the notebook, as a kind of context-list).<br><br>BTW, this last trip also signalled to me that my AF4-list was getting way too long and that I had to declare a backlog.  Working with a short trip-list made me aware again of how AF4 is supposed to work!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 November 2009 at 13:37 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I did something relatively similar when I was at a conference in October.  Here's what my method was:<br><br>1) I didn't leave my main AF book home, but I did leave it in my hotel room.<br>2) Conveniently, part of the conference swag was a pocket-sized notebook so I declared that to be my AF book for the duration of the conference.<br>3) I culled my AF list, both closed and active, for tasks that I could work on (including thought-work) while at the conference.<br>4) I worked the list as normal, including review/dismissal.<br>5) When I got home, I reconciled the two lists, tacking new things on to the end and closing things that were completely done.  IIRC, things that had been marked for review were re-evaluated at that time and either dropped or re-entered in the main list.<br><br>It worked really well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 November 2009 at 14:05 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Nicole,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  your idea of integrating the trip-list to your current list after you get back sounds good. I'm not sure about the open part, though, I would miss the closed-list part of AF. Couldn't you just draw the closed-list-line at the end of your temporary list, and erase that afterwards also?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I could, but realize small that list will be.  I'm not going to populate the list with all kinds of wishes and dreams before I go.  The entire trip is going to be about five days and most of what I'm going to do is read and visit ;-)  So before I go out the dor I'll have some items on it like: "Wrap last minute packages" or "Give CDs to Brother-in-law" ... simple stuff like that.<br><br>I considered the open/closed aspect and decided that it would be so small that there would be little need or advantage having those two lists within such a short list.  I mean, the scan time would be about 15 seconds of so.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  What I've done recently on a week-long trip was to transfer all tasks that I thought I could work on during the trip into a separate notebook, and mark them in the original notebook with a little pencil mark. After the trip, I crossed off everything in the original list that I worked on, and re-added them at the end if not yet completed. For anything I did not work on during the trip I just erased the pencil mark.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>That could work too.  The only disadvantage to me is that I don't know what I might want to "think about" from my rather long list and that would mean a lot of pointless copying.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  It's a bit more work preparing and cleaning up, but for me the advantage is that the trip-list can be worked in regular AF4-fashion, without being distracted by everything else on the list. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>That is the advantage I see as well.  Except that I don't need both an open and closed list for something so short.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Another advantage for me is that everything I did not work on is still kept in the trip-notebook, so I can revert to that on my next trip (I'm travelling frequently to the same destination, so anything I can only do there is still kept in the notebook, as a kind of context-list).  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Ah, now that is an advantage to your approach.  I don't travel that much so it does not help me.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  BTW, this last trip also signalled to me that my AF4-list was getting way too long and that I had to declare a backlog. Working with a short trip-list made me aware again of how AF4 is supposed to work!  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yeah, size kills ;-)  I'm thinking it might pay to have some kind of rule for that.  Maybe move a pointer (paperclip or something, or maybe just pre-draw the line 5 pages ahead or something) and when you reach it, you automatically have your backlog declared when your active list grows to the critical size.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 November 2009 at 17:32 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sarah,<br><br>I can imagine it worked well.
