I took a look at them and they seemed a tad too large to carry "on me" and a tad too small to be otherwise useful.  I found that the absolutely smallest one that makes sense to me (if I don't carry it on me) is a "steno pad" ... which is about 6"x9", if memory serves.  8.5"x11" is about ideal for desk work, but a good happy medium is the composition book, cited above.  (Damn but the price on those has gone up!  I used to be able to get real "lab books" but I would not spend the money for them now.  They are nice because they have pre-numbered pages.)  I like the composition books because they are sewn and don't have rings to catch on things, but the ringed 8x11 books are cheapest ... under $1 on sale at back to school times.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2009 at 12:52 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use the pocket ruled moleskine, and use both pages (~44 lines, usually a few less since I date every page) as one.

I used to run my whole life with the lists I made in reporter's notebooks, but stopped using them when I began reading about 'proper' time-management.  I assumed they were a part of my old ignorant way of doing things that had to go.  I still feel nostalgic when I see them in shops -  now that really is sad!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2009 at 16:57 | acedia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In my case, it makes a difference what I am writing on in any "system" as to whether I will use it or not... have to have a good pen, a good paper, etc.  My current choice is a circa notebook in letter size because I can tear out my finished pages and move them to the back. It fulfills my need to be able to "start fresh" if I don't like something - even though I have not had to do this, it makes me feel better :)  I also would be able to use the smaller junior size, although neither is small enough to carry in a pocket.  These products are the ones with the "rolodex" type slots that allow removing and reinserting into the notebook.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2009 at 17:09 | Kaye</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Right now I'm using an old Cambridge City book I had that I wasn't using.

Also, I use the back of the book (working forward) for special lists so that would get in the way.  With the wire bound vertical format books I can fold them double and work on either the front of a page or the back ... and so I can work in one direction and not have to flip unless I need to access my special lists.<br><br>As to looking at the whole thing as a single long page ... I have two problems with that:<br><br>1) As I said before, I can't quite see how to write on the "top" part.  It kind of hangs out there in space.  How would I support it?  Hold the top and let the bottom "dangle"?<br><br>2) Visually, I don't like the two page spread.  I tried it with my wire bound book (to expand the 15 lines per page to 30 for the new "double virtual page", as it were.  It did not work for me.  Something about the physical page overrode the "virtual page".  Even though I told myself it was one long page my mind insisted on seeing it as two pages.<br><br>It is too bad, really.  I wish the reporter style would fold back over on itself.  That would be ideal for me.  I don't much like the wire spiral .. it catches on things.  But then again, it is a handy place to store my pen.  ;-)<br><br>Thanks again for taking the time to reply.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 April 2009 at 14:07 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My all-time favorite is the $2.79 Quad Ruled Composition book from Staples:  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p1_Staples-Composition-Notebooks_19440_Business_Supplies_10051_SEARCH">http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p1_Staples-Composition-Notebooks_19440_Business_Supplies_10051_SEARCH</a><br><br>A close second is the $3.49 National College-Ruled Composition book.  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p1_National-Brand-Composition-Notebook-Black_130135_Business_Supplies_10051_SEARCH">http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p1_National-Brand-Composition-Notebook-Black_130135_Business_Supplies_10051_SEARCH</a><br><br>They have $1 composition books at Walmart but they are all wide-ruled.
