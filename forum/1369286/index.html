It sounds like RECURRING is very similar to a TICKLER system.  Alan reviews his Recurring list daily to identify anything that should be brought into the Unfiinished/Active list.  NEW/OLD is basically "IN" - where things go until you decide what to do (or not do) with them.<br><br>I want to have a self-contained system and future items always pose an issue for me.  I'm stuck with a separate calendar for work (Outlook) and home (iCal).  Having them separate, and the fact that entering appointments on my iPhone is a bit cumbersome, deters me from using them more than I need to.  Adding a TICKLER type list to the other AF4R ones MF proposed seems like a simple and effective solution.  <br><br>So...I'm seeing a comprehensive system based on AF4R to include:<br><br>NEW/OLD = not started yet (note:  dismissed items are effectively SOMEDAY/MAYBE if not crossed out)<br>RECURRING = things I'm committed to doing on a regular basis, but have not been ready to be on my radar NOW yet<br>UNFINISHED = started, in progress, ACTIVE<br>LATER/TICKLER = not ready to be started yet (see this closely related to RECURRING...could potentially combine the two into one list with some items dated and some not)<br>PROJECT PAGES - This is a key piece.  Managing "projects" with GTD contexts was a mess for me.  I feel much more on top of things and liberated from to-do list management when my tasks and notes for each project are in the same place.  I expect this will dramatically reduce the length of AF4R lists as well since many items will just be the project name<br><br>Not to bring up the dreaded Kanban word again, but this seems to flow along in that way.  Unfinished list items are the ACTIVE ones.  Items flow from list to list with Unfinished being the NOW.<br><br>Anyway, I am going to try this with a couple of minor tweaks.  First, I'll put a due date for the task/project in the left column when applicable.  That will give me good guidance as I'm looking through the list.  Also, I'll put a dash in the margin for todos - which I'll circle if there is a corresponding project page.<br><br>This is something I can see myself sticking with.  It's easy to spend way to much time migrating from one system to another.

Intuition is preserved and tasks are easy to manage.<br><br>So I added my projects to and this afternoon i just did as you said for my most important projects "My project pages (groups of related tasks) are labeled with tabs so I can see them all at a glance. A project is treated exactly like any other task."<br><br>I have reorganized my binder with 2 parts and 2 kinds of tabs. <br>The biggers are for AF <br>The smallers are for projects grouped by area. (GTD principle)<br><br>For my tasks I tweaked AF list with 3 colums<br>due date + Project + Action <br><br>Then I can see at a glance all my project list<br><br>For the moment i keep omnifocus for complicated project or really future one's<br><br>I aggre with scott gtd contexts are a real mess.<br><br>I also took a 1 page diary (a lucas) and i reported my day as a journal. + my appoitments of the day it gave me a lot of ideas to put in my binder. <br><br>OF course i keep the double reading AF MF method. It's so great. <br><br>I think I will never get rid of paper. <br>With computer i loose all my intuition <br>I dont understand why.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 January 2011 at 21:07 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>&lt;&lt;Have you thought of taking up a career as a time management guru? &gt;&gt;<br><br>he he!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 January 2011 at 23:11 | leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan Baljeu: "Active includes stuff I'm working on. When I'm done (for now), they go back to new or recurring."<br><br>When do you actually write something in the Active page? The moment before you start working on it? For all tasks? Or just those that take more than a couple of minutes?<br><br>The reason I'm asking is the following. I have been working with AF4R + 3T (electronic), but have been struggling with some overhead caused by the fact that I'm copying all the tasks that "feel ready to be done" to a separate page (for 3Tasks). While this provides the benefits of 3T, I feel it gives too much overhead of having to copy tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2011 at 15:09 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Why copy it?  As I understood, Mark just flags the items in af4+3t, then worked on them.  At work I just drag/drop things to the active page.  Very quick.  At home (paper) I don't bother unless it's something I will continue working on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2011 at 17:34 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Since 14 I have been working on Alan system on a AF4R system. <br><br>I stick with the system ! (at last) <br><br>Of course I still live AF1 but I have a real control about my active/unfinished tasks, my new and old ones, my scheduled tasks, my recurrings tasks and my someday may be tasks and project.  <br><br>I also have a perfect following of my projects and aims. <br><br>The only inconvenient is the size of my binder (a A4) and it weight . Not easy to put it in a wallet when i am outside and have to work on something. <br><br>Anyway I am very please with the system. Of course i tried some others (paper system from Pascal, Waf) just one day with test and nothing yet got me such a feeling of beeing in the right direction except AF1 with flags. <br><br>I found anyway a little inconvenient with AF1 i never exactly where I was going to. In fact i did my job and at the end of the day I noticed I did the most important but I did not know really how and why. With AF4R I think more. I take time to do things and my productivity is less in amount of tasks than in AF1 or even in AF4.But there is a real advantage. In a glance I know exactly where are my bigs rocks and what i must do. I also know all whicj is active so I can focus on it and do what must be. <br><br>I often regret AF1 when i was advancing in a thick fogs but doing things without really wondering how and the enthousiasm which brought me little by little to the end. <br>With AF4R there is alway a dog leash which dont let me go to the uncertain but leads me to a real control. I dont know yet if it is better. I guess my intuition was more increased by af1 that it AF4R even if sometime the system increased so fast that i wondered exactly how i could handle it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2011 at 16:30 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Glad to hear it, Jupiter.<br>"The only inconvenient is the size of my binder (a A4) and it weight .

But dont mistake i keps my unfinished active divider for later if it doesnt sits to me. So it is just a try to see if it s better or not. <br><br>Anyway I kept my binder and the basic alan's method and as i explained (see 14th of january) and it is terrific !</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2011 at 20:11 | FocusGuy.</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
