The steps are progressive.  Introduce steps one at a time.  Stop if you feel sufficiently organized.  Many people stop after 0, 1 or 2.  Few people go beyond 3.  Those who do (and don't know this site) often get lost in complex systems.<br><br>	0. If you know what you should do next, do it.<br>Systems are imperfect.  Don't let this keep you from what needs doing.  And if you do anything, take credit.  <br><br>	1. Keep a calendar of appointments, meetings, hard deadlines.  <br>	2. Keep a to-do list, so you don't forget to do stuff.<br>	3. Make a day plan.<br>Each day, write a plan for the things you *will do tomorrow*  (but not things you "might do, depending").  Schedule time blocks for key activities.  As you follow the plan, fill the gaps with self-directed activities, possibly from the following systems.<br><br>	4. AutoFocus<br>This replaces #2.  Apply one of Mark's AutoFocus systems to your to-dos.  Include everything.  <br><br>	5. Handle Interruptions<br>See rule 0.  For tasks that arise, make a note in the AF list.  Use a pocket list when AF isn't around.<br><br>	6. Make Projects<br>You may collect related tasks into a project list.  If planning is required, do it.  If notes or materials exist, keep it all together.  Organize projects in simple fashion (e.g. alphabetically), and keep them accessible.  AutoFocus will contain a reference to the project, and/or hot tasks  for the project.  <br><br>	7. Handle Goals<br>My simple approach: Put the goals in AF.  Set up a project for thinking about them.  Process a goal by reviewing your tasks and increasing goal-oriented tasks.<br><br>	8. Handle Delegation<br>Delegate stuff from your AF list.  Keep a project to track the work.  Leave it accessible.  Interruptions can be handled by turning to the project.  Keep the AF item around to remind you to follow up if progress is slow.<br>	<br>	9. Buy and read about Mark's Final Version<br>In case the first 9 are insufficient.  Actually, buy it anyway.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 September 2011 at 23:42 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's great!!

For my part, I recently became convinced of the necessity of the dayplan.  It's a notion that's been forming over many months. I now feel it's more basic than AutoFocus, because finding "pick up kids from soccer" an hour late isn't a good idea. <br><br>Goals and delegation are equally recent addititions to my toolbox.

That and "urgent: buy milk" and "music practice 2 hours" fit a day plan better than AutoFocus.

During the academic year, a lot of my work revolves around very short term deadlines (teaching prep, student emails, committee meetings, etc.). The combination of urgency and frequent deadlines makes a day plan a good tool, just to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.<br><br>I just realized that I need a different time management system for the summer (no teaching, few meetings) and the academic year.

That helps me identify things that, although on first glance aren't necessary today, will make life easier. For example, we have enough groceries for several days, but today has the only 90-minute slot that's kid-free during store hours. Normally I go another day, but that won't work this week.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2011 at 15:42 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is really good as it is so simple and focused - thank you very much Alan. I've even copied it so I can put it into my filofax to remind me!<br><br>A couple of things I would add which have helped me:<br><br>1. I keep a 'tickler file' for hard copy stuff that needs keeping for a specific day or month. I don't get a lot of this, but it solves the dilemma of where to keep stuff.<br><br>2. I have some files on my desk labelled 'shredding', 'accounts', waiting for and so on which help me to keep organised. When I get to my desk I drop anything to shred in the shredding one and any receipts for my accounts in the other one, then file when I get chance. I keep these files in a rack I got from staples - looks a bit like a toaster rack that holds several files upright on the desktop.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2011 at 17:13 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark wrote:<br>&lt;&lt;Mind you, my Final Version can cope with those type of things very well - so maybe you won't need the day plan after all!&gt;&gt;<br><br>Whee!<br>Day plan = dashboard, more or less</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2011 at 5:56 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like the way these posts are getting down to basics lately, and stressing the main positives (and negatives).<br><br>For me, the Day Plan is indispensable if you use it for how it is meant to be used (not a wish list, and not something that needs a lot of maintenance).  <br><br>Not only do I like to have something to complement the more event-oriented agenda/calendar, I find it the main tool to bring me back to earth if I tend to shoot off in many directions putting out fires and responding to emails, etc.<br> <br>I put my top three "rocks" (my 'Tres Pierdas') in rather large rectangles and, of course, want to spend the first concentration of the day on these important tasks (rather than the busy work or the small items you want to knock out before 'getting down to business').  <br><br>Sometimes, it's noon before I realise I have not done a thing (important).<br><br>The other thing is that my three big rectangles in my new Day Plan each day clearly indicate the beginning of a new day, and make it clear where I need to do my little morning mind-dump to get started.<br><br>Week Plans ??  I am glad Cricket has success with these, but for me, they always sound good in theory but tend to overlap with the DP or even the Project Tasks or just turn into an AF-type list all on their own, and very quickly.<br><br>Anyway, Alan, well-done and concisely outlined.  <br>I think your 1-3-4 hits the nail on the head as far as simplicity goes.  Thanks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2011 at 13:09 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan, great system. Personally, I would put "ticklers" as 3.5. Unlike Alison (comment above), I use it very often and for all the tasks lying in between "hard dates" and "anytime to-dos", probably in rather GTD way. E.g. I want to play squash at the end of the week, check bank account at the beginning of the month, go shopping on Wednesday, think about the proposal around Friday but not before, water flowers once a week (that day when I will return home earlier which I do not know at the moment, having irregular schedules) etc. For all those tasks I set due date, which means for me "on that day, think what to do about this task" and that day I either move due date or do the task (or copy it to daily plan). After completing, I delete it from tickler, or (if repeating) move it to new due date. Thus I also solved how I should manage repeating tasks which do not repeat regularly (e.g. every Monday etc.) Of course, I keep these tasks apart from normal calendar.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2011 at 15:37 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Agreed, the Week Plan often overlaps with the Day Plan. Sometimes I only go as far as the Week Plan when making my Day Plan. Sometimes my Day Plan includes the line "check Week Plan". It all depends on how distractable I am that week how I use them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2011 at 16:15 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Daneb's method is basically the same as mine, and I've always found it works much better for me than having a week plan.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2011 at 21:01 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Since I introduced day planning into my recent practice, I'm finding the desire for Autofocus diminishing at home, though not at work. It's more relaxing to know everything is done and leave be, compared to trudging through a list all evening. This resolves the problem of coming home too tired or too little time for real progress. <br><br>My home AF is then relegated to Saturdays, and my plans otherwise are growing, picking up daily and weekly recurring items, scheduled items, and new urgent/important/desired items getting plugged in. It works because all three of those are relatively few. <br><br>So home life stops at #3 for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 September 2011 at 12:44 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Alan<br><br>I red again your post which I found interesting, indeed. <br>I just wonder.

I require a quick-view index page with the daily or weekly record of events/projects/contents.  <br><br>On this index page, I don't want any clutter; I just want reminders and links to something as short as a simple hyperlink, or to something as bulky as a large amount of pasted text, an Office document, a PDF, images, web clippings or whatever.<br><br>I have tried EverNote and Circus Ponies' Notebook (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.circusponies.com/">http://www.circusponies.com/</a> ).  I find Mariner's MacJournal (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/">http://www.marinersoftware.com/</a> ) useful for project support and reference, with excellent iDevice syncing, but it just does not cut it for me as a solution to Jupiter's original question above:<br> <br>"When your are at work you receive many incoming information about many subjects we could call Notes. Where do you collect them and how…"<br><br>I have indeed simplified MacJournal and have found a way to use internal links, and therefore improving my search capability and have managed to simplify "indexing" of events and content.  <br><br>However, what I am really starting to like again is VooDooPad for the Mac (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/</a> ).  It took me awhile to study all their features and shortcuts (and play with it) before it started to appear like a viable option.  Their syncing feature to the iPhone and iPad leaves a lot to be desired, though.  So currently, I am just using their free reader for the iDevices (called "VP Reader"), which works with Wi-Fi.<br><br>I also find TextExpander (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/</a> ) very useful, especially with VooDooPad.  As they say on their main web page:  "TextExpander saves you countless keystrokes with customized abbreviations for your frequently-used text strings and images."<br><br>Perhaps this subject would be suitable for another thread as it is aimed at Mac users (there are lots of references to OneNote on this forum).

I use it to my great satisfaction (but not for time management, just for notes, goals, ideas etc.).

They have no mechanism to sync to the iPad or iPhone.  However, I did write the developer informing him that is took mere seconds to transfer a pdf of Growley Notes to the iPad/iPhone using a simple app like ACTPrinter.  (He appreciated that tip.)<br><br>Growley uses unfriendly text boxes for each new entry (theme/event).  I need the contiunal flow of entries and ability to make links to other pages and sites lightning fast (I just want to hit return and want my formatting pre-defined).  The developer went on to inform me that he had tried to do an iPad app, but that he gave up on it (and will never try it again).<br><br>As it stands now, VooDooPad still just gets better and better the more I use it.
