Also, there's quite a few bogus items on it, like "shut the computer."  And recurring tasks.  As I looked through the list, I found a couple of duplicates and deep-sixed a few others, so it was a useful exercise.  And, of course, there's something compelling about getting stuff done and crossing them off your list and after going through the list, I see a lot of ripe items on it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 July 2009 at 0:50 | Balfour</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have an office list (stuff I can't do anywhere else) and an the main list where I put everything else (including work stuff I can do at home) - this helps me focusing on the office stuff during the day.

So, the AF list has almost become my "someday maybe" list, though I do refer to it to pick out items to do at weekends or on slack days... I haven't started using AF2 yet.<br><br>I don't have a time frame, but I try to have "purge days" every now and then, where I make a point of trying to get rid of everything on the oldest page (either by dismissing or doing it) - it gives me an enourmous sense of satisfaction.
