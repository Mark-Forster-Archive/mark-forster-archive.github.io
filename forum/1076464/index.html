Anybody have suggestions for communicating what needs doing (lots of things), and who is doing them?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 April 2010 at 18:01 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan, not sure if it's over-kill for your situation, but in most places where I've worked that were efficiently run, we did up a list of deliverables and deadlines for projects and whose responsibility it was to get them to us (for external people).  They weren't necessarily the ones actually doing it.  <br><br>We also kept internal calendars of deadlines, deliverables and who was assigned to what deliverable. <br><br>We did it all in excel and just emailed it out.  <br><br>I've also done the same thing managing it in Outlook (the delegate function).  I preferred excel though for some reason, probably because I'm lazy and could get the junior intern type people to just change everything for me.  If it was in my outlook, I'd have to either grant them access or do it myself.<br><br>Where I am now, they have an internal calendar set up in Outlook for the whole finance team with all the stuff due on it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 April 2010 at 20:12 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I assume you had a manager who assigned tasks to people?<br><br>I'm looking to have people assign themselves.  The question is making stuff visible, and establishing a framework for everyone to actively participate. I would like a little more structure than just one open list in excel. <br><br> I don't have outlook literacy as far as group delegation is concerned and don't have ms exchange.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 April 2010 at 22:15 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yup, I was the manager that assigned the projects to people.  People can assign themselves but someone has to ensure that everything gets done.  And there are always some jobs that have to be delegated just because nobody wants to do them.  We'd just meet as a group before month-ends, quarters or special projects etc. to review who was doing what and switch things up if desired and it made sense.<br><br>Are you looking for a flow chart / project plan type of dependency?  That was built into our excel model.  Believe me, it was very structured.  <br><br>There's a thread around here about 8 months or so ago where we were talking about Gantt, PERT - all that fun stuff.  Why don't you do up a model with post-it notes?  <br><br>Otherwise, I don't know - the original scenario was kind of vague as to what you were looking to achieve.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 April 2010 at 23:53 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, I'm good at being vague. :-/<br><br>I'm not interested in PERT, GANTT stuff.  These are small projects, but we have half a dozen of them on the go, and each of them have a variety of tasks associated with them.  I simply want everyone to be fully aware of what's going on, and to participate by suggesting things that need doing, figuring out priorities intuitively (with discussion), picking things that are ready to be done, and communicate that it's being done.  <br><br>I guess a doable approximation of this is a spreadsheet I manage, with tasks organized into groups, mailed to everyone, and I update it on request.  I just feel like there might be a better way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 April 2010 at 0:30 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>What about a google docs spreadsheet, or a Google Wave?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 April 2010 at 1:34 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Explain?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 April 2010 at 2:06 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A Google Docs spreadsheet is available to your whole team.

It is pretty free form and can be quite clunky in its present beta form. And can't do tables. <br><br>I think a simple Google spreadsheet is the way to go.

We used to do that as well for Sarbanes Oxley tracking (have to show what had changed).   When reviewing, if there was conflicts, I would set things up so that I manually overruled other users changes.  (Hmm. Can I do that here too? LOL)  What version are you running?  I'm on 2003 at this client, missing the new one badly.  Did you do this from the help?:<br>_______________________________________________________________________<br>Turn on change tracking for a workbook<br>On the Tools menu, click Share Workbook, and then click the Editing tab. <br>Select the Allow changes by more than one user at the same time check box. <br>Click the Advanced tab. <br>Under Track changes, click Keep change history for, and in the Days box, type the number of days of change history that you want to keep. <br>Be sure to enter a large-enough number of days because Microsoft Excel permanently erases any change history older than this number of days. <br><br>Click OK, and if prompted to save the file, click OK. <br>Note   Turning on change tracking also shares the workbook. <br>________________________________________________________________________<br><br>I'm not sure that it would be good as a virtual whiteboard.  You can do the same thing in Word - track changes that is.  We used to do that all the time for annual reports &amp; legal stuff.
