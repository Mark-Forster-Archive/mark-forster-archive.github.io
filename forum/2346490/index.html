In response to that desire Mark Forster and many of us have made many such systems.  And yet without exception each and everyone of them we discard or set aside for another system, either new or old.  We have been thinking it could be because we get bored of them, we need novelty, etc.<br><br>Well I have been thinking: could it be because each system is not suitable for ALL situations?<br><br>Maybe the solution is not to use one of these system, but to use ALL (or maybe MOST) of them depending on the situation.<br><br>Here's the scenario: you have a list of tasks.  Let's either not think of dismissal for now, or use a time-based dismissal system like DWM2 or DSAF which is not affected by the task choosing process you are going to use.  Looking at your own situation right now, how would you process the task?<br><br>Maybe you are feeling low on willpower right now? Use the randomizer, which has been shown to cut through resistance.  Maybe the list is getting stale and you want to make it look fresh? Use AF2ND or FV.  Maybe you are really hyped and full of energy right now? Use SFv3.  Maybe you need to finish a particular project ASAP? Use SMEMA.  And so on.<br><br>Please note that the algorithm I just outlined is probably not correct and definitely not complete.  And yes, I am thinking of making an algorithm to determine the method/s to use depending on subjective (one's energy, willpower, courage, anxiety levels), temporal (amount of time, urgency), aesthetic (list looking stale), and other criteria.<br><br>So what I think we need is looking at our use of the different systems in the past and try to remember what exactly made those system work for us and what made them not work.  From our recollections and experiences we may just be able to make an algorithm that we can use.  I will start with my own recollections in the next post.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2014 at 0:38 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>DWM2 - I highly recommend this as the base on which we use the algorithm.

The people who post here are a small, self-selected portion of those who use Mark's systems, and by nature we are the type who like to experiment with productivity systems. The fact that we sometimes switch frequently does not necessarily suggest that the systems are not maintainable in the long term. And I think that most of us have found at least one or two systems that, when we choose to use them for a long time without switching, they work quite well consistently. I have personally found this with DIT, FV, UTMS, and the Remelsbach system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2014 at 3:48 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Mark Forster: &lt;&lt;I don't think it's a good idea to make it *too* complicated.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Well maybe making the algorithm *too* specific would make the system too complicated, maybe just a set of rough recommendations of which system to use for some circumstances would suffice.<br><br>Although I think it is wrong that you can change systems on the drop of the hat; I think it would be best if one can change system only when he/she has reached the end of the list.<br><br>&lt;&lt;How about the following:&gt;&gt;<br><br>Hmm, interesting ideas, but aren't those recommendations a bit too specific, Mark?

Here are my own preferences: I agree with you that when resistance to getting moving is an issue, Remelsbach works very well. When I find that I'm not resisting using a system, but I'm using the systems to procrastinate, I'll use DIT because it has less tolerance for that sort of thing and the focus is more on getting the right work done every day. When I'm in the same context all day and I just want a relaxed day of getting a lot of different things worked on, I'll use FV. When I want to focus on completing one or two assignments, but getting little one-offs done as necessary, I'll use UTMS. Finally, when I have a major project due in a day or two and want to work on  just that one project all day, I'll use either SMEMA or timed bursts, or even just an impromptu today list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2014 at 17:14 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'll add that there are some systems which do actually facilitate rapid switching without a significant downside, and others that take time to get up and running. AF1 is an example of one that takes time to get up and running. Remelsbach and FV are two systems that start working right away, and don't work any less well at the beginning than they do later on. You can switch back and forth between FV and Remelsbach as often as you want (obviously not mid-FV chain, though) because both systems start working right away and do not function any differently over time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2014 at 17:36 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good thinking, linking us to descriptions. And thanks! I'd forgotten AF2. Today that seems like a good choice. (Change that. Just finished describing Reverse FV.)<br><br>This matches my observations about myself. Randomizer is great for breaking inertia or resistance, but I don't trust it to give me the urgent things, so it only works if I'm confident the urgent things are under control. A variation on FV is good if I'm not confident, and want to make the best choice, but not if I finish the chain. (I'll always reactivate the oldest task rather than delete or defer.)<br><br>Systems with fixed dismissal don't work for me. I'd have to dismiss or quickly action too many large, high-resistance projects. I want to focus on just a few and keep momentum.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2014 at 17:49 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Hmm, interesting ideas, but aren't those recommendations a bit too specific, Mark? Why did you recommend those steps? &gt;&gt;<br><br>First I'd emphasis that I wasn't "recommending" them; I was only suggesting them as possibles. I hadn't tried the idea out at all when I wrote the post and was just playing with the idea - which I do find a good one as I said.<br><br>However if you want my specific reasoning for my specific suggestions:<br><br>1) The AF1 method of working a page is great for thinning out urgent and routine tasks, and is therefore most suitable for the end of the list.<br><br>2) The Randomizer is the best there is for getting rid of resistance to the really tough tasks which won't budge. Therefore suitable for getting the first page moving, which is where they all end up.<br><br>3) Selecting forward repeatedly from the first task on the list was the first TM system I ever thought up. It had two disadvantages though: 1) I always ended up skipping the tough nuts on the first page which had been passed over time after time; 2) there was a long journey to get to the urgent and routine tasks at the far end of the list. Using the Randomizer for the first page and AF1 for the last pages seems to solve both these problems.<br><br>I started trying this out today, but I've been away for most of the day so haven't really been able to judge it yet.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2014 at 21:52 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Austin:<br><br>&lt;&lt; The people who post here are a small, self-selected portion of those who use Mark's systems, and by nature we are the type who like to experiment with productivity systems. &gt;&gt;<br><br>This is something I've pointed out several times.

And it's because I came to a very different conclusion about what the problem really is.<br><br>About a month ago, I posted this well-researched article on how people actually make use of their task lists:   <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2324914">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2324914</a><br><br>Two statistics from their results really stood out for me:<br>41% of to-do items were never completed<br>15% of dones started as to-do items<br><br>I spent some time reflecting on this, and realized these numbers are pretty accurate for me as well.   If anything, my own numbers are a little more extreme:   a higher percentage of the items on my lists never get done.   And I'd say the 15% of dones starting as to-do items is about right.<br><br>Here is where most of my "dones" actually happen:<br>- Done immediately after becoming aware of the task:<br>-- Wife asks me to do something<br>-- Coworker asks me to do something<br>-- Email triggers an action (most of which are short and immediate)<br>-- "Walking around" triggers an action (whether at home, at work, driving around, etc.)<br><br>- Done collaboratively in a pre-scheduled meeting<br><br>- Done immediately after a pre-scheduled meeting, as a result of an "action item" assigned in that meeting<br><br>- Done as a result of habit, routine, or schedule<br><br><br>My "deep focus", personal kanban, and "calendar as kanban" experiments all pointed in this direction also:  they made me realize how much (or how little) discretionary time I really have, after I take care of regular habit items (personal care, commuting, eating, evening routine with family, etc.), take care of recurring maintenance (email, etc.), and meetings.<br><br>So, I have come to the conclusion that spending a lot of time trying to optimize how I spend my discretionary time delivers about as much value as re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  :-)<br><br>That just isn't where the real value is to be found.<br><br>The study I referenced above demonstrates that it's not just me.<br><br><br>This doesn't mean we can just let our task management fester into chaos.   It does mean it just isn't the area that needs a lot of focus and optimization for most people to make a big impact on their personal effectiveness.   The discretionary task management just needs enough attention so it doesn't create a lot of stress and isn't a total mess.  <br><br>The simplest method I've found for actually handling tasks is to sort them in Outlook or in my paper notebook so I handle the most-recently added items first.   In other words, I enter tasks just like in DIT, but I process them differently:  just look at the most recent stuff first, and go backwards.   Don't worry about dismissal or anything like that at all.   Just work on the most recently entered items that seem to need attention.   Maybe put a star or something next to the critical items with deadlines, and focus on those first.   Or maybe not.   Don't worry about it.   It doesn't matter a whole lot.   When you run out of time, stop working.   (again, emphasizing schedule and calendar over the to-do list)<br><br>If you get stuck, combine this approach with a random number generator:  choose the item 1-20 items down from the top of the list  (ie., counting down from the most recently entered item).   This means you will always choose one of the top twenty most recently entered items.  <br><br>Focusing on the most recent items only, seems to work OK because that's where the freshest items are.   If something rolls off the list, out of site, it's probably OK -- if it's really needed, you'll think of it anyway, or someone else will remind you.  <br><br>And then, stop worrying about it, and focus attention where bigger benefits can be made:  <br>- how you handle immediate needs<br>- how you handle your routine, habits, and schedule<br>- how you handle your calendar.   <br><br>This has been helping me a lot.   I feel like I have more time and am getting a lot more done.   And the really funny thing is, the discretionary items have been handled pretty well too:  I really feel like the right things are getting done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 May 2014 at 6:18 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>This is actually the long hoped-for revolution in the way that you look at those 400+ items on your to do list that caused you so much trouble in the past and which you were so reluctant to let go of, isn't it?<br><br>What you are describing is essentially AF2, but liberated from the weight of trying to get all 400+ tasks done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 May 2014 at 10:46 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In the meantime, my little experiment (and that's all it is) of mixing the Randomizer, Reverse AF2 and AF1 is going surprisingly well.

The reason you haven't been happy with any task-management system is that you simply haven't given it a chance.

I think sometimes it's true, I spend more time fiddling with these systems than I do working them, but for the most part I have had the most amazing experiences of stress free productivity. Most of my friends and colleagues are amazed at what I am able to accomplish through my management of time - I'm full time pastor of a parish that has doubled in growth in the last 4 years, I've almost finished my course work for my PhD in religious studies and Buddhism, I ran and won a seat as a trustee in our last municipal election, I'm chair of our school board's audit committee (with a 250,000,000 budget) and I'm having a blast. I even taught a second year university course last fall (70 students) with no teaching assistants, and anyone who has ever taught for the first time knows how much work that is. I also learned to read German last spring and I'm about to take a French translation exam in a few weeks. Every time I get tempted to move back to Covey or GTD my life suddenly gets frighteningly chaotic. So for me, there's more going on here than just fiddling with systems and avoiding work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2014 at 13:21 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>On another note...<br>I've been thinking. It seems to me that the huge value I felt when I first started using Mark's systems was a kind of liberation brought on by a sense of control about my work and a complete lack of resistance. What a great way to live! But the liberation doesn't always last, probably because no system is going to take away my own responsibility for making decisions about my work. Since I started using randomizer, however, I felt that the combination of knowing what my work is (control) and the lack of resistance has been the key to stress free life. But now, introducing adaptive focus seems to be introducing resistance again, as I have to make decisions about which "tool" to use. <br>So I'm trying something that eliminates that decision and its working beautifully. I have taken the decision-making out of "which tool to use" as well: In the morning I use SMEMA, because I usually wake up with stuff on my mind that I have to do anyway. In the afternoon I use randomizer because I have no motivation and my resistance to all tasks is unusually high. In the evening I use some version of AF (usually 1) so I can tie up loose ends, maybe finish off a page or two that have orphan tasks. I populate the list using DWM2 (with the dots - for the dismissal). Those are all the process decisions I need to make, which allows me to direct my energy to my work. <br>So far it's working beautifully and I'm feeling a sense of freedom that borders on spiritual.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2014 at 13:22 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark, I understand and please be assured it's not my intention to disparage any methodologies which help people achieve what matters in their lives.  I was just interested to see nuntym's opening post which suggested that since systems get abandoned what we need is to try even harder to use the right system.  That to me is begging the question.<br><br>To use the diet analogy again, lots of people have great success on a packaged diet such as Weight Watchers, so in that sense they can work.  My own personality is such that I want to know why it works, and that comes down to outsourcing decisions about what you're allowed to eat to the framework of the diet, eliminating lots of wrong foods and restricting calories.  So then I look at the effect of restricting calories and certain types of food and the effect that has.  Then I get into the nutritional science behind it and ultimately understand why the diet works.  Now knowing this I can implement the underlying science and in a more personally tailored way without needing the higher level diet package.  I'm no longer "on a diet", I'm simply following a change of lifestyle based on an understanding of what I'm trying to achieve.<br><br>I followed the same path with personal productivity systems.  The journey was pretty much the same as the article I linked to (thanks for editing to http).  The end result now is that I know in intricate detail how and why this human condition works and how and why I sabotage my own discretionary time.  So I am at peace with that.  If I want to get something done that is not very appealing I know I have to do it, in which case I make a start on it.  I no longer need to have a system like AF or FV tell me I should do it, just as I no longer need a Weight Watchers to tell me what I can eat.<br><br>If you like, the productivity system approach is like the diet approach for me, it can work and usually does for a while but I sabotage my own progress, and that's okay because I know why.  The solution for me isn't a new system or diet, it's the understanding of why it always pans out this way and why the bits that work do work, and then just getting on and incorporating them into my lifestyle.  Hence for me no more diets, now I eat much better because I understand the nutritional science behind it, and no more productivity systems, now I am much more productive in both daily and long term goal aspects of my life because I understand the psychology behind it.<br><br>From there the tools I use are simple ones which support those changes, so the behavioural changes if you like drive the tools used, while diets and productivity systems are tools which are trying to drive change, often successfully but also often against the grain leading to an insidious feeling of stress or guilt.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2014 at 13:40 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Chris, thank you for these thoughts. I think a lot of us (all of us?) can relate to your sentiments, though we may take a slightly different approach to solving the problem. You figured out how to correct the "gaming" and then decided you really only need a simple list system, consisting of home, work, text calendar, and sometimes a paper today list. That's great, but someone here could reason in the same way and reach this conclusion instead: "I've figured out how to correct the 'gaming,' so now all I need is a simple list and a simple algorithm to decide in what order to proceed - the Final Version." That person arguably has an even simpler method than you do, since he has only one list. I can't relate to Seraphim's 400+ tasks at all. I've always done a double-take when I see his numbers. I *never* have more than 100 tasks, and it's rare that  my FV list grows to more than a few pages. In fact, every so often I even catch up to "today" - meaning everything on my list was entered today.<br><br>The No S Diet has been working really well for me for months, too.<br><br>I always find your posts here interesting and insightful, though.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2014 at 14:40 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think the key thing here is the (I) statements For example: <br><br>&lt;&lt;Chris: (I) no longer need to have a system like AF or FV tell me (I) should do it, just as (I) no longer need a Weight Watchers to tell me what I can eat.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Works for Chris?

Just a few personal comments:<br><br>1) Re re-arranging deckchairs on the Titanic and/or pushing peas around the plate. This of course can happen with almost anything. One of the reasons I picked Chinese as a "special project" was the immense amount of deckchair arranging that goes into language learning. If you google "learning Chinese" you will find an immense amount of conflicting theories. Some of it is sensible, some of it gimmicky and some of it frankly nonsense. It's not helped by the fact that some of the people who talk the most sense also talk the most nonsense at other times!<br><br>2) As Chris says the solution is to get to where you understand why it works and why it doesn't and then keep it stripped down to those basic structures.<br><br>3) And perhaps the most important point of all, the effort to get and keep the systems right is immensely worthwhile.<br><br>I feel a blog post coming on!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2014 at 16:40 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Works for Chris?

She gets an idea, throws herself into it, and produces impressive results. <br><br>It's enviable, and a total disaster when I try it. So I need to cobble together bits of motivation, accountability and tools that help chip away at my own resistance. It's a never ending battle.

It's in fact the obvious progression from my discovery that the weak link was reverse AF2, but it took me a while to get to it because I was trying to find a way of moving from Randomizer to AF1 in the same pass through the list.<br><br>But what I've found is that it works much better just to do alternate passes through the list with the Randomizer and AF1. In fact it doesn't just work much better. It works extremely well.<br><br>How I do it:<br><br>!) I start by going through the list as normal in AF1 with one exception - there is no compulsion to do any tasks on a page. This also means there is no dismissal. <br><br>2) Once I've got to the end of the list I go through the list again using the Randomizer. I set the maximum for the number of lines on the page and use the sliding rules. Once I get to the end of the list I let the Randomizer take me to a task on the first page, and once I've done that task I switch back to AF1.<br><br>This system provides very fast passes through the list, which means that it works for all but the most urgent of urgent tasks and also gives plenty of opportunity for "little and often".<br><br>I recommend everyone to give it a try.

I kept finding that finishing the Randomizer pass by letting it take me to a task on the first page caused me to forget that I was then supposed to switch to AF1.

Do you start the randomizer from the last task you completed during the AF1 cycle or from the first task on the first page? &gt;&gt;<br><br>The first task on the first page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2014 at 22:03 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Paul MacNeil: &lt;&lt;So far it's working beautifully and I'm feeling a sense of freedom that borders on spiritual. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Woo! Great job! :D THIS is what I want to see when I made this thread: people working out ways to get what they need from Mark Forster's and other's systems and adopt them into their lives.<br><br>&lt;&lt;But now, introducing adaptive focus seems to be introducing resistance again, as I have to make decisions about which "tool" to use.  So I'm trying something that eliminates that decision and its working beautifully.&gt;&gt;<br><br>I realized this too, Paul, so I decided on using "fallback" tools on what to use whenever I am having resistance.  I discussed this in my DWM2 thread.<br><br>@Mark Forster: &lt;&lt;I recommend everyone to give it a try. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Nice one Mark :) I'm still having fun with my own use of DWM2, Randomizer, and AF4-Closed-List-Processing (which I explained in the DWM2 thread) so I'll try it later.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 May 2014 at 13:14 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Mark and Nuntym for your replies. For the last few days I have pretty much adopted Mark's randomizer and AF1 system and it seems to be meeting my needs amazingly well, although I am going to confess that I'm feeling a tiny bit of resistance when I'm in the AF1 mode. I'm sure it has something to do with taking responsibility for the choices I make. I feel most free when I'm in randomizer mode, although, weirdly, perhaps even paradoxically, sometimes I dread going into randomizer mode because there's some stuff on the list I don't want to do. Does that make sense?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2014 at 1:20 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Paul MacNeil:<br><br>&lt;&lt;  I am going to confess that I'm feeling a tiny bit of resistance when I'm in the AF1 mode. &gt;&gt;<br><br>The AF1 pass is really an opportunity to action stuff which needs to get done more quickly than can be left up to random chance. I'm thinking of things like checking your email and other routine work, plus any new stuff that requires to be cleared urgently. <br><br>That's why there is no requirement to do any tasks on a page (or indeed during the entire pass come to that).<br><br>&lt;&lt; I feel most free when I'm in randomizer mode, although, weirdly, perhaps even paradoxically, sometimes I dread going into randomizer mode because there's some stuff on the list I don't want to do.
