The best advice I was given was to just acknowledge that when you are thinking about your mission and your goals, it can  sound really inflated, but just  accept that as part of the process. You not only can think big but should think big. Just that intention, aiming for something important, will bring very many benefits and as you achieve goals the next steps or stages will become clearer. I am glad that I spent two years in Santa Barbara because, among other things, I got comfortable with some tools that might seem "whoo-whoo" but which bring results.<br><br>Speaking for myself, I find that "short term" (one year) and "long term" (five years) are the most useful.<br><br>My first five year plan was transitioning from lawyer to sculptor. I was astounded when I realized I'd done that, because it was like turning the Titanic around and it took "a while." I used a similar process when I was trying to find a university teaching job.

Why we sometimes accept it at "work" but resist it in our own lives is a mystery.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 19:54 | Liz I.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is a topic I have given a lot of thought to this year and in doing so have read several books, articles, blogs, etc as well as journeled, made lists, re-wrote lists...I found it is indeed a process! <br><br>One book that really helped me was written in the mid-80's and that I *accidently* ordered off Amazon. It is called: Time Power by Charles R. Hobbs. It really helped me identify my real values and how to translate that into goals. He just explained it in a way that no one else had. (I thought I was buying Brian Tracy's book by the same name--who, btw, also has some great material on this and related topics).<br><br>Here is the url to Time Power on Amazone: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://tinyurl.com/ljjefv">http://tinyurl.com/ljjefv</a><br><br>I especially enjoyed that this was written pre-internet/electronic age as it somehow felt more "pure". Don't know quite how to explain that.

He has you do an interesting exercise where you write 10-15 of your goals in a spiral notebook every day for 30 days.  The key is you do not look at the prior day.  By the end of 30 days the ideas is that your true goals are then firmly planted in your mind.   There is also advice as to how to achieve goals which was pretty basic, but I found this to be a unique method of identifying what is important in your life.  <br><br>I think i actually got a free pdf version of the book from his site, but it also available at libraries if you want to see this part.<br><br>Gerry<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 22:29 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Liz, Beth, Gerry,<br><br>THANK YOU for all the interesting links and ideas.
