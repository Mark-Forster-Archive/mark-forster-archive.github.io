After all, it's really just another folder on my computer, and it is in a nicely accessible place. Why do I need it "clean"? What does "clean" even mean inside a computer's hard drive? As long as it has a purpose and clear boundaries, I'm fine, right?<br><br>This mostly worked, and my Desktop had only a few stale items (which I should have moved into some sort of Incubator or Someday pile), but then I switched from GTD to AF/SF. Now I have a completely different notion of "active," and I have been slinging all sorts of stuff onto the Desktop until it is now an indecipherable mess.<br><br>Related is the fact that I recently merged two old login accounts which had different organizing schemes, so my files live in several disparate "worlds" which need to be merged through some sort of painful you-gotta-be-kidding process which won't be "standing out" for me any time soon!  ;-&gt;<br><br>Still, I have this dream of file system Nirvana:<br><br>- simple-as-possible set of folders, only a few at the top level (perhaps Inbox, Incubator, Active, Reference, Closed)<br><br>- as few nested folders as possible; Active will contain a flat list of project folders, though Incubator needs useful subcategories such as Movies, Travel, etc., and perhaps inside Movies are Recommended, Classics I've Missed, etc.<br><br>- folder structure is *not* for finding stuff. I will use my computer's Search capability for that. Think of Gmail's approach: search, don't file. Smart Folders ("Saved Searches") become self-updating viewports into your world.<br><br>- folder structure reflects *meaning*; think GTD's "Organizing" principle: store things based on their meaning to you. Hence the top-level folders. Subfolders exist only if there is a valuable level of sub-meaning within the main folder; otherwise, it is a flat list of project/event folders. Set one up for "my 20 most recently accessed files"—very useful!<br><br>- a big part of this "meaning" concerns supporting SF. We want to find files that pertain to what "stands out" in C1 or what needs to be worked on in C2. We want to remember what belongs in C2 and when it needs to be written there. Yes, calendar/reminder applications factor in here. But ...<br><br>- use your computer's *file system* rather than a killer app, as much as possible. I know we are fans of Evernote, OmniFocus, etc., and you can transfer many of these concepts into your setup inside those apps. (I still have a lot of stuff in OmniFocus). But I am finding work is more and more efficient when I can mix and match my tools, when I can use standardized files (.rtf, .pdf, .csv, etc.) and work in any app that suits what I want to do. Then I use "best in class" software for each part of my workflow without worrying whether my killer app can handle XYZ files. Also, I can drag and drop the files anyplace I want, I can alias ("shortcut") them into multiple folders, I can view a folder sorted by title, date, whatever, and all *without* trying to learn how to do it a third-party app. I already know how to do it all in the file system. After all, what stinks more than my killer app's getting discontinued (Journler!), and my having to export all items and relearn everything?<br><br>- If syncing is a concern, sites like dropbox.com can help. But if mobility (iPad, etc.) is a concern, you may prefer to move this whole scheme inside Evernote et al. At least, the streamlined categories might be useful. Don't forget Simplenote and Notational Velocty, which offer value-added syncing but still work well with a flat file system, I hear.<br><br><br>There are plenty of details to work out, but I hope to go in this direction one step at a time.<br><br>Is this appealing to anyone? Do you do this already?<br>Ideas?<br><br>Thanks for your help!<br><br><br>---<br>Related threads:<br><br>Evernote?<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1439883">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1439883</a><br><br>the today list<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1431981">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1431981</a><br><br>tickler/sdmb/waiting/dismissed/calendar<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1439402">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1439402</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2011 at 3:13 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Step 1: Make a folder called Old GTD stuff<br>Step 2: Move all the desktop stuff there.<br>Tada!  Your desktop is clean! ;-)<br>Step 3: Add to SF the task "Clean out Old GTD stuff".  <br>Step 4: Develop schemes for redeploying things that come out of Old GTD stuff.<br>Step 5: Do the Clean out old GTD stuff little at a time.  Also do the scheme development little at a time.<br><br>The scheming is I think the hard part.  I am NOT an expert on this, but I will recommend one principle: Each item you file, think about how you will use that item in future.  File so as to make it easy for that future use.  I agree with your notion of search versus sort, and I'm saying to sort by how you intend to use your project materials rather than any other way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2011 at 21:19 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I must admit I file almost everything in "My Documents", in descending "date modified" order. As I'm using search to find anything, I'm not sure of the benefit of multiple folders.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2011 at 23:31 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan, that is pretty much what I'm thinking. I just need to settle on a folder structure. And yes, I love Mark's "backlog" approach. It currently has my email all spiffed up, and my physical desktop is next. The digital desktop won't make C2 for a while.  ;-&gt;<br><br>Will, we're mostly on the same page, too. The only thing I want folders/aliases for is to remind me what I'm trying to do with each item. They're really functioning as tags, such as "Pending" vs. "Archive," and I would want very few of them.<br><br>I used to have a "Print Me" folder for stuff I downloaded at a café, etc. without printer access. In the Mac OS, the std. Print dialog box has a "print to PDF" button, so if I ordered something online, I would just print the receipt to PDF and print it to paper back home. (Why print at all? Because in the family budget, we still do a lot with paper receipts.) So I will probably bring back the Print-Me folder too, but I will keep the folders as few as possible.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2011 at 8:19 | Bernie</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
