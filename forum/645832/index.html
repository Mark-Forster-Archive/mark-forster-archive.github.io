I'm wondering whetherr this task is worth doing or should I wait until I get the bathroom refitted - intended for later this year)<br>repaint iron gate ( its dark and wet outside - impossible)<br>pay credit card (its not payday til tomorrow so I have no funds to do this online. I suppose I could write a cheque and post it. It oiccurs to me I should have this as a scheduled task in my diary.  Prior to AF it was a scheduled task in my PDA with a date attached to it)<br>internet shop ( I don't need to do this for another week or two.  this could be another scheduled task, or I could just delete it and add it to the end of the list when I think it needs doing)<br>watercolour painting ( I put this on as a means to encourage me to do more leisurely things, but right now, I just don't feel like it!)<br><br>I don't want to dismiss all of these items, but I think I could dismiss one or more of them.  Is this allowed and does the system then permit me to move onto the next page? or does moving an item to a my diary count as dealing with something?  Any ideas as I have had this problem crop up on a few occasions beforein the last couple of weeks and I become paralysed with indecision!<br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2009 at 21:55 | Carole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I believe you need to dismiss them all, or none of them. Why not get those watercolours out ready for when you feel like it? That would count as working towards that task, so you can cross it out, reenter it on the last page, and move on to the next page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2009 at 22:15 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If it's not possible to do any of the tasks on the page because it's not the right time, place, or conditions, then I think the "common sense" rule would apply--just move on to the next page.

I guess from Mark's response,  the anwer is that  deleting  a task is classed as an action ( phew) as is ticking it off because its already been done.  You're saying the item stays undismissed if I don't want to action it in some way, until it is dismissed along with all the other dismissed items on the page. I get it now. So I can't cheat in those circumstances!<br><br>On reflection, I think I am trying to procrastinate dismissing items, without actually progressing them!  That *is* cheating!  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2009 at 13:30 | Carole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's funy isn't it how we tie ourselves up in knots trying to somehow cheat the system before we finally give in and say "ok, ok, I'm procrastinating!"  Regarding leaving the "to be dismissed" item until the whole page is dismissed - I tried dismissing one item on a page when there were other items outstanding but the fact that there was a highlighted item on an open page proved incredibly distracting when scanning that page and inhibited the "flow" of AF.  So much so in fact that I actually rewrote the page (sad huh?)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2009 at 13:37 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
