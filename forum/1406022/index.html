But I find these distinctions to be interpretive and subjective for the most part. In one view, a program is a collection of projects, in another sense a program is the steering towards intended outcomes. There seems to be a distinction of scope, but like the notions of Long Term and Short Term in economics, this distinction is easily misused. These definitions to me feel a bit loose, as if the model isn't really picturing what's really happening in reality as clearly as it could. And would you separate operational activities from these two categories?<br><br>Do you think Forster's classification of Continuous vs Organizational projects could be of use? Would this make for more concise definition? For example, a program could be redefined as a project focused on the establishment of continuous activities, and a project could be defined as the organization of tasks towards a finite goal.<br><br>So take this into the field, the declaration of Homeland Security as a new branch of government (Sorry to immediately put us in the throws of a political debate, I just think it's a great case study) would be considered the announcement of a program. Under my definition, the aim is to establish a dynamic set of systems whereby continuous security routines (and operational activities) are put into motion, and steered accordingly. Establishing a trapezoid in the pentagon as central headquarters would be a project. Organizationally, there are many functioning systems that need to be put in place, nonetheless there is a clear deliverable and a notion of it being on schedule.<br><br>Would you like to play with these terms a bit with me?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2011 at 14:56 | James Levine</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Watch out, because with my definition, these two types of commitments are meant to be distinct things. Although one example is "bigger" than the other, I can imagine a world where this could be the reverse. Suppose in another politically hot subject like Health Care, the US had already in place a digital medical record system. The program of a Public Health Option might have much less overhead cost and complexity-setting up Ruby on Rails or PHP (or whatever technology you'd need) to get information networked would be the easy part, although the objective is still to evaluate, establish, and reguage communication channels throughout the health care system. Putting up a new chain of Community Health Care Clinics that are part of the public health referral system would be a project, and arguably much "bigger" than the program of implementing the public health option.<br><br>The time lapsed before I could make these edits, a few sentences might better read: <br><br>"But for the most part, I find these distinctions to be interpretive and subjective.

What's the point of defining "program" here?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2011 at 15:50 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well some of us would be working in the public sector for sure, I myself have. The word "program" is used across many sectors. But the real connection for knowing what one means by "program" for the sake of getting something done is being able to manage continuous tasks, which is the point I'm making to begin with. Would you specifically suggest a different forum for this discussion?<br><br>That is, what can you learn from the DIT notion of closed lists, continuous tasks, etc and apply to program management? What other point is there for DIT to use other terms or to mean something else by the same ones? Much of what many would call time management is a means of using conversational language to talk about management science. I'm modeling this on a computer, no flash cards in the back pocket. If I can draw from a project list, and distinguish my program areas and my project areas, and have those tasks directly feed into my daily task journal, I'd say it has a lot to do with getting things done.  How 'bout someone else chime in while I remain on the sidelines?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2011 at 20:13 | James Levine</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; What do government programs have to do with getting things done? &gt;&gt;<br><br>ROFL</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2011 at 23:13 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Double Rofl for me! :-D That is indeed funny.
