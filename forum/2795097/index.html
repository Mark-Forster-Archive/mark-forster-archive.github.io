That was really helpful for me -- a real breakthrough. <br><br>I had always liked taking chaos, finding the intrinsic order, and figuring out simple ways to handle it. But I would get stuck if I couldn't find the intrinsic order right off. <br><br>Scanning / standing out made it into a much simpler, intuitive process. I could surf the chaos quite a lot longer, till a better sense of the intrinsic order would finally emerge.

The thing that matters is what we have on the list in the first place -- which comes from our commitments.

I took a sabbatical from the catholic priesthood for a year and worked as a professional mediator with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario. When I first implemented Autofocus in I think it was Feb. 2009, I was shocked that I got everything done on my plate with no effort! I had been using GTD. It was amazing. I came back as a pastor and have gone back and forth on every system Mark has developed. Now I'm back into AF2; I'm not sure what all this bouncing around means, but I'm living a good, productive and meaningful life.  Thanks largely to Mark's systems (and a bit of spirituality thrown in for good measure).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 September 2023 at 20:56 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Guess I go back to 2010, always enjoy the ideas shared here.

Prior to that I tried out DIT, coming from GTD. My problem back then was how to deal with recurring tasks in a satisfying way. The "clumping" effect of the Long List is the best solution I ever encountered for that.<br><br>So I stayed.<br><br>The best individual set-ups I had were with DWM, Ultimate TMS, PTMS, AF1 and FV, and DREAMS.<br><br>Here is why I think AF1 &gt; FVP: When you scan and something stands out, with AF1 you leverage that momentum and jump into doing that task. With FVP, you make a dot and leave.<br><br>The "thinking out loud" aspect of the community here taught me a lot in my thinking about time management. Without the forums here I would have stayed in a lot of "circular reasoning" traps a lot longer.<br><br>I do enjoy the high level of comprehension of these things that everybody here seems to have. That leads to interesting comments, that more often than not move my thinking forward. I basically read everything posted here. It's worth my time.<br><br>Most of the community systems as well as most of MF's systems and virtually all the other stuff out there: I did not even give it a go.<br><br>Reason being: I like a TMS to be elegant. I can't remember if that was one of MF's 7 prerequisites for the best TMS, but it certainly is one of mine. Something like e.g. DREAMS is enjoyable for me to use just because of that quality of elegance.<br><br>I sincerely cannot say how much MF's thinking on time management helped me. I read all his books and all his blog posts.<br><br>Two of the most important understandings are "little and often", which instilled in me the confidence to being able to tackle and complete virtually every project I could wish to endeavour in.<br><br>Another would be the establishing of routines and systems as the basis for success. This understanding has given me the stamina to not loose my nerves when engaging in longer projects and instead exercise some patience.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 September 2023 at 13:23 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I found my first comment, I think, posted in 2006 to this blog post: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2006/9/28/its-not-an-option.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2006/9/28/its-not-an-option.html</a><br><br>I can't remember how I found Mark's site, but I was (and still am) seriously into time management systems; in 2005, I'd started a new job after a long layoff, and in 2006 I was starting grad school for a mid-life masters; I remember DIT had just been published that summer and I devoured it. I remember subscribing to his newsletter when he was doing that.<br><br>In addition to all the other concepts mentioned earlier that have become part of my mental toolkit, I'd add starting on the non-urgent project now, "just get the file out," the principle of continuous revision for writing, and something I ran across in one of his seminar promotions: the hazard of saying "just one more thing." When I hear myself say that, that's a cue to STOP and go to bed.<br><br>And as silly as it may sound, the idea of the Lenten challenge.

Prior to that, I first started lurking on Mark's site and forum / getting his newsletter and using some of his methods maybe around 2006-7?  Really liked doing the spinning plates/incremental increase time method, couldn't make DIT work for me, etc.  I had been trying to shoehorn myself into timeboxing for years because it had worked when life was simpler but it just wasn't working for me and hadn't been the more my life responsibilities grew.  I had a hard time accepting limits to commitments. :-)<br><br>I still use AF in conjunction with my Hobonichi Cousin weekly page - just a bit of pre-planning done on Sundays - to do a (minor) feed into the AF list.  The AF list is run in a second book by entering items back to front using a (varied colour) highlighter to "cross off" so that I can do a "Done" list at the end of the day if wanted with time blocking for certain activities that need to be done at that time (eg. stock market open/close). I've tried other systems of Mark's and others over the years but I always come back to AF - with my own tweaks now as it seems to be the only way I can do 'little and often' interspersed with intense focused periods.  I rarely try other methods now because what I have is working -&gt; time management peace.<br><br>Mark's site and methods have been a huge help to me over the years.  This quote is from Morgan Housel and I believe it holds true: "Most successful people are just a walking anxiety disorder harnessed for productivity."  AF has been instrumental for letting go of this anxiety.  If it's on the list, it's going to get (eventually) done - or I'll admit it isn't important or interesting enough to me at this time.<br><br>Thanks for the dip into nostalgia Seraphim - hope all is going well!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 September 2023 at 16:39 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The first post on this blog was on 10 August 2006 so I guess that is how long I've been here.

I quickly found that Mark's ideas were effective simpler alternatives to all of my challenges trying to keep GTD going. <br><br>Here's some Techniques and Principles I learned here that I still use (most from Mark, but definitely developed and expanded with the active engagement from this community):<br><br>•&nbsp;Little and Often (instead of waiting for One Big Chunk Of Time)<br>• Work on as long as you want, re-write if not done, cross off the original<br>• Use a vertical line instead of a checkmark or horizontal cross-off<br>• Closed Lists<br>• Simple Scanning <br>• 5 Best Ideas (write 5 per day for 5 days, not looking at the previous day until the end)<br>• No-List (decide what's next, write it down, work on it immediately, repeat, end the day with a long crossed-off list of things you intentionally did - so many benefits)<br>• Organize by halving<br>• Sufficient, regular, focused attention<br>• "The time you spend on systems usually repays itself thousands of times over."<br>• Noguchi folder filing system (shelf of items, take out and use one, always put it back on the same end, creates a useful "recents" sorting order)<br>• How To Make Your Dreams Come True (describe your Ideal Future Self with "I" statements, then journal an imagined conversation with your Ideal Future Self every day, and that imagined self asks you What's Better Today?, and you answer and talk back and forth. Stunning how well it works.)<br>• All Three of Mark's books have novel, simple ideas that seem to get to the heart of why your current methods might not be working well. <br>• The whole ongoing experimental nature of Mark's Myriad Methods, showing how the tiniest adjustment can sometimes make a profound difference. <br>• The way Mark seems to bring an honesty to the quest for better ways of tracking and filtering and choosing and acting. Not just methods, but the principles behind them. You can't hide behind things that you want to work but that really aren't working.<br><br>Bottom line, I currently don't use any of the complete systems, but parts of them permeate my work approach every day. Hmm, I take that back. I use No-List as written. When I'm feeling like I have more than I can possibly do, and I don't even want to look at my lists, a paper No-List instantly makes me feel better. It's so intentional and realistic and in the moment. <br><br>So thank you Mark, and everyone else here who has banded together to read and try and experiment and share. I'm quite sure the ripples extend well beyond the horizon you can see.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2023 at 5:04 | Scott Moehring</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Scott - that's a great list!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2023 at 18:45 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Use a vertical line instead of a checkmark or horizontal cross-off".<br><br>Good summary.

I also never stuck with “little and often”   I will sporadically do a little of a task, but I won’t make such a task on a list to be crossed off.  If I decide it’s time to tackle something, I either complete it, or I do a’ chunk and put the rest off for another day.  I’m not saying this is more effective, I just didn’t like repeatedly logging minutia.<br><br>Moving tasks to the end of a list when work has been done is also my most consistent take away from this site, just it’s bigger chunks than Mark often has.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 October 2023 at 2:05 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>"I either complete it, or I do a chunk and put the rest off for another day"<br><br>Doing a chunk and putting the rest off for another day is "little and often".
