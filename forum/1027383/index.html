And the part that had the most effect was the L&amp;O principle. <br><br>The way I interpret L&amp;O, Avrum, the key idea is exactly as Mike Brown just expressed it. I am not saying it's easy. Even with DWM I still experience resistance to some tasks/projects that I build up in my mind as just too daunting to even get started on. But I keep telling myself, "I won't reconcile the account now, I'll just," and then, as Mike Brown said, describe some physical action. It might be get out a paper clip, or read a paragraph, or write a sentence.<br><br>For me, specifying minimal amounts of time does not work. That is, it wasn't useful to commit that I would work on this project for the next 25 minutes. That might just encourage me to delay starting it even more. What does work for me is to use Mark's idea and merely tell myself that I'll photocopy the document or do some other trivial, physical task.<br><br>I think that if there is a superior form of DWM, it would somehow be able to adjust the expiration dates, so that some tasks really would expire more frequently than once a week. But I don't know if that is necessary.<br><br>I think that there are at least 2 psychological principles that are responsible for the effectiveness of L&amp;O:<br><br>1. The Principle of Inertia<br>An object in motion tends to stay in motion. An object at rest tends to stay at rest.<br>When I am working on something, I've got that thing in motion. I tend to continue working on it. That's why I complain about interruptions. Interruptions disrupt me when I want to continue working on whatever it is I am doing.<br>When I am not working on something, I am at rest with regard to that thing. I tend to continue avoiding working on it. I need something to get me to overcome the inertia. I need something to make that something seem to me to be urgent. Expiration dates create urgency.<br><br>2. The Zeigarnik Principle<br>As loosely interpreted by me, this reminds me that I have a strong desire to get the status on tasks and projects to "complete" and I will feel some degree of suspense or discomfort as long as they remain incomplete.<br><br>With DWM, I end up working on most items at least once a week. Once I begin work, I have a tendency to continue working on them based on inertia. Once I stop work on them, I have the mild force of the Zeigarnik principle to get me started again. If Ziegarnik is not sufficient to overcome inertia, then the expiration date should be.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 February 2010 at 16:22 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Moises - great comment.

I mark the first page with open items (some page between today and +7 - simplifies the jump back to the first page). So even if my first open item is on the page some days in the future, I'll try to close that page - which means that most of the stuff gets worked on more than once a week.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 February 2010 at 18:06 | Lazy Cat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great post, moises.

Or imagine a daily newspaper which never came out because each day the editorial staff just managed to get started (again)!<br><br>I prefer Dan P's criterion. And if you're honest with yourself, you know when you've actually made process and when you've 'gamed' the system. The second path only leads to trouble in the end - it's usually better to let items drop rather than rescue them in a superficial way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2010 at 17:41 | Ed C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In the book 59 Seconds, by Richard Wiseman, there is a brief discussion of the Zeigarnik effect on pages 92-94.

In mythology Father Time is Cronus (Saturn), who devours all of his children. There is a pretty horrifying painting by Goya depicting this. One treatment for this escapism is the decision to submit to Time, if not for a long time, at least for 5 or 10 minutes with a kitchen timer. The willingness to submit can then grow. We grow in accepting our mortality, and may be more motivated to make the best of however many days we have. Buddhists are encouraged to contemplate their own finiteness in order to motivate their own efforts.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 May 2014 at 10:38 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Personally, what I do derives from the DOIT method.  ( <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com/">http://www.simple-time-management.com/</a> ).  <br><br>I think of all tasks as having an end state, and a current state, and I define the gap between the two as missing Resources.  I think of Resourses as:<br><br>Capitol (Actual physical stuff)<br>Competence (The ability and knowledge to do something)<br>Contacts (Other entities who can help you get the missing Capitol and Competence)<br><br>So the difference between where I am and where I want to be on a given task, can be thought of as missing Capitol, Competence, and Contacts.  If I get all the right Capitol, Competences, and Contacts, then I can complete the task.<br><br>Given this definition, I believe that I have done enough L&amp;O, when I can point at a Resource that I have gained.<br><br>For Example:  Say I'm working on the task "New Deck Built" for my back yard.  <br><br>I dot the task and I "get the folder out" that has all my plans in it.  - Is that enough?  What resource did I get?  The Folder?  No.  I already HAD the folder, so not enough.<br><br>I open the folder and review my plans thus far.  - Is that enough?  What resource did I get?  Nothing that I didn't have already, so not enough.<br><br>I then realize that I have no idea what needs to be done next (probably why I've been resisting this task).  So I decide that the next thing I need to do is get expert advice.  I had already picked out a contractor, and his business card is in the folder.  I get his business card out.  - Is that enough?  What resource did I get?  Again, I already had the business card, and I gained no additional knowledge or ability to do anything.<br><br>So I call the contractor and set up an appointment with him for this friday at 2:00 pm to discuss my options. - Is that enough?  What resource did I get?  I got an APPOINTMENT.  The state of the "New Deck Built" project has advanced by one appointment.  Sure, it's not leaps and bounds, but it is undeniably progress.  I cross the task off, and re-enter it on my list.<br><br>In short, for me the minimum amount of work on a task is the amount of work necessary to gain a resource that I did not have previously, no matter how small that resource.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 June 2014 at 19:29 | Miracle</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My bare minimum (responding to the original question) is wether I have made a substantial thought on the subject.  This corespondece to the "process" step in GTD.  Normally, once such a processing thought step is made, I can re-enter the task with a better wording.  I made a step towards "clarifying the outcome" in GTD terminology.<br><br>Here is an example from my current list:  originally I wrote "sort out ye olde browser bookmarks" and after skipping this task a couple of times it wandered to the forefront of my brain and today when I was bookmarking a page I had a little epiphany or better yet, made a deicision in my gut and the next time I saw the task on the list I re-entered it as "implement DWM-like browser bookmarks structure".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 June 2014 at 23:39 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Miracle and Christopher:<br><br>I think both of  you are missing the point of "little and often".<br><br>What you should be aiming for is repeated bursts of work which are small enough not to cause resistance. In the case of a high resistance project, the first few bursts may need to be very small indeed in order to reduce resistance sufficiently.<br><br>In fact they may be so small that they have no other effect than to reduce resistance. For instance in Maurer's "One Small Step Can Change Your Life" he describes a case of getting a client to take regular exercise. The first step was to stand on her treadmill (without switching it on) for a few minutes each day. When she'd done that for a week, she was allowed to switch the treadmill on. From then on it was upwards all the way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 June 2014 at 1:42 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good point, Mark.  I find that there are often situations when I feel that I have done enough on a task when I do little more than rewrite it at the end of my FV list.  It may be that I simply do not feel interiorly ready to do more than this.  Or the weather makes the task unsuitable to do today and putting it at the end of the list at least freshens it up for action at a more suitable time.  Even very tiny gestures at least keep the project alive and within my field of vision.  If I "often" take a quick look at a project, at least I prevent it from dying or going completely off my radar.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 June 2014 at 3:01 | Jim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just taking out the folder leaves me with a folder to put away, so that creates more work than it accomplishes. In addition, the time I spent taking out the folder could have been spent doing something more productive.<br><br>Taking it out and reassuring myself that things are going well with that project might be worth the time spent taking out and putting away the folder. So might a final check to confirm that yes, I can safely hibernate the project, or deciding on a better home for the folder (archive or easier to get out or in-my-face), or dividing or combining folders, or reorganizing it so my next check will be more productive. At the extreme, the act of taking it out might create so much resistance that I know I need to investigate the resistance rather than keep bashing away at the project, and that insight is definitely worth the work of taking out and putting away the folder.<br><br>Miracle, that's a neat way of looking at it.<br><br>Christophe, yep, older bookmarks are good candidates for deletion more often than not.<br><br>Overall, I find little-and-often needs to be done in moderation. I prefer to make good progress on a few projects, and let the others sleep, rather than have many projects all getting just enough attention to compete for more. DWM won't let them sleep. In moderation, though, little-and-often rocks! The few projects that I apply it to get done (at least until they get bumped by another project).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 June 2014 at 17:24 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cricket:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Just taking out the folder leaves me with a folder to put away, so that creates more work than it accomplishes. In addition, the time I spent taking out the folder could have been spent doing something more productive. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Well, again you are missing the point. Whether it creates more work or whether the time could have been spent more productively is entirely irrelevant. The point is that it is softening up your resistance to a task or project which you are finding it difficult to get started on. So it is not a choice between getting the folder out or doing something else more productive. It is a choice between taking steps to get moving on an important project which you are resisting or else continuing to ignore it and doing something easier instead.<br><br>In Maurer's example of the women who had to stand on a treadmill for a few minutes a day for a week, it would appear that she had accomplished precisely nothing. Think of all the things she could have done in those minutes - and she would have had to put the treadmill away each time too!<br><br>Yet this action eventually let to her taking regular exercise every day - something she had consistently failed to do for years.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 June 2014 at 23:01 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cricket:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I find little-and-often needs to be done in moderation.

If you have to be working for 38 days to clear an email backlog, it seems to me that you might just as well have tackled the email when it first came in - and the same for all the other backlogs.<br><br>As a little and often aficionado, I have currently a total of 2 emails in my inbox, zero paper in my in-tray and zero neglected projects. Backlogs simply don't exist for me. And because I clear projects quickly I don't have to worry about having too many going on at once.

Or didn't you write something about progressive revision?  I don't recall if you called it progressive revision.

Each successive revision built on, and added value (and likely volume) to the previous revisions.<br><br>So to be clear, I have two concepts in my mind now:  <br><br>Little and Often (L&amp;O) - which is getting the folder out or standing on the treadmill for a few minutes for the purpose of wearing down resistance.  This is the Little and Often that Mark has been writing about.<br><br>What I'll call Incremental Appreciation (IA) - which is making appreciable progress (as in "increase in value," not "progress that you're grateful for" per se) on one tiny increment at a time.  This is what I previously thought Mark had meant by L&amp;O.<br><br>In the end, I find great use for both of these.  IA naturally feels (at least, to me) more like a criteria for having "worked on a task enough" per virtually all of Mark's systems.  Hence, it is my answer to the question posed in this post.  But I use a series of tiny L&amp;O tasks to get me to that smallest appreciable increment.  <br><br>"I'm not going to set an appointment with the contractor, I'll just get the project folder out."<br><br>... Though in writing this - I find note an inconsistency in my reasoning above that could be what Mark has been trying to tell us.  <br><br>So Mark:  Is L&amp;O, as you've been writing it, defined by not only the innocuous task itself (eg: "Stand on the treadmill for a few min a day"), but also defined by the length of time between each such task?  In other words "Standing on the treadmill" is the "Little" part of L&amp;O.  But let's say it were immediately followed by "Walk 5 paces on the lowest setting", and then, "Okay fine, I'll walk 5 more this time but then I'm done for today."  Would that constitute "Often"?  Or did you more have in mind, "Stand on the treadmill," and then the exact same task again after a day had passed?<br><br>I'm probably analyzing this too far into the details, (I tend to do that) so thanks for your patience with me.  This matter will trouble my thoughts until I come to my own conclusion.  And I assure you that I WILL come to my own conclusion in due time (that I also do), but your perspective, and the perspective of the Get Everything Done community, would mean a lot to me while puzzle it out.<br><br>Thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 June 2014 at 3:30 | Miracle</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting post.  <br><br>Miracle, I see 'I'll just get the file out' as being a specific tool in the toolkit that is 'Little and Often'.<br><br>My understanding is that Mark's idea of 'I'll just get the file out' is a tool for beating resistance to a daunting task or project: taking out a file is easy and non-threatening; it is the tiniest baby-step towards that daunting task or project.   Then once the file is out and you take a look at it, you have the option to do some actual work on it.  You may still be scared to take that option, but you could then tell yourself 'I'll just read through the first few pages'.  You may end up doing a substantial amount of work on it just be sneaking up on it in baby-steps. The hope is that you'll then have broken some of the resistance to actioning the task next time you come to it, and will be able to work on it 'little and often' if that's appropriate to the task.  <br><br>So just standing on the treadmill without walking wasn't the point of the exercise (excuse the pun) - the point is to find an easy and non-threatening baby-step that will hopefully lead to the desired result, and in this case it worked very well.<br><br>Most tasks and projects with a specific deadline are better achieved by using 'Little and Often' rather than waiting until the deadline is looming (e.g. organising yourself so that you practise playing the piano for about 20 minutes a day rather than for 2 hours on the day of your next lesson).  This applies whether it is an enjoyable task/project or a daunting one.  If it is a daunting one, you can apply 'I'll just get the file out' tool (in this case, I'll just sit on the piano stool for 2 minutes' - and very likely you'll end up doing some practice).<br><br>That's my understanding of it - hope this helps.<br><br>Best wishes to all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 June 2014 at 10:54 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Miracle:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Ah - So Little and Often, as you intended it, is the same as "Get the Folder Out." &gt;&gt;<br><br>No, that's not right, any more than if I said running is the same as exercise, or Bollinger is the same as champagne. "Get the folder out" is one specific application of "Little and often", just as standing on a treadmill is one specific application of kaizen - small steps.<br><br>There also seems to be a misunderstanding that "I'm not going to write that report now, but I'll just get the file out" is a true statement. In fact it's a lie, intended to trick the non-rational fear-producing part of your brain into lifting the resistance that you feel to the task. The idea is that once you've got the file out you will probably continue working on the report and get a lot more done than just getting the file out.<br><br>Another application of the same principle which I have often quoted is that you shouldn't make it your goal to go for a three-mile run every morning; you should make it your goal to stand outside your front door wearing your running kit. And if some mornings that's all you do, then well and good because most mornings once you're standing outside in your running kit the natural thing to do is to go for a run.<br><br>Anyway, Margaret1 has summed it up very well so read her post too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 June 2014 at 19:01 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>38 days was the longest the backlog could possibly take with the 10% rule. In 8 days, I'm down to only . 300 active email is unusual for me. That was after several months of resisting pretty much everything. (Biennial physical is next week. Little step there will be discussing anti-depressants. This winter was the worst in years. Dropped several of the habits that I know make a difference.)<br><br>In my the last 10 days of little-and-often, I've reviewed and archived 220 emails (plus many more that got dealt with before the end-of-day count), 4 more inches of various paper backlogs (down to 12 inches), confirmed that all 20 teachers have made samples and will give me what I need by the publication deadline, dropped my reliance on the melody line for four pieces for my exam, brought 6 technical exercises up to getting 2nd try (starting from not a chance), same with 10 intervals (we won't talk about major and minor 6ths).<br><br>Little and often does work for me, but not if Little is so small that the step has more overhead than progress, or if I split it between too many projects. Just turning on the piano is such a waste of time that I won't do it. Just turning it on and doing my warmups is worth doing, and I usually stay at it, and focused, for 30 minutes. Just picking up the phone to call the teacher I'm most worried about is enough to open the file, and then I go on to check on two other teachers.<br><br>You're right, I do resist steps if they're too little. When I'm resisting everything, then I also resist tricks to get me moving. When I'm in the mood to get things done, I'm drawn to things that will show progress, which means a larger step than you recommend.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 June 2014 at 21:25 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cricket:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I'm drawn to things that will show progress, which means a larger step than you recommend.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Let's be clear that when I'm talking about "little and often" that is contrasted with "saving it all up and trying to do it all in one huge go, usually at the last minute". <br><br>"Little" is a relative term. If we are talking about a concert pianist "little" might be four or five hours practice a day.<br><br>I don't recommend any particular size step for "little". All I am saying is that it's better to do a tiny step than no step at all.<br><br>Also I only recommend working "little and often", or indeed working at all, on one's *active* projects. It's up to you to decide which projects to make active at any one time. And you will obviously take many factors into consideration when making that decision, of which one of the most important is the amount of time you have available to work on them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 June 2014 at 22:01 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, Margaret1,<br><br>So based on your feedback, the answer to my question is clear to me.<br><br>I asked if several little "Get the Folder Out" (GTFO) tasks in rapid succession would itself constitute "Little and Often" (L&amp;O).  And the answer from both of you is "No."  To illustrate:  If I wanted to study for an exam, (a task I resist with great zeal) I would use a succession of GTFO tasks to trick my Lizard Brain into studying.  <br><br>"I won't study - I'll just get my textbook out."<br>"I won't study - I'll just get my lecture notes out."<br>"I won't study - I'll just check the syllabus to see which chapters the exam covers."<br>"I won't study - I'll just remind myself what Ch. 1 was about by skimming my lecture notes."<br>...And so on...<br><br>I wanted to know if this rapid succession would count as L&amp;O.  If I read your answers correctly, then the above DOES count as L&amp;O in the sense that GTFO is an application of L&amp;O.  However, the above would NOT count as L&amp;O if I did all these GTFO actions ON THE MORNING OF THE EXAM.  For the above to count as L&amp;O, I would have to take the above GTFO actions repeatedly (eg: daily) during the weeks prior to the exam.  This gives me the definition of "Often" that I hoped to ascertain by asking my question.  "Successive" does not equal "Often."<br><br>So I now understand L&amp;O as:<br><br>1) "Little" = a small task.  This includes both tasks which accomplish some incremental progress toward the overall goal, which Cricket and I prefer (eg: 10% of a backlog), and tasks which erode resistance by accomplishing nothing of consequence (eg: GTFO).  The bare minimum is the latter of the two.  Hence the answer to the original question of this thread is a GTFO action - just as Mark stated.<br><br>2) "Often" = frequently.  This means periods of working on the task, separated by periods of not working on the task, for a sufficient number of repetitions to have eroded all resistance AND accomplished the overall goal, or at least appreciable progress toward it.<br><br>Have I hit the nail on the head this time, or am I still bruising my thumb?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 June 2014 at 13:03 | Miracle</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sounds good to me. I think the types of LAO serve two different purposes. GTFO erodes resistance. Incremental progress maintains momentum.<br><br>Often, for me, works out to any weekday that doesn't have appointments. That's enough to not break the chain. More than once a day gives me burnout.
