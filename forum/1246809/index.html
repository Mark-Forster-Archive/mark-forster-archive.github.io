Stop adding to the problem. Take care of all incoming stuff right away without adding to the pile. Then start eating away at the backlog a little at a time.  <br><br>I was thinking though, what if you apply this method to your entire household at once?  Will it work or is it better to just focus on one thing at a time?  Does this physical backlog work like AF1 where if you finish one area it's gone, or like AF4 where if you finish a backlog you get a new one?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2010 at 22:47 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I believe it's maintenance more then a project unless it's WAY out of control.<br>It will come back when you notice it and then you will right it in AF be it 1 or 4.<br><br>I like the physical idea reflecting the AF system.<br>AF being made of a sophisticated list is essentially a Bucket.<br>So there is no reason your house cannot be compared to it because it IS a physical bucket.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2010 at 0:39 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If I treated each room as a closed list, (though many don't need much work) then I could go around and work on any.  But if I get busy and things accumulate.  How exactly does this work?  Where does new stuff go in the event I fail to keep up? Add to the existing "pile"?  Create a second pile?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2010 at 3:43 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>I'm working on this very problem right at the moment. My office has got into a state of disarray and I've had to "declare a backlog" on keeping the office tidy. <br><br>What this means is that I've cleared two surfaces, and these are now the only places where I put anything once I've been working with it. I have a recurring task "Tidy Office" which refers only to these two surfaces (for the moment). Every time I do this task I make sure that I put everything on these surfaces back into their proper place (or allocate a proper place if it's a new item).<br><br>At the same time I swept all the other stuff which needed tidying into a heap on the floor. I have another recurring task "Tidy Office Backlog". When I do this task, I work on the heap for as long as I feel like it. As a result it's quite quickly getting smaller.<br><br>Once I've finished the heap, the "Tidy Office Backlog" task will be discontinued and the "Tidy Office" task will include the whole office.<br><br>If you can't keep up with the new stuff, then you need to revise your system for dealing with new stuff. Are you clearing it often enough? Has everything got a place to go? Why is there so much? etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2010 at 12:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here is Leo Babauta's take on this...<br>When de-cluttering better go in reverse:<br><br>What you do is instead of looking at each thing in turn<br>asking if it's of worth or not,<br>create a big dumping "Box" (throw EVERYTHING out).<br>Clean up the place and your ready to go.<br>From that box, take back the few vitals that you know you need.<br>The rest stays in the box.<br><br>Determine an elimination date when you will really<br>get rid of the "box" and it's content (Ã  la DWM).<br><br>Now, when you need something that's in the box, just take it out<br>and when you are finished with it, place it at a good place.<br><br>When the limit date arrives, throw the box and everything out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2010 at 13:26 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So nice to get your input, Mark.  That response makes it seem so clear now.<br>Erik, I haven't got the same courage or drive that Leo has.  I couldn't take an unsorted pile of papers and dump it.  I have no problem going through a pile and dumping 2/3rds, but 1/3 I would like to keep.<br><br>It's not "important" stuff, so I wouldn't miss it.  I will never *need* any of it.  But if I dumped it all, that 1/3 I wish to keep would be lost.  I feel life is better when I can look at good stuff occasionally.  Like I did yesterday.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2010 at 23:09 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't like dumping all the backlog into one big pile. Yes, that's how GTD does it, but that doesn't mean it's right.<br><br>Even though the backlog pile isn't perfectly organized, it still has some organization, and it's one you're used to. By dumping everything into one pile you lose that. It goes from "probably somewhere on the third shelf" to "somewhere in the pile that covers half the office".<br><br>One of Spider Robinson's Callahan books talks about packing for a move. Start in one corner and pack. That's faster and less stressful than trying to purge and organize during the rushed side of the move, and you can let friends do it. At the new place, if you need something from a box that hasn't been emptied yet, you'll probably remember where it was in the old house, and hence which box it's in.<br><br>GTD anticipates two or three full days organizing the big pile it creates. I don't have that much uninterrupted time, and even if I did I'd be making very bad decisions by the end of it.<br><br>I like boxes with "throw out on" dates, but not as general dumping grounds. I evaluate each thing as it goes in. Receipts for small things get filed by month, and I throw them out after a year. Stuff I can't decide about, or that the kids aren't ready to give up, I label "review after". Often sitting in a box for a year is proof I don't need it any more, but sometimes seeing it again makes me smile so much that I decide to keep it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2010 at 16:22 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree a series of closed "piles" is much better than one biggie.  GTD's all or nothing approach is troublesome to those who fail to achieve the All Done state.  Stitl, when it comes to paperwork, you can lose a lot of time searching for stuff.  You can lose more than time if you fail to search for the right stuff.  So for that kind of thing, it's best to get going quickly.  Most other kinds of things are much less urgent.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 October 2010 at 17:41 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find there's a balance between time spent filing and time spent looking.<br><br>I have a resistance to filing. If it's too time-consuming I end up with a useless pile. Also, filing breaks my train of thought when doing other things.<br><br>The big picture is necessary. It makes no sense spending hours filing papers in the exact right place if you rarely need them. Likewise, if you often need to get pages from a file you want to find them quickly.<br><br>I use the "half-inch" rule when filing.<br><br>When the "to file" pile is over half an inch, "Filing" is added as a task in AF. I'm thinking of putting it on maintenance / automatic repeat.<br><br>If a file is less than half an inch thick, I don't bother sorting the papers within it.<br><br>If the file is larger, I divide it into smaller files (by year usually works well, or by 5 years). The only time I bother to sort finer than that is at year-end, When I have all 12 statements, it only takes a minute or two to put them in order and clip.<br><br>Half an inch seems the magic number for most files. Much larger and it gets frustrating to search through. Much smaller and maintenance takes more time than searching.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 October 2010 at 20:17 | Cricket</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
