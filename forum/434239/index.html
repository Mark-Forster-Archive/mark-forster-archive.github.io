Clearly I can't action all of those at the same time, and certainly not in one day.  With typically 2 or 3 such meetings a week, what should I be doing to keep on top of things.  I delegate as much as I can, but am still ending up with a constant 'backlog'.  <br><br>The simplistic answer is I have too many commitments and need to cut down, but I don't think that's the real issue.  There is a more fundamental issue here of long term project tracking, and how this is dealt with, or not, within the GED methodology.  If it's not, does Mark have any resources which might help me, and how does this mesh with the GED method?<br><br>All thoughts and suggestions gratefully received!<br><br>Thanks <br>Adrian</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 May 2008 at 14:20 | Adrian P</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Adrian,<br><br>I understand your concerns, and as you have seen my multiple posts here, I have also struggled with many aspects of the DIT system.  I love the simplicity and basic ideas.  I fully understand that if one cannot clear their closed list within a 3-4 day average, then they have too many commitments. And this is correct, but for so many of us, this cannot and will not change!  I cannot change the level of commitments I have in my work, and as a very busy professor with multiple grants, students, teaching, service commitments at my university (there are now some large ones -- I am the new Vice President of our Faculty Senate). SO I guess it is just not bothering me that much anymore.  I have my next actions listed for today in Outlook 2007 and structured as tasks starting today.  I do the best in not adding too many new tasks -- I have gotten much better at deciding if new things coming my way truly have to be done today -- or can they simply be put on tomorrow's list.<br><br>My advice is to use some type of project tracking software and only add tasks that are truly active and need to be done within the next couple of weeks to your acitve task diary. Mark has commented before that complex project plans may have hundreds of tasks there, but they all do not need to be entered into your active task diary for the next day -- that certainly does not make any sense.<br><br>A number of us should continue this discussion on this forum as this is important.  Many of us are folks who have come over from the GTD system.  I have noticed over the past few weeks that this forum has been too quiet.  These are important issues, and Mark -- please enter into these conversations again -- these are real-life issues with some very busy people and we are all seeking advice.<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 May 2008 at 15:02 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David - congratulations on your new role!  I guess neither of us are *really* too busy to be posting messages on web boards?!<br><br>Have you read MF's other book "Get Everything Done and Still have Time to Play"?

No, I have not read Mike's other book, but perhaps that is one I should do so.  But he himself has commented that these books are not necessarily linked in a series, and that there may be some conflicting ideas between the two -- maybe that is not correct, but I think somewhere on this forum that has been discussed that there seems to be a disconnect between the current DIT and the GED book.<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 May 2008 at 16:12 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David<br><br>Congratulations on your new post!<br><br>I don't really have much to add on the subject of having too much work. I've already written elsewhere that if one is successfully giving all one's commitments the time and attention they deserve then there is no problem. If one is not then presumably some are getting done well, some not so well and some not at all. <br><br>This means that you are not doing all the work anyway. The question then is what criteria you are using to decide what to do well, what to do badly and what not to do at all.<br><br>Don't forget that there are two other aspects to look at if you can't get through all your work: 1) whether you are working efficiently, and 2) whether you are leaving enough time.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2008 at 13:28 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>My original question was to do with how one deals with multiple actions generated from a meeting, which don't need to all be done the next day, and will probably cover a period of 2 - 3 months.  I'd value any thoughts or suggestions you could offer in that scenario?<br><br>Thanks<br>Adrian</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2008 at 20:33 | Adrian P</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Adrian, good question...There does generally appear to be some tension between the effective and easy to implement DIT system and tracking project 'actions' or tasks as in the more complicated GTD system. I too would appreciate any tips!<br><br>In reference to your query would it be practical to make a note in your task diary to review the project in a few months time in order to prompt you to do the tasks then? Otherwhise could you get going on the tasks 'tommorrow' so they get done before they become urgent as Mark frequently suggests.  <br><br>Leon.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 May 2008 at 12:04 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Leon,<br><br>Thanks for your reply - much appreciated.<br><br>Putting reminders in the task diary is a good idea, and I do do that to some extent.  I'm not convinced that its the best way to track everything I have to do though.  <br><br>I have 10 - 15 specific projects on the go at work at any given time, varying in timescale from 6 months to about 5 years (I'm a consultant engineer and spend most of my time managing design teams and providing specialist advice to architects and other building designers, as well as some business and staff development.  At home, I have a young family and am a leader in my church so my personal life isn't quiet either!)  The number of committments is a common scenario for those in my profession so reducing my workload isn't really an option or I will be unemployable!  It's not really necessary either - I can manage the amount of work, and enjoy the variety, it's just keeping track of it all that's a problem.<br><br>5 or 6 of those projects will typically be most active at the same time whilst the others are a little more relaxed.  The active ones will require some input pretty much every day, some more than one action per day.  <br><br>I think a task diary is a good way to track short term actions, by which I mean those measured in days or weeks.  The issue is that I need a way to track mulitple longer term actions, over say the 2 - 3 months I mentioned in my original post, and those actions, deliverables and key decision points several years ahead, AND I need to do that for multiple projects.  As far as I can see from the book, DIT doesn't deal with that scenario or anything approaching it, even in the chapter on 'Projects'.  I'm starting to think that maybe I've got the wrong book, and that the DIT methods aren't appropriate for me or those with similar professions?  <br><br>I'm still open to ideas!!!<br><br>Thanks<br>Adrian</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 May 2008 at 16:09 | Adrian P</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Adrian:<br><br>I'm not sure why you regard the Task Diary as not being a good way to track actions over 2-3 months. My task diary still has space for actions for the next seven months, and I'll be buying a new one long before the year is out. All you have to do is enter actions for each project in the Task Diary under the dates they fall due.<br><br>If you feel that this is too simple and want another level of complication, then there's nothing to stop you opening a document (Word, outliner, mindmap, etc) in which you list all your projects and the future actions, reviews, etc., with dates for each project. Review this document weekly or monthly to ensure that all the upcoming dates have in fact been entered in the Task Diary.<br><br>You will have gathered from my slightly sarcastic tone that I don't necessarily think that this additional document would be an improvement. This is because in my experience it's easy to end up spending more time  running the system than doing the work, and making things more complicated usually only gives an illusion of better control.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 May 2008 at 16:55 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Adrian:<br><br>In answer to your original question:<br><br>If you have 2 or 3 meetings a week which are generating large numbers of tasks then, assuming you are working a 5 day week, you only have two days on average in which to action *all* the tasks coming out of each meeting. <br><br>In this case, the easiest way to keep track of the tasks is to do all the ones you can do immediately, and to put the ones you can't do immediately in the Task Diary for when you can do them.<br><br>I'm sure if I think hard I will be able to come up with a more complicated way of doing it!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 May 2008 at 17:26 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Perhaps it would be a better use of your time to think about how sarcastic public responses to your customers and potential future customers genuine queries affects your business.

My experience is that adding further documents simply means that you are spending more time on the system and less time doing the work.<br><br>I gave a suggestion if you felt you needed further control, but emphasized that I did not personally think that it would be an improvement.<br><br>I'm sorry if my pathetic attempts at humour offended you.

Yes, it is only for people using Outlook, but his principles of dealing with multiple next actions and those just over the horizon are innovative and interesting.  Mark, have you per chance read this new book?

I really like some of his ideas and approaches and, for the most part, are not outside the structure of DIT.  I really would like to hear your assessment of his system.<br><br>Thanks!<br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 November 2008 at 23:43 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>What I proposed in my free ebook Simple Time Management was a four section spiral notebook.  Sectioned for Results (Projects), Actions, which could be used like a task diary, Owed, which is a list of things people owe you and lastly notes.  As you take notes in a meeting you use a RA or O in the margins to remind you of new Results, Action Items and Owed you items.  You can then review the notes and transfer the action items to the Action Items section of the notebook or just use the notes as a reminder and do them.  It is simple and everything is in one place.   The only draw back is that unless you go and date future pages you can't schedule ahead. <br><br>I personally prefer to have a list of the things people owe me in one place instead of spread out on future task diary pages.  For me it makes it easier to scan the list and send off an email reminder or make a phone call to get something.<br><br>Additionally, you could just use this method to take notes and keep the notes and cross off the items once they go into the task diary.  Even if you use pure DIT, I think Mark acknowledges that project planning may require additional resources beyond the tak diary, but I will let him speak to that.<br><br>So far I have not received any feedback to see if anyone else is having any success with this method which is a hybrid of DIT and GTD and a couple of my own ideas.<br><br>It is available for free here.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a><br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2008 at 4:23 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;I think Mark acknowledges that project planning may require additional resources beyond the tak diary, but I will let him speak to that.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Indeed, as I've said before many times, I make a distinction between managing a project and managing yourself within the project. The first is the preserve of Project Management and the second is the preserve of Time Management. These are two separate disciplines. If you buy a book on Project Management you will find its contents are quite different from a book on Time Management. It's important not to confuse the two.<br><br>To take an extreme case, if you were in charge of building a bridge from the British mainland to the Isle of Wight, you would need a vast amount of Project Planning which would co-ordinate the activities of thousands of people.<br><br>Some of those activities would relate to you yourself, i.e. the actions you personally have to take as the manager of the project. It's those activities which your own Time Management system will address.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2008 at 10:32 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David:<br><br>No I haven't read it yet.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2008 at 10:39 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
