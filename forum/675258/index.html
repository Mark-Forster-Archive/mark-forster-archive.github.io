I certainly couldn't be called an AF purist at this stage.<br><br>Yesterday I got pummeled by clients who had problems and questions and requests beyond the norm.  I am a software developer, and supporting my customers is part of what I do, but the demands of this aspect vary hugely and are quite unpredictable.  I ran the gauntlet, invoking the common sense do ti immediately rule, and didn't even open my AF book.<br><br>Today, on the other hand, I spent almost the whole day on the one task.  It was something I had entered in my book about a week ago, and today was its day.  I had to move a whole lot of programming code on order to standardise all editions of my software.  I knew it was going to be a big job.  For stuff like that, little and often doesn't work for me as well as get stuck in and plod through until it's done.  I didn't open my AF book until late afternoon.<br><br>Why am I telling you this?  Well, I'm not too worried... basically I've had a couple of pretty productive days, and I feel satisfied.  But I would like to get into a bit of a flow as a AF user, and I don't feel that so far.  How can I, with days like that?  Anybody have parallel work commitments?  Anyone got ideas or comments of how you manage the chunky and the unpredictable?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 8:18 | Steve Schapel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Steve<br><br>My discretionery time varies immensely with the result that some days I cannot get to my lists at all.  I had concerns that I was not moving through the lists quickly enough or that things would be missed, but at the end of the day I do feel productive and do not feel worried by my somewhat erratic progress.<br><br>The way I "manage" AF with erratic discretionery time is by using the following:<br><br>1) Ensure I know what is in my lists in case I don't get through them all in a day<br><br>2) Ensure I have a good system to facilitate overview (in my case my schedule and my project system)<br><br>3) Check my schedule regularly<br><br>4) Check forum daily (this keeps me in the AF mindset) I try to do this at least morning and evening as a general routine<br><br>5) Use small blocks of discretionery time wisely - even 10 minutes can be productive.  If at my PC I may use those 10 minutes to check the forum, check email, or review my lists.  If away from my desk to brainstorm ideas or jot down tasks in a notebook.  Alternatively if you have the chance in that time to do a few AF tasks just do them, even if you are not on that page! <br><br>At the end of the day chunky and unpredictable tasks are just that, chunky and unpredictable.  It is unlikely you can deal with the tasks in any other way. However you CAN manage the systems if there is a pattern to the type of task.  If you find the same type of task recurring, and you can create or enhance a system for dealing with that type of task, then the management of such eventualities can be made easier. <br><br>It sounds as if AF is working just fine .......</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 9:00 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Steve<br>I, personally don't worry about it.  I find when I'm able to work on certain type of projects in large chunks (or do it all), I'm FAR MORE proficient rather than chunking. If any sort of deadline has teeth aimed at your arse, it should be on the calendar  Also, I do a quick check of my messages to make sure nobody is stuck by the side of the road or is in the emergency room?  Otherwise, backing up a few bottom up tasks for a couple of days is a profitable trade off for knocking out a huge or important project.......just my 2cents <br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 1:14 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Christine and Learning.  Your comments have helped me.<br><br>Learning, sounds like you would also understand how sometimes you don't need to scroll through the tasks in the book to know which one "stands out"... it's the one that was on your mind when you woke up in a cold sweat at 3am. :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 6:59 | Steve Schapel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Steve<br>ROTFLMAO!  LOL!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Even before my disabilities, I'd scrawl reminders in huge letters across my bathroom mirror and for good measure, tape an additional reminder on the frig door!  LOL!  I figure that I visit these areas far more often than I check my calendar!  Now I can blame it on my pain issues and memory loss!  LOL!  LOL!  LOL!  When I was a medical artist, the doctors were notorious for submitting work for publication deadlines and medical conventions at the last minute.  That's where I made the huge bucks because I could pull 48hour "dashes" to accomodate them.....and I told them up front that they will PAY DEARLY for infringing on my off hours time!.....Sometimes even other medical illustrators would pay me to do their work because they couldn't meet deadlines in time!................YES, I know well the cold sweats and those teeth biting at my arse.  I earned the reputation as the "11th hour artist"......surely not fun, but highly profitable!  Confession:  I learned the skill by how I handled my school work blended with riding the wave of natural inspirations. It's ironic that what my professors warned me against became the best money and reputation producing traits!<br>See?  It's all perspective!  LOL!<br>My advice?  Whether it's inspiration or naked fear, ride the wave and leave the lesser stuff in it's wake!  I do hope you're being properly paid to take on their slacking it!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 14:09 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>There's another fabulous use for this method.  If you hate a certain assignment badly enough, just put your shoulder into it like it's due NOW!  Then, put the completed project aside and submit it only one or two days before the deadline to give the illusion that you actually NEEDED all that time to do it.  You don't want people to think that this frantic pace is you "set point" for working!  LOL!  Otherwise, they'll slack even worse and demand even more!  I learned this the hard way early in my career.  Plus, there's the added benefit of it not floating around in your head haunting you like a banshee!  The third benefit is that the time you freed up becomes time for things of your own choosing.....just don't get caught!  LOL!  LOL!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 14:28 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Steve<br><br>"you don't need to scroll through the tasks in the book to know which one "stands out"... it's the one that was on your mind when you woke up in a cold sweat at 3am. :)"  I can so relate to that.  The great thing is that that is happening less and less since starting AF<br><br>learning as I go<br><br>That is an excellent point about not submitting work too early.  It is precisely because someone IS good at what they do that they deserve recognition for that skill, not for how easy they find it or how much more quickly they can do the task in.  If someone sees you do something in 10 minutes they think it is easy.  Never mind that you had to train for 10 years to gain that skill, or that it would take them 10 hours to even understand what you had done.<br><br>You've probably seen the following story but I still think it is a classic :-<br><br>There was once a giant ship engine that failed. The ship's owners tried one expert after another, but none of them could figure but how to fix the engine. Then they brought in an old man who had been fixing ships since he was a youngster. He carried a large bag of tools with him,  and when he arrived, he immediately went to work. <br><br>He inspected the engine very carefully, top to bottom. Two of the ship's owners were there, watching this man, hoping he would know what to do. After looking things over, the old man reached into his bag and pulled out a small hammer. He gently tapped something. Instantly, the engine lurched into life. He carefully put his hammer away. The engine was fixed! <br><br>A week later, the owners received a bill from the old man for ten thousand dollars.<br><br>"What?!" the owners exclaimed. "He hardly did anything!"<br><br>So they wrote the old man a note saying, "Please send us an itemized bill." <br><br>The man sent a bill that read:<br><br>Tapping with a hammer ............................ $             2.00<br>Knowing where to tap  ......................... $       9998.00 <br><br>Says it all!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 15:43 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Tapping with a hammer ............................ $ 2.00<br>Knowing where to tap ......................... $ 9998.00<br><br>The story itself...................................... Priceless!<br><br>That was hilarious!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 20:25 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi all<br>Of course this lesson was learned through an artist's experience......<br><br>Legend has it that Pablo Picasso was sketching in the park when a bold woman approached him.<br><br>“It’s you — Picasso, the great artist! Oh, you must sketch my portrait! I insist.”<br><br>So Picasso agreed to sketch her. After studying her for a moment, he used a single pencil stroke to create her portrait. He handed the women his work of art.<br><br>“It’s perfect!” she gushed. “You managed to capture my essence with one stroke, in one moment. Thank you! How much do I owe you?”<br><br>“Five thousand dollars,” the artist replied.<br><br>“B-b-but, what?” the woman sputtered. “How could you want so much money for this picture? It only took you a second to draw it!”<br><br>To which Picasso responded, “Madame, it took me my entire life.”<br><br>This story guided me through my young years as my professors chided me for working quickly and going on to something else.  They'd want to behead me when I retorted:  I got my perfect grade satifying what you want of me.  Now I'll use my time to what I want of me!  LOL!  I painted for excellence for grades or money.  I painted for reverie of discovery, learning and self-expression for myself!  The results could "look" quite similar but the experiences being worlds apart!  It's hard to explain. <br>learning as I go<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 23:04 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>learning as I go<br><br>"The results could "look" quite similar but the experiences being worlds apart!"

No, Christine you wouldn't want to.  One thing that has ALWAYS galled me since I was quite young was if I put a fire under my butt to get my work done fast, if I wasn't compliant and cheerful, I had a "bad attitude"  My question asked ad nauseum....."I did what I was supposed to do.....why am I catching heat?  or.....just as bad.....They keep piling on more and more so speed and initiative got me "punished"by means of them adding more (sort of like the Syphius Effect: you know the guy who spent eternity rolling the rock up the mountain, only for it to roll back down ad nauseum).  I learned to hide my initiative to those kinds of people and be myself around rational people who trusted my character to do what I was supposed to do and not give a whit how I made myself do it...nor add more work as a punishment!  LOL!  Even as a medical transcriptionist, the faster I typed, the more they piled it on....yet, it didn't seem to matter that they were paying "senior" transcriptionists higher pay for far slower work.  (I was a lowly summer hire student)  BUT when speed or initiative were my allies( rational people who had power over me or mentoring me), I was happier than a seagull during low tide!  LOL!

I 've a;wausloved worthwhile endeavors. I'll  gladly bust my hump to the bone if it seems well worth the effort and gaining the experience.

It seems that getting job satisfaction from doing a job well, or helping others, rather than purely financial reward, seems to come attached with a label saying "I'm a doormat, please feel free to walk over me - that's what I'm here for!".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 February 2009 at 9:56 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Learning,<br><br>The problem you describe is classic.
