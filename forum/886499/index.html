I am a longtime lurker of Mark's blog and discussion form.  I have been trying to use AF in all its forms since early this year, and I have to confess "try" is the correct term for my efforts in doing this.  I have tried quite a few personal organization schemes: generic Filofaxes, GTD, Seven Habits, the Balander (egads what a horrible name) by Dave Durand...all of which I have not been able to stick to well.  It was only with AF and some ideas from GTD (the file system and calendar dedicated for deadlines in particular) that I had a /semblance/ of organization in my life.  Well, it may just be because of my strong INTP personality, but I digress...<br><br>And yet even with AF I still had problems sticking with the scheme.  I would have fits of wanting to do the lists, followed by days or even weeks in between not touching or even forgetting about my list in my PDA.<br><br>That is, until I stumbled across Mark Forster's blog entry about "Keeping one's markers aligned"<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/1/keeping-ones-markers-aligned.html">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/1/keeping-ones-markers-aligned.html</a><br><br>I tried using the "two landmark purposes" idea of Mark Forster on one of my tasks in my AF list...and I was surprised I was able to finish cleaning my room, which I normally couldn't do in one go! Maybe I stumbled into something big, I thought.<br><br>But anyways I tried using this on my list for a whole week before posting here, it just might be a fluke, I thought.  And it was good....until AF4 came around, and HECK! AF4+Markers was even better! Almost 10 days of being able to stick to a time management scheme with minimal problems is actually phenomenal for one of my personality, so I am now confident to post what I do here.<br><br>It is really simple.  I use an electronic list software called Projekt in my Symbian smartphone. I do AF4 as Mark Forster instructs when using an electronic list, but with a few additional steps:  <br><br>1) I highlight the task I am about to do next by adding an item under the task.  In that item I state the reason for doing the said task using another color.  For example<br><br>_-- (in black font) comment on using AF4 + markers<br>___|----- (in red font) ---&gt; to help people become more disciplined<br><br>2) I close an Active List (to become the Backlog) not with a line, but with a statement of purpose for sticking with AF4 (distinguishing it from other tasks by adding dashes and different font color): <br><br>----- Diligence, Discipline w/o Anxiety -----<br><br>3) I try to write purposes on each undone task of the Backlog before deleting them.  If the purpose has merit, it goes to my "Maybe/Someday" list (I know, a relic of my GTD days); if the purpose is not good enough or cannot think of a purpose at all, the task is deleted.<br><br>I have no experience with using paper lists for AF, but I would guess it would be the same if you want to try this:<br><br>1) Highlight the active task by writing (beside the task item) an arrow followed by the purpose using a different-colored pen.<br><br>2) Close the list with your purpose of following AF, not just a line.  For example:<br>----- Diligence, Discipline w/o Anxiety -----<br><br>Why it works? For me I think it's because I forget my anxieties on how hard the task is by focusing on WHY I am doing it.  And without those anxieties my creative energies come out unhindered.<br><br>At least I think that's what's happening ^__^</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 September 2009 at 9:36 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi nuntym, <br><br>Interesting ideas...<br><br>I like the idea of doing this as I feel like I need a longer term 'mission' or direction so to speak in my main roles in life - even if it's just for this year. I think basic markers like 'develop fitness' 'improve finances' etc would help me relate these for this purpose. But I wonder if this 'top down' type of planning works against AF4 ?  <br><br>Sometimes a task looks mundane and I may question why it's written at all. But often it does align with a higher goal after all.  <br><br>Including markers might also be useful for recording how many tasks one has done to get to a higher goal, which might help with motivation and feedback.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 September 2009 at 11:38 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi nutym,<br><br>Very interesting ideas.

I've just made my own mission statement, let's see if I can integrate it to my AF.<br><br>---<br><br>Hi Joseph,<br><br>&lt;&lt;I think that in addition too reviewing tasks on the basis of their purpose being good enough or not you might also profit from reviewing them on the basis of whether or not the *task* is still aligned with the purpose.<br><br>It seems likely in some cases that your purpose is sound and valid, but the task to achieve it isn't the best one, or no longer relevant, and a better task could be found to achieve the same purpose.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Ah, thank you.

This is very interesting nuntym... I too have suffered in the (recent) past from list anxiety.

Sometimes its just '=&gt; FUN!' other times it more complex like '=&gt; reduce risk of missing deadline' and stuff like that. I have been working on keeping my items small (small word count) so I have room on the line for this now.<br><br>I found it so motivating, I went back over my pages and added the markers to all my old open items.<br><br>This has added a tiny kick to my motivation - and AF is all about tiny motivations adding up to major benefits. I am impressed. It also helps me identify the items where the benefit is too small or unlikely - and I will dismiss those with a lighter heart when the time comes.<br><br>So Thank You nuntym  - an EXCELLENT idea<br><br>Respect<br>Paul<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 September 2009 at 18:53 | Zytex aka Paul</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Paul!
