This morning I tried calling her on her cellphone (the only number I have) and it just rang out. I've now sent her a text message, wishing her Happy Christmas from all of us and asking how she is. I'll let you know if and when I get a reply. The only other way of contacting her I know of is on her Facebook page, which she hasn't posted anything on since August.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 December 2009 at 10:46 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm going to be taking a few days off over Christmas, so don't expect to see any contributions from me until Sunday evening (UK time) at the earliest.

I will try that since there's been no reply to any of my other messages.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 December 2009 at 13:43 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just received this email from Christine:<br><br>Hi Mark <br><br>Thank you so much for your concern – have just seen your message posted to Facebook on my email. <br><br>I am fine (well sort of!) now but it has been an “interesting” couple of months.  You may recall that I was having some health issues; well they got significantly worse and unfortunately the hospital took an inordinate amount of time to reach a correct (or hopefully now correct) diagnosis.  Whereas they initially said that I had the start of osteoarthritis they have now concluded that it is my body’s own immune system which is attacking my joints so have put me on some pretty heavy duty medication to suppress my immune system.  Great!! It has not yet kicked in to any great degree that I can tell but the pain is being managed to a pretty fair degree now with a cortisone injection &amp; anti-inflammatory meds although I am constantly tired.  On the up side – pain is a great appetite suppressant – I’ve lost about two stone! <br><br>By September I was struggling to write or even type much so switched my PC off to give it a rest (I usually keep it on most of the time).  That was a big mistake!  After that it never worked again!  My motherboard was fried and too expensive to repair.  I have extracted the hard drive so have all my data and am just now getting back up and running again.  The worst is resetting email accounts – I have just about completed that for all but two accounts but have had to “declare a backlog”...... about 3 – 4 months worth!!  Interestingly enough being offline was quite freeing – for the first couple of weeks I had major PC withdrawal symptoms but it made me realise how much time I normally spend online.  I haven’t accessed the forum for about three months – somehow I suspect I won’t catch up L  – but am looking forward to getting back.  I have had to completely rethink my “communication”.  Being unable to write much restricted my Christmas Card sending, being offline for email made me pretty inaccessible and as I could rarely get to the phone before it went to voicemail was constantly getting complaints of my mailbox being full.  I have had new phones for Christmas so that should not be a problem going forward – I should have enough phones now to be close enough to one at least!  I have also changed my mobile package and should now be able to text! <br><br>As you can imagine it has been quite a frustrating time.  I have so much respect for Vicky who seems to keep going in a far worse situation and I feel a real wimp sometimes.  Still I am determined to beat this and am taking each day at a time.  There are definitely upsides – I actually enjoyed Christmas shopping using Sainsbury’s and Tesco’s mobility scooters!  Not sure the other shoppers did though! <br><br>I really appreciate your concern Mark and please pass my best regards to everyone on the forum – I do hope to be back soon but my typing is still fairly restricted. <br><br>I do wish you all the very best for 2010 and thanks again Mark<br><br>Love Christine</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2010 at 19:20 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine, it might be a while before you get to read this, but just wanted you to know I have been thinking of you every time I visited the forum, you have been much missed by many it seems. Also how glad I am that things are now improving for you.<br><br>Regarding the auto-immune disease, I have lupus and have found Udo's Oil invaluable for reducing joint pain - it's available at all good health food shops in the fridge, and I take two tablespoons daily. I have found it much more effective than Cod Liver Oil alone so perhaps worth a try.<br><br>Best wishes for a continuing recovery (for you and your computer!)<br><br>Love B(ella)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2010 at 20:29 | little b</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Thanks for your persistence.<br><br>Christine,<br><br>I'm so happy you are at least managing.
