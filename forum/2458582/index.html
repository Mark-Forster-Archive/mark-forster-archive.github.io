That takes focus, which requires the ability to say NO, both to internal habits of thought as well as external tasks, distractions and other people. The vision probably needs to be as much about one's inner attitudes and habits of thought as much as external attainment. An undistracted mind has more power to express a vision in the material world. But a clear vision takes a lot of courage and self-honesty. Most of what we seek is misconceived - "miswanting" : "the act or condition of wanting something with the mistaken belief that it will bring one happiness".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 May 2015 at 14:19 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>michael:<br><br>Interesting that you should say that just now, since one of the changes I'm making in my "perfect version" of FV is to change the question from "What do I want to do before I do x ?" to "What do I want to do more than I want to do x ?"

Besides the whole system might still change pending on Mark's testing of the system.  And, to be honest, if that is the only change I'd be sorely disappointed because many people had tried to use that same question on FV simply because of a misunderstanding of the question "What do I want to do before I do x ?", and as far as I know all attempts at that failed.

But anyways, my guess.<br><br>1. Mark the first task. Think of this as task "x".<br>2. Scan down for and mark a task that answers the question "What do I want to do more than I want to do x?" This newly marked task becomes the new task x.<br>3. Keep on marking tasks until you cannot mark any more tasks that answer the algorithm question. You should have a chain of marked tasks now. Alternatively, you may not have been able to mark more tasks in the first place.<br>4. Do the last marked task and delete when done, if needed rewrite at the end. <br>5. Do not do the next task right away. Instead, use the algorithm again: think of the last marked task as "x", then go back to step 2. If all of the chain was acted on, go back to step 1.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 May 2015 at 2:16 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That actually sounds pretty good, nuntym.

This saves a lot of time if the list is long.<br><br>Ubi's idea of assessing from the last marked task would on the other hand miss a whole load of tasks that ought to be assessed.<br><br>The reason for this is that you have already established that there are no tasks you want to do more than the next task between it and the task you have just done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 May 2015 at 13:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>When I started doing nuntym's DECAF variation on Monday, I noticed that whether the question was "what would help me do this task" (which doesn't require looking at the whole list) or the the question mentioned above, "what do I WANT to do more than X?" (which does require looking through the whole list, which is daunting) was that what WANTED to do more than X and what would HELP get X done more than looking through the list was to just get started on the current chain because I had less resistance to start working than to look through the list. So I would just get started on what I had marked. <br><br>My problem is that on the first day it started turning into a mind dump and I wrote down 3 and a half pages for the first day (and I put home and work on the same list, since I noticed DECAF time based dismissal can worked in any order; you just skip out of context tasks until later). Granted, most of these tasks may end up getting dismissed (or not) but right now it's hard (with my attention span) to look through the whole list.<br><br>I'm not sure if the above is the obvious solution Mark hinted at to not looking through the whole list, but it is for me. Alternatives might be to stop after the current page, one page, the current section, or whenever you get tired of looking as I mentioned above (desire to do it is greater than the desire to look at list), or when you're fairly confident the item you have picked really stands out.<br><br>Another problem I have is since it's not electronic, it is hard to find something I know is the list, but I want to do before x (or would help me do x), or I don't remember if I wrote it down already). The obvious solution there is to put it at the end of the list and mark it (like in DECAF where you can add items to the end of the list that will help with x). Then you're done marking! When you run across the duplicate later, you can update it then.<br><br>I guess what I'm saying is I'd rather not have to look at the whole list, but I don't think that is the whole answer, because I think I'm still neglecting some areas. But I do want what I do to build upon itself to make progress on goals in all the necessary or desired areas of work or life. I don't think the answer is strict scheduling because you need to do things that make the most sense for that day, and I think that can change every day.<br><br>Maybe the obvious answer is if the list is too long you have to make it smaller somehow. Maybe a more aggressive dismissal process, whatever that might be.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 May 2015 at 14:26 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Don, I haven't read DECAF, but I think you can't mix the systems like that.  In any event, a brain dump of all the things that can contribute to you reaching your goal is definitely not what you want on an FV list.  <br><br>I think what you really want is for any large task or project, to identify the next actionable step.  This may take some planning or brainstorming to really think things through, but eventually you can narrow it down to one of two things you could work on now.  Put only those one or two items on the end of your actionable list (e.g. FV), and leave the rest with your project notes to consult at a later time.<br><br>Now that you've trimmed the contents, FV is really much easier than you make it out to be.  There's no search, no comprehensive understanding of its contents.  You simply look at one task (which you want to do) and the next task and decide whether or not to do it before the previously selected task.  If not, compare the first and the third.  Ultimately, just scan straight down, looking for something that will be done before that first until you find one.<br><br>But definitely restart with a small list, and either try FVP or DECAF but not the combination.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 May 2015 at 15:55 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Alan.
