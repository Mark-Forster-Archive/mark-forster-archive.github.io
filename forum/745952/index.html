I really like the way AF seems to enable me to work on the right things but I also like the structure of the pomodoro technique.  Anyway just curious if anyone has tried any kind of pairing of these before I go about trying to find one on my own.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 April 2009 at 17:04 | ChrisK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I discovered the pomodoro technique through Mark Forsters tweet and found it really interesting. I had been doing something quite similar in that I would time my predetermine  tasks with 24 minute countdown timers. Then I'd apply the AF rule of working on something as long as I feel like it. The trick is, for those resistant tasks, I'd focus for a minimal of 24 minutes, which isn't too long but still significant. I picked 24 minutes because it fits nicely with the pareto principle (2x24=48 minutes with a 12 minute break every hour).  It works magically for me. I tried 15 and 30 minutes but they were either too long or too short. <br><br>The nice thing is in most case the momentum you've built up in the 24 minutes implores you to keep going, even on the tasks you're keen to avoid.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 April 2009 at 17:47 | Peter K</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Some of my tasks are pomodores of 25'.  I like the 25' as 30' is maybe too much for me.  I see pomodores as a way to balance my AF list when bigger tasks, like 8x25' the next two days, needs to be done .</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 April 2009 at 20:01 | Damien</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I do 24 minute blocks also, although not for Pareto, or Pomodor. I do it because I get some bizarre satisfaction knowing it is  that it is 1/60th of a day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 April 2009 at 1:31 | Stark</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have used timers for years. The more resistance I have the fewer the minutes I shoot for.<br><br>I also try not to get too specific about what I need to do, if I have a lot of resistance. If I want to get some cleaning done in the living room, I don't write down a next task, I just go at it however I want for 20 minutes. <br><br>If I have something I absolutely think I am going to loath doing, I go at it for five minutes.<br><br>I can always go longer, but I never set a pre-determined amount of time I *must* spend doing the activity.<br><br>A timer is always a good idea for me, how long I set it for is what matters.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 April 2009 at 1:37 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree that timers are an excellent tool for breaking down high resistance tasks but and if we are in the position of "having" to do items because of external deadlines etc then they are an invaluable aid.  However they go against the rule to action a task "for as long as you feel".  For me that rule is one of the most freeing aspects of AF in that it removes even those last few vestiges of resistance.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 April 2009 at 7:52 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with Christine - AF is best not used with any timing techniques because they tend to remove one of the most characteristic aspects of AF. However if you are faced with a really tough nut to crack and a looming deadline, then by all means use the best tool for the job.<br><br>Having said the above, I am interested in seeing how the Pomodoro technique works out, so I might give it a shot myself one of these days. I am particularly intrigued by the rule "if it begins, it must ring".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 April 2009 at 10:25 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I just scheduled my day using Peter's approach. But I will NOT be scheduling specific tasks; rather work on the AF list itself. I'm going to try this approach with my school schedule. I think long periods of schooling with no breaks sends me into doing a whole lot of nothing afterward. When it comes to AF, I feel very comfortable working for 48 minutes (I LIKE doing AF) and then taking a 12 minute break, whereas I will do most school subjects for 24 minutes as opposed to the 30 I was doing. <br><br>If stopping work on my AF list at 48 minutes leaves me wanting more, so much the better. I have seen how powerful this quitting on time principle is in maintaining motivation. Our small group leaders at church wanted to find a time to meet monthly that was convenient and motivating. We decided to meet for just 20 minutes between church services once a month. The result has been AMAZING. Attendance is excellent and we always leave the meeting reluctantly because what we're discussing is still interesting! Limiting the time you have to work your AF list can have a similar effect imo even if you work at it in multiple time blocks as I plan to do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 April 2009 at 0:35 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's something we used to do with Scouts, end their activities when they were having fun so they would look forward to it next time.

It makes it easy to see that if I have 2 hours I have 4 blocks, 4.5 hours is 8 blocks etc. Sometimes I do 30mins on 30mins off work when I have a long day (and an evening alone). It also means if I am feel hassled its easy to see that I have so many time blocks and so can see its worth doing things even for that short time.<br><br>I have a list of blocks I do each day - af/ticker, plan food/sort fridge, water garden etc. Most of the jobs I try and do a whole block if I can or at least one task. I find it very useful for the AF/ticker list and cleaning as I have a set amount of time, rather than it possibly dragging out. Plus I think it is useful to put limits on thing as that stops it feeling too big and the procrastination monkey appearing. I find if I don't use time blocks the whole day feels too overwhelming and I get little done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 17:32 | Amber</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>WOW!<br><br>The pomodoro technique is just simply BRILLIANT!!!<br><br>This is my first day using it and I got SO much more (important procrastinated stuff) done than the days before...<br><br>This seems to be the ultimate procrastination buster.

If you work without breaks and get too tired, you can still do tasks for 'as long as you like' but that won't be long! :-)<br><br>I split bigger tasks into a number of pomodoro, and glob smaller related tasks into a single pomodoro, so for me it doesn't conflict with AF rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 July 2009 at 18:03 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have to say the Pomodoro Technique looks very intriguing...

Small enough chunk that you don't feel overwhelmed or can't squeeze it in. Large enough that you get rolling and you get enough done during it that you don't feel guilty stopping. It's also small enough that it forces you to break things down into reasonable chunks. Three 15s in a row, then break for 15. Avoid doing the same thing twice in a row, otherwise you end back at all or nothing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 August 2010 at 14:12 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been experimenting with this too, especially when I have a large number of large tasks that all need to show some progress.  <br><br>I use a timer and allow myself to work only for 18 minutes, or 36 minutes if I feel I need a little more time.  For some reason I find 18 minutes and 36 minutes work pretty well for me.   When the timer beeps, I stop, mid-sentence if needed, save the file, minimize the window, set aside the paperwork, and move on to the next DWM task that stands out.  Set the timer, work on that task, stop mid-sentence at the beep, and move on.  This really worked great last week -- I cranked out a lot of work.<br><br>The only problem happens if you're in a thunderstorm and your microwave-wireless-broadband internet connection freaks out and makes all your web applications freeze up.
