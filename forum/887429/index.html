His book IMO is a must-read if you are going to use Outlook intensively.  A quick guide to the system is contained in his current newsletter <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.michaellinenberger.com/NewsletterSept1-09.html.">http://www.michaellinenberger.com/NewsletterSept1-09.html.</a><br><br>To answer your specific question I am experimenting (so far successfully) with a hybrid Outlook/AF4 system.  It basically involves putting all tasks into Outlook using the Linenberger approach, printing out the taskpad tasks each morning and then working the list as an AF4 list.  This includes adding new tasks by hand to the printed list.  At the end of the day I insert new unfinished tasks back into Outlook and then start again the next morning.  Where the printed list ends and the hand written list starts creates a natural barrier between new and old tasks.<br><br>I'm finding that this hybrid system gives me the benefit of both worlds - software automation as well as personal engagement with a hand-written list.  In a nutshell, I use Outlook to build the task list and AF4 to work the list.<br><br>Hope that makes sense.<br><br>Jack</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 September 2009 at 9:27 | Jack C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@ Greenchutney<br><br>I'm not using the built-in Blackberry tasks software but a third-party addon called ToDoMatrix but I think the principles should apply to other software.<br><br>But the basic trick is that I use two separate folders of tasks, one for the backlog and one for the active list. ToDoMatrix allows you to move tasks between folders very easily, and the same goes for moving an entire folder of tasks to another folder.<br><br>Also, tasks are sorted in DateCreated order for both lists and set to regenerate immediately after completion (by using a 1 min regeneration interval).<br><br>I hide all completed tasks in both lists to keep the lists uncluttered on a small screen.<br><br>As soon as I work on any task in the Backlog list, I mark it as complete so that the creation date/time on it is updated and then move it immediately to the Active list so that it should now appear at the bottom of that list.<br><br>In my active list, I have a regenerating task called "&gt;&gt;&gt; RETURN TO BACKLOG &lt;&lt;&lt;". As soon as I enter the active list, I mark it as complete so it moves to the bottom of the active list. Then I work my way down the active list until I hit that task and move back to the backlog list again.<br><br>At the bottom of the backlog list, I have a regenerating task called "&gt;&gt;&gt; REVIEW MARKER &lt;&lt;&lt;"<br><br>When I get around to marking tasks for review (this is theory, not had to do it yet), I will simply copy the entire folder of active tasks into the backlog folder. They should all appear under "REVIEW MARKER". That means that every task above that is now up for dismissal. Once I delete/re-enter those "on-notice" tasks, I can then mark the "REVIEW MARKER" as complete which should regenerate it back at the end of the backlog list tasks.<br><br>Hope that makes some sense. :)<br><br>There's no reason you couldn't implement this approach with other task management software. They key to the slickness of usage of this approach is having the ability to regenerate tasks immediately on completion.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 September 2009 at 9:42 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I forgot to mention that there is a feature in ToDoMatrix which allows you to have default settings for each new task you create - and I have this set to automatically create new tasks with a regenerating 1 minute interval.<br><br>This saves me from having to fiddle with any task settings on creating the task...I just enter a task on the list and I know it will recur immediately until I delete it off the list (which is how I mark tasks as finally complete).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 September 2009 at 9:50 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another thing I forgot to mention!<br><br>Tickler items are handled automatically. I have both lists filtered to not show any future tasks. So let's say I need to check if the house bins need emptying but I only need to start checking every 2 days.<br><br>I create that task "Empty house bins" and then change the regeneration interval to 2 days.<br><br>So once I mark the task complete, it will not regenerate immediately like the other tasks but just vanish.<br><br>After two days have elapsed, it will show up on my list again. If I had previously marked it complete while in the backlog list, it will show up there while if I had previously marked it complete in the active list, it will show up there instead.<br><br>I can live with the fact that it might show up in either list because it will still get noticed by me at the right time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 September 2009 at 10:08 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;&gt;The best pure Outlook task management system I have seen is Michael Linenberger's.

I was plannig on ditching electronic lists but the recurring items as an electronic tickler and the Calendar work so well I decided I was cutting my nose off to spite my face. <br><br>AF is brilliant at actually processing tasks but there are some advantages to electronic that I haven't been able to give up yet.

You can then add/modify another view that filters for 'Categories contains "Review"', which will then show all such tasks - and no others - for use when you want to actually do a review.<br><br>Note: if you use a mobile device (or often use OWA) in addition to the normal Outlook client you need to think about how this will work for them, as they don't have quite the same level of functionality.<br><br>Steve<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 September 2009 at 19:57 | SteveB</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>SteveB,<br><br>Get thee behind me!<br><br>Tempting, though it is, I've already got views for printing and also for reviewing daily achievements.

Delete dismissed tasks and assume they'll come back into mind (and be added as new items) if appropriate,<br>2. Retain dismissed tasks in the "normal" view, and perhaps use conditional formatting to de-emphasise them, or<br>3.

The one area I found tiresome was re-entering tasks which recur on a regular basis which Outlook handles very well. I also find that it's much easier to track if these items have been done as they are dated automatically, whereas with written items you have to manually mark each task. <br><br>At the moment I am keeping two lists, one in Outlook for recurring items and one in my notebook to keep on top of more long-standing tasks. I am not altogether happy with this and I might just try and tweak Linenberger's Outlook set up to reflect AF4 as best I can. Having two seperate lists to maintain is too much overhead and I'd rather just have one list to look at to keep things as simple as possible. Besides, as my Outlook already synchs with my phone, portability isn't a problem, it's more a case of just choosing a method and then having the discipline to stick with it. Mobile phones aren't the best screens to work a list from when you are out and abouut but then I've found there are  problems whatever implement you choose so best just to pick one and get on with it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2009 at 14:23 | Ashak</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>SteveB,<br><br>I'm trying the modified date approach.

In the default mode, all previous tasks are highlighted in red font the next day so they could be treated as the closed list. In Linenberger's system the older tasks filter to the bottom but are no longer underlined, so they also could be treated as the closed list. I'm sure there are probably other ways of making this system reflect AF4 on paper, but the basic process is the same.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 October 2009 at 22:24 | Ashak</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If anyone particularly wants a "duplicate task" macro of the type Alex W refers to, let me know - I have one as part of a wider set of macros I use.<br><br>It will however take a little time to remove/adjust a few bits that won't work / make sense without other aspects of my overall solution (i.e. to make it stand-alone), and I'm not sure how to make it available if it's too long to post here, but if there's a demand for it...<br><br>It works in OL2007, but I believe it should work in OL2003 as well - although in that case I think you only retain any formatting applied to the Task's Notes (Body section) if the option to use Word as the email editor is set.<br><br>N.b. At some point, assuming it calms down into a steady state, I hope to share the wider set of macros along with usage/setup guidance in case anyone's interested... covering some other things that may be of interest to Outlook users (whether for AF4 or just for email/etc), such as:<br>- automatically assigning whatever Categories are assigned to Contacts that're the sender/recipients of an email to that email item<br>- marking a task as 'current' and then automatically recording the time taken when it is completed, with an option to record that time-block as a calendar item as well<br>- a workaround for the fact that Outlook doesn't support tasks with a start date but no due date (which makes regenerating undated tasks impossible by default), and which also supports automatically-recreating all future-start-dated, recurring and regenerating tasks so that they have the "correct" creation date (useful for AF!)<br><br>...but that may take a while (if I even get around to it ;-)<br><br>Anyway, if there's a call for a cleaned-up copy of the duplicate-task code I'll try to find an easy way to share it.<br>-Steve</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 October 2009 at 19:04 | SteveB</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>SteveB,<br><br>I would certainly value a duplicate task macro.

For Outlook 2007 I've done the following:<br><br>1a. Right-click on menu bar and select "Customize...".<br>1b. Select the Macros category on the left and then drag the "Project....CreateNewTaskFromItem" entry onto the menu bar (e.g. to the right of 'Help'.<br>1c. Right-click that new 'menu' item and change the Name to: "&amp;1. Create New Task From Item" (or whatever you like, though the "&amp;1" is recommended for reasons below).<br>1d. Close the 'Customize' dialog<br><br>Now if you press "Alt+1" from the main Outlook window, a new Task will be created based on whatever object(s) are currently selected.<br><br>In order to have the same "Alt+1" shortcut do the same thing when you have an individual Task/Email/whatever open in its own window, do the following:<br><br>2a.

Select Macros under "Choose commands from:", and dd the CreateNewTaskFromItem to the toolbar items on the right, and move it to the top.<br>2c. Select the macro item and click "Modify..." below the list, and set its Display Name to whatever you want (e.g. "Create New Task From Item").<br><br>Quick Access Toolbar shortcuts can be initiated with Alt+n where n is the number of their position in the list, so as the top item Alt+1 will now run the macro. (This is why I have the macro on the main window's actual menu bar (with "&amp;1" in the name to set the access key as "1") as opposed to on the toolbar or a menu sub-item - it can have the same keyboard shortcut!)<br><br>To enable this for items other than Tasks, repeat 2a-2c but opening an existing Email/Appointment/etc. instead - the Quick Access Toolbar list is separate between each Outlook Form.<br><br>Hope it works well for you...<br>Steve</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 October 2009 at 19:23 | SteveB</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
