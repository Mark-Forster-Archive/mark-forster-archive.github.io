You need a page-a-day diary &gt;&gt;<br><br>Fine. <br><br>&lt;&lt; 2. All new tasks are entered on the page which is one calendar month...&gt;&gt;<br><br>Huh? I often have "new tasks" that need to be done today, latest tomorrow. As well, responding to a new client must happen today, latest tomorrow. Where would I place these items? <br><br>&lt;&lt; 3. All re-entered tasks are entered on the page which is one week from today. &gt;&gt;<br><br>So even though I finish a task, I must renter the task a week from today. What about a task that I work on in the AM, and want to continue working on in the PM? <br><br>&lt;&lt;5. All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Are the "active pages" today's date... I'm confused. <br><br>&lt;&lt; 6. All tasks which are on pages earlier than today’s date have expired. They are dead, done for, dismissed, deceased.&gt;&gt;<br><br>I like this.<br><br>Any help would be appreciated.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 13:41 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Avrum,<br><br>let me give your questions a shot:<br><br>I interpret the new System as beeing an Autofocus list with built in dismissal dates. Every task remains active for at least one month. Once you start working on something, you only get a week to continue. All pages later than today are active, all pages earlier are dismissed. The way I understand it is that the calendar is not serving a daily planning purpose but is only serving as an automatic dismissal or deletion mechanism.<br><br>Put differently: if you have taken on an obligation and haven't started working on it within a month, then there is possibly something wrong with it. This means that you need to analyze what is wrong.<br><br>The proposed system is clearly a task management system and not a time management system, despite being run inside a calendar.<br><br>Oh, and to your #3, once a task is finished, you take it from the list.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br><br>Klaus</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 14:11 | Klaus</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark<br>Thanks for the outline-quite intriguing.<br>Can I ask what to do with new projects that need working or<br>or completion before a month from current date?<br>viz urgent/pressing projects or tasks.<br>Thanks again<br>Jay</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 14:28 | Jay</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh,I think I get it!<br>Are the entries actually deadlines (rather than actual work done) that you see when you<br>look through the diary?<br>I am going to try it for sure,but am worried if I will <br>miss a deadline if there are too many items<br>that need completion before the month-do you take action on these<br>anyway(common sense rule) and then reenter them as per rules?<br>Thanks again Mark<br>Jay</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 14:36 | Jay</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I understand that you ENTER new tasks on a page that is 1 month away, but WORKING from the list means going through ALL pages from today to this page 1 month away (31 pages at the most) and working on whatever task stands out.<br><br>You work as long as you feel like, but this feeling might change once you have internalized that RE-ENTERING means that now you only have 1 WEEK to pick it up again.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>I guess I'm more the AF type. At least this new rule set does not ignite the "hey wow cool" feeling in me that reading the original AF rule set did. I'm curious how this will work for others, but in the moment I stay with my slightly adapted AF3 system...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 14:38 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Klaus - thank you for putting it so clearly. <br><br>Jay - I think the dates are to be considered as "dismissal deadlines", not actual *project* deadlines. <br><br>And as someone pointed out; Franklin Coveys 2-page diary now makes sense :-)<br><br>/Jonaz</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 14:48 | Jonaz in Stockholm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It sounds like a great idea for dismissal ! <br><br>The only thing I don't understand is why one doesn't just write things down on the current day, re-write on the next day you work on it so you only keep bringing it forward as you work on it, go back to previous days to choose tasks as well as desired/inspired, then delete anything that's on any page more than a month old.<br><br>It also seems you'd have to really watch the phrasing of tasks.  Big, multi-month projects would have to be chunked down, which is probably a good thing anyway.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 15:14 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;The only thing I don't understand is&gt;&gt;<br><br>Jacqueline - your idea is quite sound. <br><br>However as someone mentioned on the blog portion of this site... the new system is starting to morph into your average to-do list with built-in dismissal.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 15:19 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like this "dismissal deadline" very much. I'm working with an index-card based system which consists of a tickler, an AF part, and - since the last few months - a kind of "backward tickler". Unactioned items, mostly ideas, are allowed to stay for four weeks in the "backward tickler" before they drop off into an archive. The idea is to allow a kind of incubation time, since ideas need time to grow and form into themes or actions. <br><br>What I like about the new System is that it has this 4-week-incubation-time built in, and that unactioned items are removed from the list automatically. So I just rearranged my cards to represent AF5, or whatever it will be called. In addition, I will keep my classic tickler which feeds cards into the list on a daily basis. Since these are mostly routine jobs, I plan to add them to the current day, instead of one month ahead.<br><br>For the moment, I'm quite happy. It feels as if Mark had incorporated my vague attempt into a well-thought system...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 15:20 | Ulrich J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm very bad with sticking to an organized list.  A1 to A4 never worked for me.  A list has only been a list for me.  Getting messy in 15 min and all the rules forgotten.<br><br>Now, the new systems seems to speak to me. I actually like it very much, and not because it's new and shiny.  I'm ready to try it.  Thank you Mark for posting it today, because yesterday I outlined my own system, which is different but merges very well with your idea.  I can start practicing both and will see how it goes.  <br><br>I only need to keep my lists neat.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 16:28 | Ilse</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Has Mark abandoned the idea of a closed list?

But thinking it over I see some interesting things:<br><br>* one long list that you can process in whatever way seems suitable<br>* automatic dismissal, as in AF2 ("the marching line of doom" as someone called it). In AF2 the automatic dismissal process was too slow for me, I can see how it would work better in this new system<br>* still a closed list, although it doesn't look like it: today's page can't be added to! So if nothing else that's what you should work on to call it a day without dismissing them.<br>* being able to see how much work comes in each day, and how much I'm clearing every day<br><br>So I think I'll be trying this for a few months...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 16:44 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ulrich -- thanks for those thoughts.  I also have an index card system for routine tasks.  I was using AF and the Routine Cards separately, but I'll try merging them now.<br><br>I can almost see the solution for adding a DIT/closed list/current initiative feature.  Much like the Daily Routines you add to Today (or keep in the front), I could have a card for Current Initiative (which starts on top Every Day).  Then a 2nd card in the stack for today's closed list, culled from a review of all cards at the end of the previous day.  Only a few choice (or urgent) items would make it to this list.  I'd let the system work its magic with the rest.  That way I'd still get the Warm Feeling of Finished List at the end of the day.<br><br>Sure, I'll be duplicating some items, but my memory is good enough for that.  When I next see the *done* item elsewhere in the stack, I'll just remove it or tick it off.<br><br>If I were using a page-a-day diary or my beloved Field Notes, I'd use 2 sticky notes, as I did with previous AF systems.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 16:58 | slothbear</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Name ideas for new system::<br><br>Future Focus<br><br>Forward Focus<br><br>Catch and Release<br> (because, like a fisherman, you're "catching" up a bunch of tasks and then "releasing" them into the future to be worked with--ok, that's a little lame, but it's better than "Do It, Um, Before It Expires...)<br><br>Any other ideas?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 17:09 | Jim (Atlanta)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>O.K.  So ....<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  But in the case of the new DIT2/AF5 system, I think it might be more helpful to have other people working on it with me at the same time so that we can share our experiences of it together.<br><br>So what I am going to do now is to share the basic outline of what I’m doing now, so others can run with it and see what they can make of it. I’m not going to go into much detail because I think that would destroy the purpose of the exercise - the detail should appear from our experience of working the system.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I like your thinking Mark.  The only thing I think has already become evident is that some terms are a bit unclear.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  This is what it consists of:<br><br>1. You need a page-a-day diary with plenty of lines. Also some form of bookmarking for today’s date and the two entry pages (see below) - though turned down page corners are probably quite sufficient.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I now get why you need so many lines.  Everything you work on and don't complete is getting dumped on to a page where you already added all new tasks that came up on that day.  The light dawns ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  2. All new tasks are entered on the page which is one calendar month from today’s date. Example: Today’s date is February 1st. New tasks are entered on the page for March 1st. Tomorrow I will enter new tasks on March 2nd and so on. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Here is the first point where I see that we need some clarification.  It SEEMS as if you can't start working on something new until a month ahead.  What I think you are intending is that this system looks FORWARD for work, rather than BACKWARD, as the AF systems did.  IOW, you are not continually scanning the past, but scanning the future, as it were.  I'm not sure how much of a change this really is, but I'll bet the psychological effects will turn out to be significant.<br><br>As noted by others, this comes down an implied rule: "You start work on a task within one month."  The effect is that you can't ignore a task for a month and still think you have any intention of doing it at all.  Nice.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  3. All re-entered tasks are entered on the page which is one week from today. So any task I re-enter today (Monday February 1st) goes on the page for for next Monday (February 8th). Tomorrow (Tuesday) they will go on the page for next Tuesday 9th and so on.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>As noted, this comes down an implied rule: "You must continue work on a task within one week."  The intention is that if you don't do anything on a task within a week, you need to consider what is going wrong, slipping, etc.  Nice.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  4. Nothing is ever entered on any page, other than the pages currently one month and one week from today’s date.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>O.K.  There is the closed list people have been hankering for ;-)  The only difference seems to be (and again, I have not read your DIT books, but they are ordered and in the mail -- see, I'm not TERMINALLY stubborn, though my wife would challenge that ;-) that one can't PLAN a days' work ... which is what I gathered the essence of DIT was.<br><br>You fundamental "grass catcher" is going to be one month hence, and no matter how long or short the day, or if it falls on a weekend or not, it is going to have all that work piled on.  In addition, incomplete tasks will also be dumped there a week before you reach it, thus all those lines.  When you get there, you are very probably going to have a TON of work to do.  So I can see some possible problems there.<br><br>SUGGESTION: Should we distinguish between weekends and weekdays in this system.  IOW, will it be problematic to add work tasks to a weekend simply because the date falls that way?  The converse is also true.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  5. All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I think we need to define ACTIVE PAGES.  I'm assuming that this means TODAY plus all pages FORWARD?  This really does have the feel of an upside down AF list ;-)<br><br>If this is the definition of "active pages" it changes the idea of "closed list" a bit.  IOW, you are working on today's "closed list" plus the "closed lists" for the next six days, plus the "open list" for the seventh day, plus the "closed lists" for the next 21 days (or whatever), plus the "open list" for one month ahead.  It certainly sounds more confusing than it actually is.  Now I'm starting to think that the concept of "closed list" really has lost its effect.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  6. All tasks which are on pages earlier than today’s date have expired. They are dead, done for, dismissed, deceased.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Mark, could you come up with a different word for "dismissed"?  ROTFLMAO ;-)  Never let it be said that you don't learn from feedback ;-)<br><br>SUGGESTION:  I'm assuming that we are going to put into effect some kind of AF like dismissal rule.  IOW, was your thinking that things just kind of "expire" or that we go through some kind of review where we yellow line so the ones that expired stand out for future consideration, and deliberately reconsider other tasks to be moved forward one week?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  The thinking behind this is that you can put anything you like into the system. If you do nothing about it, it will remain there for a month and then expire. If at any time you commit yourself to a task by taking some action on it, you are put under increased pressure to get it finished by being given only seven calendar days to do some more work on it. Of course many tasks are done in one go, so can be deleted without being re-entered.<br><br>That’s all you need to get started.   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Great.  I like it.  It makes a lot of sense and your thinking about this way of approaching tasks is inspired.  It is also a good reason to continue to call it "autofocus" ... it still has the effect of "automatically focusing" one.<br><br>SUGGESTION: We probably need to consider how to transition to this system.  I suppose I could date the next 30+ pages (skipping the dates for the next six days) then treat my entire back pages as if they were on today's page, pretend that the next week is all that backlog, and then a week later I should be fully operational?  Does that make sense to anyone?<br><br>This really does sound like fun ;-)  Thanks Mark.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 17:26 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'd been thinking I wasn't going to try the new system because my schedule is so unpredictable that the un-dated-ness of AF works very well for me.

Everything not tackled today (and subsequently either finished or carried forward by 7 days) will be dismissed automatically. And you can not add any new items on today’s page.<br><br>“The only thing I don't understand is why one doesn't just write things down on the current day”<br><br>Jacqueline, I think that’s part of the automatic dismissal. If something new comes up, you have one month to tackle it. Once you have started working on it, but not finishing it in one go, you have 7 days time to pick it up again.<br><br>But I must admit, I haven’t started the system yet. Just wonder about two little modifications (ahh, the tweaks again):<br>•	Daily recurring tasks: have it on today’s page, finish it and cross it off, put the next instance on tomorrow’s page (not the page which is one week from today)<br>•	Tasks with a deadline: I would put them on the page for the respective deadline date<br><br>Mark, any comments on my ideas?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 18:06 | Christian G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christian,<br><br>I would expect that Mark might say use a calendar for the date senstive tasks, but since you are already using a calendar, I'd write them in some distinctive way on the appropriate day.  Of course, you'd then have to scan ahead to avoid missing.<br><br>Recurent tasks: if you want to put them in this system, I'd say that they'd be the exception to the rule of not putting anything on any other page ... OR ... since this is one long list that you are cycling through, you'll get to that page a week hence and see them there.  Unless you feel you really need to see them listed on the exact day they need to be done.  If that is the case, I'd put them on the correct page, or simply take them OUT of this system.  I have reminder lists and cards that are no part of this system.  For example, I have a list of things my wife likes me to pack in her lunch in the morning.  I have grocery shopping lists.  None of that goes into the AF list.  Nor does "brush teeth", "take show".

The two dates are just there to put pressure on you to get working on stuff.  So the input page (grass catcher in my terms) is one month forward not because things need to be done then, but as an AUtOMATIC dismissal mechanism.  If you don't work on those tasks within a month they need to go.  Likewise for the week forward, if you don't CONTINUE working on an unfinished task, you need to be goosed!<br><br>Now if a task has a DUE DATE, what have we done with ANY AF system?  We have put it OUTSIDE of the system and onto a calendar.  Do the same here.

One of the beautiful ideas behind DIT in my view was the factual journaling of your day. Even though for planning purposes I always prefer a weekly calendar, after I entered the appointments in the DIT diary this would enable me to see at a glance how much I could attempt to do on any given day.<br><br>An e-Mail with a two hour job would come in today. I would immediately see that I am travelling tomorrow, therefore unable to work on this until the following day and this would be where I enter it. Of course certain things could be scheduled even further in advance. This elegance I very much admired in DIT. Also certain periods like weekends could be reserved for the kids or, if necessary, switched over to work periods.<br><br>However you look at it, this new system seems to be more of a motivational, psychiological ploy than the planning system that was DIT. I was really hoping for an addition in order to better handle interruptions for example. Also the recurring task bit is in my view not handled successfully.

It may be due to the fact that I sometimes do not look at my list for days for various reasons. The other stuff that I mentioned is actually more serious in my view. The sheer elegance of sending reminders to yourself like in a tickler (which I never liked as a separate entity) is missing in comparison with DIT.<br><br>Leon:<br><br>I used an A5 diary (the red one from Moleskine) in exactly this way last year and I am setting up my Filofax for something similar. There is a relatively small monthly planner that I use for overview and pocketability. My calendar is a day per page where more detail is entered like start / stop times of appointments. The to do items then go around these reserved time blocks. This will also allow me to fit in the rest of my family and to reserve time for various kid events, playing and of course time with my wife.<br><br>The result is a day to day overview on how I plan to use my time and how I used it in the past. What came in surprisingly and what was I able to accomplish in an orderly fashion. What I still don't like in this system is rescheduling. I do use a pencil for everything but it is still messy.<br><br>And you also need to work in a very disciplined manner, otherwise you will get behind and will keep on chasing backlogs. That was one of the nice things of the AF system. If something didn't get done now it would still be on the list for some more time to come. There is no false sense of urgency. Things would only get tackled if they stand out for whatever reason, in DIT things get tackled because they got in yesterday!<br><br>This is why I want the best of both!

New tasks could be processed by giving them 4 lives (4 weeks) where a 're-entered task' has only 1 life. A 'new task' could then be pushed 3 times forward by the dismissal line.  This would give the greater simplicity of an automatic dismissal, hampered by a complex - messy - unusual  4 lives dismissal.<br>On the other hand  using a calendar where open - actionable items stand on today and the next 30 days is also unusual.

This could be done in an electronic system without explicitly using calendar pages. Whether this *feels* good to use is another matter.<br><br>I worked with David Allen at Actioneer many years ago, and his main innovation was that todos should *never* go on a calendar. In the case of AF5, the calendar is being used for an end date and not a start date, so this is not exactly a violation of David's principles. However, once you base your system on a calendar, the temptation to start using the calendar in a more traditional time-management manner is going to be very tempting.

This is where my Levenger Circa comes in handy.  I rearranged pages and wrote 2/9-2/28 on the top corners of pages, inserted a divider, then wrote 3/1-3/28 on the top corner of pages after divider.  I put my list from yesterday on 3/1, crossed out one and re-entered it on 2/9 (since it's a book I'm reading for a class) and crossed out another completely.

I use the time-slot side for appointments on their actual day and the list side for AF. When I am ready to work in the morning, I check the appointment side, then move on to "tackle the list" mode.

And yes, it shows up on Feb 8, because I put it on my list yesterday  Feb 1 (my day one) to begin with, read to him last night, checked it off and put it on Feb 8, one week out.

I will slowly need to develop a surer way to distinguish between "re-entering" an existing task and "entering" a new task. If I have an ongoing project to purge my (real physical) file cabinet, and my next task is to purge the "Computer" folder, and I finish that task, do I re-enter the next task, which is to purge the "Consultants" folder, or do I enter a new task? It is all part of an ongoing project, so it would make sense to call it a re-entry and give it a 7-day deadline. But, it could be viewed as a new task in an old project, which would permit a one-month deadline.<br><br>2. I can see that either I will stick with the system and it will impose a rigorous discipline on me, or I will break down and abandon the system. In years past, I gave deadlines to all my tasks. And then I blithely ignored them. This new system is quite different from AF4 (and other AFs). In the AFs, I developed a habit of reading many books simultaneously. I might read as little as a page or two in a book, and then return to it 3-4 weeks later and read another page. With this new system, that will no longer be possible. And that is probably better. It really will focus me on a narrower range of active items. Of course, how I resolve the issue in number 1, above, will greatly affect how the system works. If working on an ongoing project qualifies for "re-entry" then I will be forced to limit (i.e. focus) how many projects I take on at any time. I see that I might be working more on fewer projects than I was in AF4. Again, this strikes me as a good thing, but I can't be sure until I try it.<br><br>3. This seems to be the first system since DIT1 that is effective for me for recurrent tasks. I never could get my recurrent tasks to integrate in the AFs. I always had to go outside the system. But I have incorporated them seamlessly in this new system.<br><br>In conclusion, I have mixed emotions. There is some anxiety. I can hear the clock ticking as never before, since I have a page that expires on 9 February and it is filled with items. On the other hand, I sincerely believe that I could seriously become more disciplined if I am able to stick with the rigid deadlines this new system will impose on me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 16:12 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Moises,<br><br>Re point 1 - it really depends what you think will motivate you better and that may vary from one project to another.  <br><br>You can manage that project at the project level by continually re-entering the project name on the list, in which case you would re-enter 7 days away.

One month is the same number of the month as today.<br><br>What is difficult about that? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Well, I guess if I knew what was the difficulty it might not be difficult.  I don't know, the flipping around remembering what date I entered what task on is just confusing.  I don't think that in the long run it will be a problem.  Once I get the hang of it it will be easy enough.<br><br>If you remember, the first thing I wanted to change was to make the far out date one month rather than 30 days so I would be less confused about what date was 30 days from today.  I agree, a pack of cards is more likely to fall on hard times than a book, but Alan's suggestion really does make it simpler ... you don't even need the pages numbered, if you don't want to have numbered pages.  You just find the 30th page ahead and mark it with a clip and enter tasks there.  You mark the one 7 ahead with a clip then the system runs without reference to dates or page numbers or anything.  Just move each clip ahead one each day and throw away the first page.<br><br>Also, this answers the problem people see of putting the system aside for a few days then trying to restart it.  With dates it seems as if it would be a mess to restart.  Without dates, you just pick it up and restart it as if it were the next day.<br><br>But that was a good one about how one could find a pre dated book ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 1:56 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If you want to get started but you don't have a diary handy, try here:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.diyplanner.com/">http://www.diyplanner.com/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 3:47 | Daniel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My two issues are about what happens if you stop and need to restart and that for me it just seems odd to add something in the future that will already have expired by then.<br><br>I will have to reread what Mark wrote about renumbering in order to restart.

How?"<br><br>Yes. By thinking of page#8 and page#31 (or index card#s). When you realize you only need to handle 31 pages or cards, the question leads to "Why 31? Why not 25?" etc.<br><br>Mark also asked: "[ubi wrote:] &lt;&lt; I wonder if Mark thinks there is something important about having all the "dead" pages in the diary and carrying it around all year... &gt;&gt; Well, exactly the same applies to an appointment diary or to a book you are reading. Do you tear the pages out of them once you've used/read them? Maybe you do."<br><br>No, but the already-read pages of a book aren't "dead" to me in the same way that crossed-off lists are, and I don't need to carry the current book I'm reading with me everywhere, for a whole year.  An appointment diary has potential value for all the days of the year, both in planning and reviewing dates of events.  In AF, we didn't need a 365-page notebook, and a pocketable one worked fine for AF4.  So my question was really about whether you thought there was value in reviewing the old pages in this new system. If I understand your new system correctly, the old pages are truly dead, and the pages after today+31 cannot be used. So unless we combine functions into some type of reminder system + your new system, we're only using 8.5% of the pages.<br><br>Finally, Mark joked: "Perhaps you'll understand it better after the first few times you have dropped your index cards and have to rearrange them all."<br><br>Yes, perhaps. But I think I'll try it that way, as being able to keep something in my pocket, with enough room to write the lists, is a big advantage over carrying a non-pocketable journal or diary.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 13:50 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>"I'm not really quite sure why everyone is having such a problem with the dates. To me it seems quite simple. One week is the same day of the week as today. One month is the same number of the month as today. <br><br>What is difficult about that?"<br><br>I think I get why this is a problem at first for many and why Alan's idea of numbered rather than dated pages seems good at first blush (even though they're really the same basic method).<br><br>When you go into a fuller explanation of this new system (which I've been calling Forward Focus) you just need to make it clear that this "list calendar" has nothing to do with one's appointment calendar.  It's not a problem for me because I use google's calendar for appointments and a notebook for the new system.  It is undeniably strange to write something on my list that I know is "due" by the end of the week or so on a list that, at the top of the page, says "March 3rd" because by March 3rd I'd be in serious trouble for not doing it.  It also feels strange to be writing re-curring tasks like "check email" on a list that has a date a week hence when you know you'll most likely be doing it in a couple of hours at the most.<br><br>So numbering rather than dating sounds like a fix to this kind of confusion.  But I think you are right that since it's so easy to buy a calendar and start using it that it seems silly to make up a new way of doing it.  We just need to try your method for at least a month and a new habit will form.<br><br>I also wasn't one of those people that had my list spread over 30+ pages before, so knowing I will soon be doing just that is a bit unnerving.<br><br>However, while I thought AF4 was the best, I did tend to leave things above the line of demarcation too long and the automatic dismissal of this new system is something I think will be of great benefit once people get used to it.  As you always say: trust the system!<br><br>Like Alan, I am using my same blank notebook, but unlike Alan I simply jotted "2/9" and so on through "2/28" in the top corner of each page before a divider (which could be anything--a sticky note even) and "3/1" and so on after the divider so it doesn't feel like a calendar to me, just a different way of organizing the notebook I was already using.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Jim</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 13:55 | Jim (Atlanta)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Dated or not, each active page becomes more urgent as they approach the front of your list.  <br><br>One tweak I would make to the dated approach arises because I like today's date to be a record of what I worked on today.  By this system, Today+7 is the record of today's work (everything you work on gets re-entered 7 days from now), except tasks you complete don't get entered on that date.  <br><br>To solve that, I might skew the dates backward so that I'm dismissing pages 7 days old, and re-entering worked-on tasks on today.  I fear this might ruin the psychology of things because Today's date might feel like things I ought to do today when in fact by this adjustment last Wednesday contains the things I _must_ work on.  Or maybe with the right mindset, all past-dated tasks will feel neglected and I won't put them off 7 days at a time because every one of those will make me feel guilty for not getting them done on time :-)  I understand though "done on time" is not an element of this system, and the dates are more psychological than obligations.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 14:08 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>Another issue I see with that approach is that today+7 doesn't only hold tasks you re-added today, but also tasks you added a month-7 ago.

I gave it a shot, and even though it looks like I'm working on a weekly to-do list, I have to say not bad.  <br>Now I'm eager to try playing with different intervals.  What if I didn't put the large list a month out, but 3 weeks out or 5 weeks out?  Or my 1-week list became a 4 day list.  I wonder what motivates people to do the max work here?  <br>I've also thought of adding an auxiliary list of minor tasks that I can refer back to when I'm bored.  This auxiliary list would be composed of things I might like to do but really don't require doing them in the near future or dismissing them.

It would give you an excuse to close this thread, if nothing else.  :-)<br><br>Here are some things that I think need to be restated / clarified:<br><br>5. All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out.<br><br>First - what is an "active page"?  It's clear to me now that this means all pages between today and today + 1M.  But when I first read the instructions, it wasn't so clear.<br><br>Second - "circulate round them" wasn't clear to me either.  I got the impression this was an area where you wanted us to experiment and process the list, "circulating round", in whatever method made sense for us.  So, I treated each page in AF1 fashion (less the AF1 dismissal rules); and I figured other people would come up with their own algorithm.  Turned out this wasn't what you had in mind.  Rather, you've now made it clear that you intended that we should go through each item in the list, beginning to end, and work on whatever items "stand out" / "feel ready to be done".<br><br><br>A few other things...  How do you begin each day?  It seems there are several things that need to be done:<br><br>(1) Dismiss/delete the tasks from pages before today's page.<br><br>(2) Experimental exception to (1), if you've been away from your list for a few days:  "Cross out all the days between the last 1-month page you put tasks on and the current 1-month page. Then you renumber the first day you missed to today's date, and the similarly renumber the 1-week page, then each day renumber the next pages until you catch up. That's much harder to explain in words than it actually is in practice! For example if you are away for the next 2 days (Feb 2 and 3), when you come back 1) delete Mar 2 and 3, renumber Feb 2 to Feb 4 and Feb 8 to Feb 10."   (I still can't figure out what that means, and it seems kind of tedious...  :-)<br><br>(3) Start processing the list at the beginning of today's page?  from the place you left off last time?   ???</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 2:10 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Right - I've taken the plunge and it seems to be going ok so far (although clearly I haven't got to the stage where items are starting to be dismissed yet).<br><br>I'm just using a notebook and writing dates along the top (bit of a hassle writing a month's worth, but now I just need to write in a new date each day).<br><br>I'm also religiously using 4 weeks (28 days) as the '1-month' point. Not much of a hassle working this out - I just move the 'bookmark' (folded down corner) forward by one day each day. As I mentioned elsewhere, this means that if the random gardening jobs I think of this Saturday as I watch the rugby ever get near to dismissal, the dismissal day will also be a Saturday and so I might have a chance of saving them from the chop.<br><br>Positives at the moment:<br> - Generally no single page (so far) ever has a huge number of uncompleted tasks, so I never feel overwhelmed when I turn to a new page<br> - I like the fact that, when I get there, there will generally be a 'bare minimum' of work I need to do to save tasks from dismissal - on really slow days saying 'I'll just do that minimum' might just be enough to get me started and for motivation to return<br>Negatives:<br> - Less effective as a filterless 'grass catcher' or task-dump, as you lose the benefit above, and also would run out of space on a day page<br> - I can see the process of physically turning through 28 pages might get irritating after a while</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 8:51 | Ed C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>TK:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Now I'm eager to try playing with different intervals. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Why?

So I just want to ask, is using 28 or 30 days fixed instead of a month close enough? Because its really easier to do digitally, and your reason for choosing the same day next month was ease-of-use on paper, wasn't it.

So if I filled Mar 4th I would start writing the tasks in Mar 5th and they would count as being entered on that day. Of course if this happens all the time you need a larger book!<br><br>&lt;&lt; - I can see the process of physically turning through 28 pages might get irritating after a while &gt;&gt;<br><br>We'll see. I've got 11 pages now, and it's not a problem so far.

I used a 28-day month for one of my earlier attempts at this system and I was always losing my place.

But to be honest, that was a significant part of my reluctance to start using the system. Having a compact, portable (A5), list was just too much of a benefit to give up in my view.<br><br>Although having said that, I don't generally 'dump' a lot of new tasks at once very often - So far I haven't added any more than around 15-20 'new' tasks on any given day (about half the page - leaving room for re-entered tasks later on).

But I don't have strong feelings about this. I just think that using a calendar month makes it easier to enter tasks, and doesn't make that much difference when the few remaining items are due to expire in a month's time. Add to that the fact that most business transactions work on a calendar month basis rather than a 4-week basis.

I pick the ones that seem the most urgent/important.  This should give me a "spread out" effect and each task will have the full 1 month trip.<br><br>2- I am having trouble keeping track of where I am.  When I reenter a task I sometimes put it at the end instead of the 7 day page.  It is not that I'm really that dumb, it is just that I get confused when I'm working.  (O.K. Mark, maybe I AM just that dumb ;-)<br><br>3- I don't ,know how you are handling the different number of days in the month but I'm just using the same day as today but next month for my entry point.  IOW, I will not enter anything on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of March until March 28th, etc. when they will take reentered tasks.<br><br>4- I like the effect of moving forward toward the new tasks rather than continually looking back.  This is clearly a psychological effect but I do like it.<br><br>5- The "drop dead" aspect of dismissal in this system is really more effective than the previous dismissal method.  I don't see why it SHOULD be that way, but it is.<br><br>6- I started using another Composition Book, but I decided to use a smaller Circa ring book.  It gets me back to a smaller format for one thing, but for another, there is a kind of feeling of finality in taking yesterday's page OUT of the book (and filing it elsewhere).  There is no looking back unless I want to get another book from the shelf and fish out an old page.  I keep the pages for reference and to provide me with a someday/maybe list but I'm not that motivated to rummage around in the archive book.  I'm thinking I might do that only once every month or two, at most.<br><br>7- Since my book is a smaller format and has 25 lines I divide the page in half to give me 50 "slots".  If I need more I think what I will do is use one sheet (rather than one page) per day.  This also will simplify the bookmark system and archiving system.  As it is now, with two dates on each sheet, the processes of moving the bookmarks and archiving is just a tad more fussy.  So if I use both sides of the sheet I'll have 100 small slots or 50 larger ones, depending on how this all shakes out.<br><br>8- The other advantage of the Circa system is that I have other scheduling and calendar sheets in the same book that I can add, remove, and move around as necessary.  So with the single book I can more conveniently carry, I have everything I need for scheduling in one place.  Nice.<br><br>9- Lastly, I think that in the long run it won't mater to the mechanics of the system on the numbers of days chosen.  Since I'm using dividers to separate "today", "reentry", "entry", they can be pretty much anywhere I want.  I can even go to Alan's idea of not using dates.  We'll see how it shakes out.<br><br>But that is the report for the first couple of days or so.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 18:00 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I really am loving this system. I am using a 3 ring binder and one-page-per-day calendar/list system. It has the time slots in half hours on the left, and plain old lines for a list on the right. <br><br>I am extremely dangerous in office supply stores, but my new love is Post-It Notes "durable filing tabs". (I was not compensated for that comment.) They stand up to re-positioning and stick out just beyond the page, but not out of the 3-ring binder. Cool! AND they are color-coded. (my little office-supply infatuation grows...) So I have four tabs down my pages: Feb, +7, March, +30. I reposition the +7 and the +30 every morning. THAT is working GREAT!<br><br>I haven't come to a day where I use up all my lines yet, but I expect it will happen. I rarely crack open my AF book on Sundays, so week to week, I will always have a blank page. My thinking is, if, say March 4 fills up today, because lots of things occur to me, then I will just continue writing onto March 5. That keeps those ideas going onto the list in the order they came up, but then I won't have 85 things that have the potential of being dismissed all on the same day. And then Sunday, usually a blank day, will kind of be the catch up place, so I'm not really moving all those tasks down and messing up the beautiful dismissal system so much.<br><br>Along those same lines, as I have "transitioned" into this new list, I purposefully avoided dumping my OLD list onto the NEW for that very reason. I would have had over 100 things expiring on March 2! Yeeks! So I originally put "old AF list" on March 2 (because I started on Feb 2), and that meant for me to cycle through my old book and put 10 things that stood out for me onto Feb 9.

If not, do make sure you have a stand (could be a few reams of paper) and scrounge a keyboard for your laptop at least, so the screen  is at the right height.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2010 at 13:26 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Annette:<br><br>&lt;&lt; When I'm at work, I have short periods of time when I can do something, usually only one or two tasks, eg a phone call or an email, or going out to buy something at lunchtime.

In one of those I got 15 tasks per page and so it could hold hundreds of tasks.  It fit right in my pocket with a 1/2 sized pen stuffed in the wire.  (a Zebra F-301, I think -- it stores 1/2 sized and then pulls apart to make a full sized pen when you want to write.  It comes in a fine point.)<br><br>Circa also makes a 3x5 vertical format ring book where you can pull out and archive pages if that is your thing.  With the wire spiral you just rip them out and trash them.<br><br>If you like, you could go with the hipster idea ... 3x5 cards clipped (a small "bear clip" works well) or punched to keep them together.<br><br>I went to the Composition sized book for a while and am now dropping back to a compromise between that and my 3x5 pocket spiral -- a Circa Compact.  It is about 4x7 and has the removable and pages that you can file in an archive notebook.  There are 25 lines per page and I am dividing the page in half to get two columns or 50 slots for tasks.  The advantage to that system is that it is small enough to carry and I can put different pages in it and move them around.  Lots of flexibility.<br><br>A simple steno pad is another option.  If you are a Moleskine geek, they make a "Reporter's Notebook" that is vertical format and just a bit larger than 3x5.<br><br>Options, options, options ;-)<br><br>BTW, I realize that these books are not dated but you can either date or number the pages to get the DWM system going.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2010 at 13:34 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Annette,<br><br>It sounds like you only use your list for small tasks with larger tasks and projects being handled in another way.  If that is the case, maybe the majority of your work and your time isn't really discretionary and this might not work for you.   If one of the AF versions was working well, why not stick with it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2010 at 13:56 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will:<br><br>I don't have time to consider tasks when I'm actually training - but I get about 15 minutes mid-morning and mid-afternoon, and then there's lunchtime.  This is when I need to grab a task quickly and do it.  <br><br>I don't have a separate screen or computer - just the machine I'm teaching from and demonstrating on.  I could set up an on-line ToDo list and look at it at breaks, but I've realised that I really prefer a book, something I have access to all the time.<br><br>Mike:<br><br>I've been using an A6 Adoc book (like Circa) for a while now (it's about 3" by 5", I think).  I like it because it's small enough to fit in any handbag, and light.  I like the flexibility of moving pages around, and also keeping other things in the book, like notes and important info.  The only problem is that I couldn't put multiple days on one page, as Alan suggested.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2010 at 14:04 | Annette</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Marty:<br><br>I break larger projects down into small tasks and attempt to control them in AF or this new system.
