It's old hat &gt;&gt;<br><br>Covey never said he was reinventing the wheel. He always paid credit to the original thinkers i.e. Dr. Viktor Frankyl, from which his 7 Habits were born. He was pushing for a deeper discussion, away from character-driven tips and tricks. That was (one of) his unique contributions to the field of productivity and self-growth.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2013 at 1:02 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Avrum<br>I never said that Covey was plagiarizing others' ideas.  I was referring to you and Michael expressing that planning and working based on your principles, values and passions and responsibilities is something new.  I assume that other productivity books didn't mention it because it was understood that people wouldn't abandon their values, principles, passions and responsibilities when organizing and planning their life.  Covey's roles were a unique idea but I found it redundant.  Unless you're mentally challenged or a willful criminal, then you're going to guide your life based on what's important and meaningful to you.  A system supposedly helps you to organize and plan.  The morality, hope and vision is an ongoing process of thinking and reference that guides you.  I can't even imagine that people who use systems, tips and tricks suddenly forget what's important and meaningful to them simply because it isn't mentioned by the productivity expert.  I guess we'll have to agree to disagree because I can't even imagine what you're saying is possible.  People are driven by what's important to them, what they believe to be true and what they think is possible within their values, principles, passions and responsibilities.  It doesn't need mentioning in a time management system.  It precludes it.  <br><br>But maybe I just can't see what you're suggesting as possible.  People learn productivity systems and abandon their own governing principles to living and planning simply because David Allen or Mark Forster didn't mention it?  That seems rather silly or quite sad to me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2013 at 17:48 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Avrum<br>I'm not trying to be disrespectful. I simply can't believe what you and Michael are suggesting. I'm no expert but I'd guess that almost all human beings actions and plans are guided by their values, principles, responsibilities and passions even if they modify them from time to time.  I can imagine conflicting values. I can imagine willfully ignoring them but I can't imagine forgetting them all together simply because they aren't mentioned. I'd imagine that most people are guided by them even when they aren't thinking about them.  Maybe I just don't understand what you and Michael are discussing.

Immediately it creates a thought.  If it pertains to anything you VALUE, by necessity, it will create an emotion.  Emotions drive how you respond. It's impossible to think about your values, principles, responsibilities and passions without some emotion(s) created. You may choose to ignore them but they are there.  It's impossible to actually have values without emotion. It's possible to unemotionally think about values that you don't embrace and don't contradict or threaten your own values.<br><br>To keep it simple, review Aristotle's "Rhetoric" as a companion to his Nicomachean Ethics. (Of course, Aristotle isn't the only person who has written about the interplay of ethics and emotions, but he happens to be my favorite)  Think of the word emotion.  Emotions drive AND guide your motions and subsequent thoughts even if they are relatively light or not noticed.  Even when somebody is deep in "dry" accounting duties, in the background a REASON and it's emotional component is driving him to bother with it at all.<br><br>Bottom Line: If you care about anything at all, there is a corresponding emotion or cluster of emotions attached to the thought.  The only way you can act is with emotion unless you're being driven by forces outside of yourself. The only way to avoid emotions attached to ideas or actions is to be ignorant of them or apathetic to them.<br><br>This is not entirely scientific fact.

How do you do that if you have been living by them for your whole life?  I can see adding values and learning them until they are second nature by reminding yourself and testing them my real life situations but learning them is not sneaking up on them.<br><br>If you don't value something (a character trait, an ideal, a person, etc ) why would you list it as one of your values?  Again, if you're trying to strengthen your use of a value and learn about it, then that will take awareness and effort for awhile.  Evaluate it to see that it in fact is a value you wish to attain or merely strengthen.  <br><br>Being stuck with a value until the next review?  As soon as you realize it's not a value that would benefit your character or your life, drop it ASAP.<br><br>I just can't imagine how people live their lives without being aware of at least most of their values.  When I have a value that conflicts with another value, that's a good teaching ground for learning how to implement your values situationally. The value isn't demoted permanently. Example: A sensative person asks how you like her dress.  Rather than saying it's hideous and totally unflattering, (honesty), you could say "It's not my choice for a style, but only you can choose what you feel best in." (Kindness).<br><br>Geez!  You learn this stuff since you're old enough to communicate.  Plus, there are better sources to learn this than a time management/productivity site.  There's not special instructions necessary.  You know when you're putting in an honest effort in your work.  You know when you're upholding or ignoring your values.  <br><br>I think you guys are just talking in circles about the same stuff.

Many people - and I include myself - grew up in families with poorly thought out values and principles. Clinically, I have noticed that this is consistent regardless of religion, culture or race. <br><br>For more on this, see Dr. Murray Bowen's ideas on Differentiation of Self</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 May 2013 at 1:43 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with Avrum -- it does help to tease out what one's values are and to think consciously about them. Not all the time, but occasionally.<br><br>I grew up in a family with Southern Baptist values and morals, which I resisted even at a very young age. But I didn't know *why* -- I didn't have the vocabulary or concepts to dispute them. So I went along with them because that's all I had. <br><br>I had no alternatives to explore for many many years, and entered young adulthood as pretty naive. I was living accd to my family's and peer group's goals and values -- instead of values that were more resonant with my temperament and personality -- and it caused me much pain for many years.<br><br>The last time I worked with a coach (winter of 2012), I had to do a values clarification diagram as part of the intake form. It was quite illuminating to me, even at my great age, to consider other values that I could choose to have. <br><br>So I don't think this discussion is a waste of time at all.

I'm in my first stages of practicing a mindfulness meditation each day. One thing that takes humility and perspective to admit is just how many emotive associations we can embody without even knowing their origin, whether we consciously recruited them or willfully subscribed to them. So, no, I do not associate something as a value of mine simply because I felt it or thought it. Nor would I throw my hands up and proclaim, "Mindful exercise? Are you kidding me? I have a mind, so anything I'm feeling or thinking is me being mindful, duh. People have been doing this for, like, ever."

I am guilty of mockery and I apologize.  I was simply frustrated going round this same loop by the same few. Again, I apologize for that.  Even though a person can't precisely articulate their values, they do feel the emotional component of them.  When I feel guilt when I'm working, that's my cue to reevaluate.  Either I'm forgetting something or I'm pandering to my desire to avoid boring work or being afraid to start something.  Even though it's a "negative" emotion, it works to get you to stop and think and have a do over.<br><br>Michael stated "The goal of productivity can conflict with the value of being peaceful and pleasant to colleagues, having less stress, devoting time to my partner.<br><br>Maybe values need more attention instead of all the achieve achieve hype."<br><br>I still don't understand how being productive would cause anybody to forget their sense of common decency toward others or forget their more basic values.  I think most people are decent.  I don't think being ambitious is going to blind most people away from being decent. Not being able to articulate your values doesn't mean you aren't feeling them.  I honestly don't understand the original premise that productivity causes people to abandon their values.  I maintain that acting on your values is done automatically no matter what you do even if you're choosing to ignore them for some reason.<br><br>If I sounded pretentious, I apologize. I honestly didn't intend that.<br>I also recognize that my mockery was unkind. I was willfully guilty of that. I apologize for that also.<br><br>Expect typos because it was embarrassing to write this....the mockery part.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2013 at 9:55 | learning as I go</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
