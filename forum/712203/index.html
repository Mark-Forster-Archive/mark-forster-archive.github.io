I only put in a few number of words in each item entry just as a way to get the thought process going and then draw specific task lists up for each area which I can manage as though a mini AF list.<br><br>Sometimes I draw it freehand, sometimes using Mind Manager software, I have a regular item on my main AF list to review project XXX and then just refer back to the file and all my data to progress is there, anything time sensitive around it will also be entered into my schedule as a reminder/alarm ahead of its due date as a fail-safe. <br><br>I have found that mind maps have given me a really quick way to quickly refresh myself of the overall aspects of the project when returning to it after a short while, an effective way to demonstrate a project to a colleague/client and an early warning system to highlight clashes, possible time/resource issues, and even another way to do it.<br><br>Hope this helps<br><br>- Titch</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 April 2009 at 6:09 | titch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Pick one project and make sure that your first task every day is to do something to get it moving. After a week or so you should have some momentum.<br><br>(Straight from DIT)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 April 2009 at 6:47 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi TK<br><br>Do you realise just how many people are now going to be humming that song ......... !!<br><br>For me techniques that try to "make" me do something at a regular time always create resistance.  I find the best think is to "attach" motivators to it.  MindMaps are a great way to start a project in a "fun" way - giving you permission to use colour and doodling and if you transfer it to digital you can add "motivators" by the use of words, background etc.<br><br>It is important to remember that motivators need not be "business like".  Playing motivating music (Eye of the Tiger ????) can be a tool, as can say, for me the scent of coffee with cinnamon.  The first may be more difficult in an office but the second may not.  Find what helps you ......<br><br>One key motivator for me is to "see" progress.  the way i do that with difficult project is by keeping some form of progress chart or statistics.  For example one project I have at present is to sort an immense amount of digital data spread over several computers and numerous hard discs, identifying what at present seems to be an infinite amount of duplication.  It is one thing when it is your own file structure but identifying files structures of others is interesting ....... A relatively boring task is progressing nicely - when in stands out, for as long as I feel like, but whenever I go back I know where to start.  Similarly, I have lots of active AF pages but a very nice spreadsheet identifying statistics.  The number of active items or pages doesn't phase me because I can see what I have completed which is an amazing amount.<br><br>So often when we have a project we look at what still needs to be done - that can be highly demotivating.  Instead we need to look at what we have achieved to date - and just improve on it .....<br><br>TK - when you are in the position of being on the edge of burnout the MOST important thing is to ensure you don't get any closer to that edge.  You absolutely MUST take steps to avoid that.  Where AF will help will be the fact that everything is recorded in one place - that can significantly reduce feelings of overwhem.  An exercise to get you started - <br><br>Identify a place where you can both think and work calmly - may not need to be a long term option but can be somewhere like a library or coffee shop.  Find a motivator, music, smell of cinnamon etc.  Go fo a 10-15 walk - get some fresh air - play Eye of the Tiger on headphones if you like!) but get fresh air and don't concentrate on what you're thinking, just enjoy the experience - even if it is raining!  Take a fresh notepad and go to a place where you can think - preferably outside your normal working environment such as a coffee shop.  Relax, and when you feel ready just use your notebook to record your thoughts, identify tasks for your list, think about how to plan your projects with motivators built in and enjoy the time ..... There is a top hotel near me with a coffee lounge.  The atmoshere is instantly calming.  For £3.95 I can enjoy a pot of tea or coffee, with a freshly cooked cookie, in a comfortable sofa, with no distrations for as long as I wish. Amazing.  Just getting outside my environment to plan without everything clamouring for my attention is priceless.........  When you get back to your normal "work" place, ensure you have your motivators - music, smell of cinnamon, .... whatever you identified at the start of this exercise ..... <br><br>Remember also, when you are close to burnout your attention span is drastically reduced.  The temptation is to think "I should be able to work on this for x long ..." but the fact is that you can't.  Work with AF using "what stands out" and just "for as long as you feel like".  Create your "progress monitor"  - as you start to see progress you will start to get that old excitement back - and realise that your attention span is increasing.  The backlog project I am close to completing would have totally defeated me at the outset of AF ....... Burnout is not something to be ignored - but CAN be avoided.<br><br>Best of luck ....  <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 April 2009 at 11:59 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>TK, if you're on the verge of burnout, I would take a weekend break at the earliest opportunity.  I do this to step back and get perspective on what's upcoming.  Use the first day to do something physically challenging.  In the morning on the second day off, I would sit down with a pad and pencil and brainstorm:<br><br>What's critical that needs to be done - and what's just optional / nice to have?  What can be put off until after my deadlines are met?<br>What can I get someone else to do?  (What doesn't require my expertise?)<br>What do I need to get the ball rolling on ASAP so I'm not scrambling at the last minute?<br>How can I make working on the projects more enjoyable?<br><br>Eliminate the stupid meetings that people schedule during your busy time.<br><br>Clean your desk and just have out what needs to be worked on right now, it will focus your mind.<br><br>Consider varying your work hours if you can.  I used to work in a job with a lot of interrruptions (also known as managing a team).  I started work at the office at 6:30 a.m., worked on my own stuff until everyone else showed up at 8:30 - left at 3:30, came home, relaxed a bit, then hit the computer again from 6-9 or so.  It worked well and I never really felt as if I was actually putting in 11+ hour days.  Take the time at lunch to get out of the office.  Take the time to have a meeting with your group (or yourself if you work by yourself) every morning to update progress and brainstorm some more.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 April 2009 at 14:04 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks everyone for the helpful suggestions, I am a graduate student so it is a deadline-driven thing where I'm regularly put in situations where I'm having to be extremely reactive and also drive long range projects forward.  These suggestions will help.  Hopefully to others too.  <br><br>Pardon my ignorance as it's probably been discussed elsewhere before, but does anyone have a good example of a MindMap??<br><br>As an aside to my Eye of the Tiger song selection, I'm not much of a fan of the song but one of my friends is really not a fan of the song.  At a basketball game during high school, one of the baskets broke.  Someone had to leave the game to get the repair pieces needed at a hardware store.  Play was suspended for about an hour.  And the high school band only knew one song......Eye of the Tiger.....which they played over and over and over until the basket was repaired.

It's loaded with great ideas to help formulate your plan of attack with one/several projects.  My entry is on page two called the 17hour crunch.  True, it's a bit extreme but it works brilliantly.  Of course, you can shorten it to smaller units of time.  The basic steps are<br>1. Plan a worklog that keeps your mind in flow with planned breaks in the form of work that rests your brain yet is still moving you forward.<br>2.  Have your breaks established for meals and a couple of temporary windowns and bathroom needs.<br>3.  Allow NO INTERRUPTIONS and follow the work log plan as though your life depended on it.<br>4.  Set your determination to HIGH and HARD.  DARE YOURSELF to complete the mission in the timeframe allotted.  When you begin to flag, visualize the carrot!  i.e. money, killing deadline dread in your brain, personal satisfaction to see yourself through a tough challenge, etc.....whatever keeps that fire in your belly!<br>Hey, it's not pretty and sweet but it gets the job done.  If you set up your work log well, you'll surely triumph!  The trick is to foster and maintain a flow state using  naked determination to succeed as it's partner.  Hey.....there's nothing wrong with exerting yourself to regain peace of mind, beat the competition or make money, yeah?  I don't understand why people think I'm doing myself an injustice to ask a bit extra of myself now and again.  True, pleasurable work feels different than difficult work but it doesn't necessarily make it superior.  Some work is going to be hard or it gets done faster when you ask more of yourself.  I don't see the harm at all.  In fact, once I'm over the hump, the victory dance makes it all worthwhile!  LOL!  Plus, it creates a great memory to refer to when you begin to doubt yourself.   Building Self-Reliance and Confidence is priceless!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 April 2009 at 18:57 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>oops, I forgot to post the link.

Also, this is one of the rare contexts that  manual scutwork could be considered almost zen-like!  The physical rhythyms relax your mind while you simultaneously think about other aspects of the project.  I can't count how many strategies were formed in my brain while walking the dog to relieve herself, sweeping floors, washing dishes or cutting vegetables.  Ordinarily the boredom of these tasks could make me feel restless.  In this context, they serve a grander purpose!  LOL!  The same applies here.  Usually when I work with wood or metal, I resent the periodic cleanup.  When I use it to stoke my brain, It becomes a form of bliss.<br>Thanks for mentioning this.  Lots of people look at me like I'm daft when I try to explain what you just posted.  Thank you!  We could call it "guilding the scutwork"! ! !

This is basically answering the question "I don't want Y, so what DO I want?"<br><br>For example suppose you had as a Don't Want: Have to travel to work every day. Your question is "I don't want to travel to work every day, so what do I want?"<br><br>Depending on who you are, your answer might be:<br><br>Agree with my employer that I can work at home<br>Start my own business <br>Retire<br>Get a job nearer to home<br>Move nearer my place of work<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 April 2009 at 15:26 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have been finding some good success lately with Mark's "tricks" such as: <br><br>'There are many tricks you can use to fool your rational mind to overcome resisting some tasks. For example, if you need to write an essay you might say out loud "I am not going to write my essay, but I will read some notes and write two sentences".<br><br>Choosing the descriptions of the tasks can put a new spin, for example using the word "Just": "I will just get this file out". I procrastinate over doing things associated with personal finance. A good strategy for preparing a budget would be "I will just summarise the insurance policy premiums for next year".'</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 April 2009 at 20:07 | Bev</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
