It is first system after my years-long experimentation, with which I am really satisfied and productive. It uses combination of three sections - daily tasks, ticklers, superfocus. I use Things for Mac, which I honestly recommend after testing tens of apps for both Win and Mac. But it can be easily implemented on paper or other app also.&nbsp;<br><br>See screenshots for better&nbsp;understanding:<br><br>daily tasks - <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/1968/dailytasks.png">http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/1968/dailytasks.png</a><br>week focus - <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6836/dailytasksweekfocusexpa.png">http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6836/dailytasksweekfocusexpa.png</a><br>inbox/last page in superfocus - <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/3855/inboxsuperfocuslastopen.png">http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/3855/inboxsuperfocuslastopen.png</a><br>superfocus/active page - <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/2735/superfocusactivepage.png">http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/2735/superfocusactivepage.png</a><br>ticklers - <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4171/ticklers.png">http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4171/ticklers.png</a><br><br>1) Daily tasks (Things: Today view) - tasks I would like to do today. I include here not&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;classical important/urgent tasks (which goes typically to superfocus), but tasks which I would like to focus on today from any reason; also daily chores, repetitive and little tasks and memos etc. Typically, there are not more than 10-15 tasks here, which I continually remove, add and change as day runs.&nbsp;<br><br>Visually, I&nbsp;split daily tasks into several sections (see screenshots):&nbsp;<br><br>(a) ROW - most current tasks (horizons of minutes and tens of minutes), which I want to focus on&nbsp;precisely&nbsp;now. I do not use this section always, only when there are more current tasks, when I have distracted attention or when I want to do many things at once. Name it "ADHD aid" or "working memory" - as you want :-). At other times, this section is empty.&nbsp;<br>(b) OTHER DAILY TASKS - which I sometimes ad-hoc visually group by any context or characteristic which is useful. Sometimes I have only one bunch, sometimes I have more groups of tasks - e.g. tasks to do when on the walk, tasks connected with Project A, household routine tasks etc. &nbsp;<br>(c) SCHEDULED - tasks, which is best to do in some specific day time, but are not so time sensitive like appointments. E.g. &nbsp;"buy bread" (when&nbsp;going home from work), or "visit my friend" (in late afternoon, app. between 17 and 20). I put these tasks in visual order from earliest to latest (I do not specify the time, it is obvious for me). When reviewing, I just look at the first task in the row and when it is still not time for it, I am sure that I do not have to check/do all the other tasks in the section. Sometimes there are 3-5 tasks in SCHEDULED section, sometimes only one or none, depending on the day. And of course, when necessary I can move task from SCHEDULED or grouped daily tasks to ROW section to do it now or schedule it in a moment...&nbsp;<br>(d) DISTRACTIONS - section for quick braindump - when not sure whether the idea is valuable enough to be added as a new task to superfocus or everything what comes to my mind when I do not want to be&nbsp;distracted&nbsp;during&nbsp;current&nbsp;focused activity.&nbsp;<br>(e) WEEK FOCUS = only one task (holding this name) - all week goals are added as&nbsp;notes of this task.&nbsp;Clicking on this task expands notes section, allowing me to review them, but also to hide them so as not to be distracted during the day (see screenshot).<br><br>2) Ticklers (Things: Scheduled): All tasks (a) scheduled for specific future day, (b) to review/decide/remember on specific future day (c) to force myself to do on that day etc. Very suitable also for repeating tasks, household/maintenance tasks etc. Ticklers for today are automatically moved to Daily tasks by Things.<br><br>3) Superfocus (Things: Projects) - for majority of my tasks. Superfocus pages are made by Projects in Things (AF1, AF2, AF3...), with only exception of last (open) suprefocus page, for which I use Inbox. When there are 23 tasks in Inbox, I move them to new SF page/project and start again with empty Inbox. Tasks which belongs to superfocus "second column" (C2) are tagged by triangle symbol on the given page/project. The page I am currently working on is marked with "&gt;" prefix. When at least one C1 task is done, I change the prefix to "&gt;&gt;" (meaning that I can move to next page if nothings stand out). I adhere to most SF rules, with several exceptions: (1) I do not move unfinished task to C2, but usually to last page (Inbox in Things) = I add only urgent/focus tasks in C2. (2) I try to work on all C2 tasks before moving to next page, but in some cases (not suitable time/context/mood) also not - I move them to next page as C2 without working on them, (3) because the system is electronic, I do not apply rules for dismissal when both columns are full, nevertheless I try to limit number of C2 tasks.<br><br>Working in superfocus: When I work on task, I mark it by "NOW" tag. When finished my work on it, I either delete it or move it to last page (Inbox) or define next task/step (also in last page/Inbox). Unfinished C2 tasks are of course moved to next page. I have special tag for tasks which are open (started and needed to be checked/continued later but I am not actively working on them at the moment - e.g. downloading big files to computer, washing laundry). When I have such task tagged in current page and I want to move to next page, I move them also to next page like C2 tasks.<br><br>Using the system: In the morning - quick review of calendar, today tasks (which are moved from ticklers automatically), review of week focus and nearest ticklers -&gt; defining new daily tasks + grouping them to sections above. Working during the day - alternating Today view (daily tasks) and Project view (superfocus) and working on both types of tasks, trying to push as many activities as possible to superfocus section.<br><br>I am sorry for the length of my description. This system works swiftly, it is not as complicated as it may seems from this long story :-). I will appreciate your comments/questions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2011 at 22:12 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Daneb.<br>This looks simple and effective.<br><br>The way you create "pages" in batches of 23 might work for email too. I.e., when the Inbox reaches N items, move them into a new email folder to process as a closed AF page. That is especially attractive to me, because though I really prefer a paper system for my tasks, I am forced to use an electronic system for my email!<br><br>(Well, not *forced*, but who wants to hand-copy all their emails?)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 November 2011 at 1:08 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie, yes - speaking about the paper system, especially when I saw photos of AF pages of those with nice handwriting. I would love to use it for my tasks and tried it many times. But I have so ugly handwriting + I cannot stand looking on clutter of many crossed out tasks - and I realized I prefer nice looking lists... So I am using electronic. With combination with Things iPhone app it works. Some things (adding, switching on) takes longer than on paper, however the clarity of list is more important for me.<br><br>Using AF for emails - yes, when you have really lots of emails, it can work. Good idea!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 November 2011 at 8:32 | Daneb</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
