My entire calendar is in there as my staff and program associates have access to it for scheduling meetings, so it makes sense to go ahead and use the tasks function.  So far, I think it is working very well.  I think my biggest problem I was having with DWM is that I just did not like the paper diary I was using and could not find one to my liking.  <br><br>So let's see how this goes.  When I did pure GTD, my entire system was digital, so this is not virgin territory for me.  <br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2010 at 20:45 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Okay....had to run to a meeting and did not have my AF4 notebook with me.  I forgot to print out my tasks from Outlook.  Sigh....never mind....I am going back to AF4.<br><br>I too like to test things, tweak things, but to a point, I am being very counterproductive.  I WAS AND AM happy with AF4 and I should just stay there and quite playing around with things.<br><br>Sorry for the ridiculous posts and rants on my part.  I do think I need a vacation.<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2010 at 22:01 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Speaking from experience, and suffering from similar "systems addiction," it's amazing how much you can get done when you just pick one and start doing those things that make your world go round.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2010 at 22:17 | Brian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David,<br>I always read your posts and see how much you are trying to give DWM a chance. I also have a similar impulse. Trying to make GTD work for me was a good experience, I  did lost a lot of time. I am so happy with AF4.  I read once more the answers to the poll you made, and I find some tips I will try to use, like this one from Sairey "My current rule is that when I start writing on the 8th page, the oldest active page is dismissed." Anyway, I appreciated your posts and by no means think they are ridiculous.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 February 2010 at 0:59 | Silvia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Silvia,<br><br>Thanks -- that was very gracious of you and I appreciate the very kind remarks.

They require an investment of time to learn  before they pay dividends in time saved. They also require an ongoing investment of time to maintain. It is sometimes hard to quantify the return on the investment.  In theory if you spent no time on time management, 100% of your time would be available to actually do things.  However, for me, without some system in place, I would forget things and it would reduce my effectiveness and cost me time.  So I look for the simplest way to make sure I don't forget things.  Obviously everyone has their issues and should make sure their system addresses them.<br><br>Additionally, as Mark has mentioned, if you are over committed no time management will solve this.<br><br>I appreciate the laboratory like quality of this forum since it is with experiment that we will all find what works for us.<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 February 2010 at 15:53 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry - <br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;Additionally, as Mark has mentioned, if you are over committed no time management will solve this.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Actually I am expecting DWM to help me do just that.  It's been hard for me to see where all the overcommitment is, and where all the tasks are coming from.  DIT was good for identifying those things, to some degree, but failed (for me) because of its inflexibility.  DWM addresses that issue, and is helping clarify the areas of overcommitment more effectively than AFx did.  Re-reading DIT probably helped too.<br><br>Regarding the overhead / ROI of ramping up on a new time-mgmt system -- I have really liked AF and DWM because that ramp is so minimal, and the ongoing overhead is negligible.   (Unlike GTD, Franklin Covey, and so many others, at least for me.)   In fact I'd be happy to switch to almost anything Mark comes up with, since there is always a productivity boost just because of the novelty of the thing.  <br><br>Maybe that is Mark's meta-system behind all the experimentation with new TM systems -- keep experimenting, and with each new iteration you'll get a productivity boost, in addition to whatever else is learned along the way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 February 2010 at 21:12 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>Interesting thought.  Are you self employed?  For me work is the huge "time block" in my life and all else get the leftovers. I am trying to find the ways to improve efficiency to free up time for other things, but unfortunately there is still a certain amount of face time employees must do.<br><br>Regarding ROI, I agree the common theme with all of Mark's systems is simplicity which allows for a quick ramp up.  I never got the two years to GTD blackbelt idea.  It seems like too much to ask.  When I read the GTD forum occasionally, it still seems like people are having struggles, tweaking and still trying to sort out systems.  I think some of it is due to the complexity.<br><br>There seems to be more innovation going on here and a breadth of ideas.  Other systems are more rigid.  It would be hard to calculate, but I am sure there are lots of people using systems which actually are a net negative to their productivity.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2010 at 0:15 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gtd was net-negative for me while it lasted,<br>on account of I spent much time over some months mastering the implementation, and never actually arriving. Problems included not satisfactorily grasping the Organize phase and how it fits with Process; staying consistent with Collect and Do; and consistently neglecting the weekly Review. <br><br>In short, Everything was problematic!  I think Allen's focus is on the mark but the implementation/system is a hopeless mess.  I still very much like reading Ready For Anything, only every time he gets to a specific practice I sub in one of Mark's suggestions because those actually work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2010 at 0:42 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry - <br>&lt;&lt;&lt;Are you self employed?

Generally I have a good idea of how to manage that workload and to be effective there.  I don't feel overcommitted (or undercommitted) at work.  Yes, it's the big time block in my life, too.<br><br>The problem is, I have lots of other important things to which I try to attend in the remaining bits of time -- six children (that would be enough said right there); church life; tech support and marketing for my self-employed wife and daughter; goats and chickens and garden (though the kids have taken over most of that); local political activism; and constantly dealing with health issues.  Not to mention participating in the ongoing philosophical debates over on Mike's list in my "spare moments".  ;-)<br><br>AF (and DIT and DWM) have all helped me to prune some other commitments which I've already dropped from the list, but the remainder is still too much, especially when the health issues flare up.  DIT/DWM have already helped me see where some of the problems are.  I'm hoping as the first 30 days start to roll over, it will increase that focus even more.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2010 at 20:23 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Roger,<br><br>You can use the Outlook task list as a perfectly functional daily task diary, as Brian and I have found.

(what field do you use to flag that they are "next pass" tasks)<br><br>I spend a lot of time in Outlook and would like to see if I can make it work as a DWM list.  But it's rather awkward since IT imposes retention limits on the In Box (.OST) folders, but flagged items in the personal (.PST) folders don't show up on the Task Bar / Task List.  <br><br>This always seems to push me toward two lists -- one for Outlook tasks, OneNote tasks, and flagged emails in the .OST file; and another one for flagged emails in the .PST files.  But DWM doesn't work so great with two separate lists -- they need to be integrated into ONE list.<br><br>I'm trying to see if I can put all one-off tasks in the .OST, and project-only tasks in the .PST.  That way, I can have tasks in the .OST that say "go review the project folder in the PST".   But I still keep running into the retention policies in the OST.  If I keep anything for 35 days it gets automatically deleted.   And if I go over 225 MB it shuts down altogether.<br><br>Any ideas?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2010 at 5:17 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>Yes, I'm using Outlook 2007.<br><br>I added a couple of user defined logical fields for "doing" and "next pass".

But all the tasks due next week are in order as one long page so it is about the same thing ... to me at least.  I'm not sure if some custom search might fix it to make it as you like.

I think that will serve the purpose.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2010 at 2:07 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I did the following trick to get some visual context of the next 7 days and 4 weeks for my digital implementation.<br><br>For the upcoming next 7 days add "-" as a daily delimiter with the respective due date set. If you use DWM in the office and don't want to use Sa/So only add the delimiter for the next 5 workdays. To get the delimters sorted in after all the real tasks of the respective day set the priority to "-1 Negative" if you use Toodledo (sort by due date, priority). If you use MLO set the time part in the due date to 11:58 pm instead. <br><br>For the upcoming next 4 weeks add ".========== week ============" as a weekly delimiter with the due date set at the end of the respective week. In the office Friday is my end of the week. At home I set it to Sunday. <br>Again, to get the weekly delimters sorted in after all the real tasks of the respective week set the priority to "-1 Negative" if you use Toodledo. If you use MLO set the time part in the due date to 11:59 pm instead (1 Min. more than the daily delimiters). <br><br><br>When today is over just forward the due date of todays "-" by one week so it helps to divide the updcoming week. Thus with each passed weekday you get one more delimiter visible in next weeks time frame. If the week is over forward the due date of this week's delimiter by one month. <br><br><br>Pros:<br>+ You get a pretty good visual representation of the due tasks during each of the next 7 days and during the next 4 weeks. <br>+ You see days or maybe even a week where no task are due (this is a real fine feeling).<br><br><br>Cons:  <br>- Your number of tasks is not really correct any longer, as the delimiters are counted as tasks as well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2010 at 6:07 | kneitinga</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Kneitinga,<br><br>I do something similar in ListPro by using colour shading (Four + None, which stops overload from too many colours):<br><br>Routine (Daily, Weekly, Monthly): Green<br>Closed List/Today: Yellow ie for NON-Routine tasks<br>1 - 7 days: Purple<br>8 - 28: None<br><br>To delineate the Closed List, I use a text only/no date in Blue<br><br>This arrangement is working as I see the "looming" Purple and tackle them to minimise the fear factor (see Alan B's thread).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2010 at 9:09 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will:<br><br>If you are using Toodledo  and want to see all your tasks listed day by day, for the coming month, as you would in a page-a-day diary, try using the calendar view.  Each date on the calendar shows the number of tasks due that day.  When you click on a date, a list of those tasks appears below the calendar.  This way you can view your tasks as a series of closed lists, just as though you were using paper.  <br><br>Unfortunately, I don't think the calendar view is available on the iPhone - although I don't know for sure, as I don't have one myself.<br><br>HTH</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2010 at 9:51 | acedia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I downloaded Pocket Informant Lite, an iPhone app that syncs to the Toodledo website.  This one seems awesome.  It has a configurable display for todos.  The mode I like shows in a single sectioned list these sections: Due Today, Due Tomorrow, Due within a week and Due within a month.<br><br>You can also go to calendar view, (which isn't good for entering todo's; it's for appointments and meetings) that can give you an overview of tasks and counts, if configured that way.<br>I haven't put my stuff in yet, but I think I will.
