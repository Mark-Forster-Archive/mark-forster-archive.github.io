I've been lurking for some time, but thank you to everyone here.  I've learned some great tips and advice through this forum that have increased my productivity and, more importantly, decreased my stress level and improved my health over the past two months.  I thought I'd share how I'm using an autofocus-inspired system in the hopes that it might help those of you just getting started.<br><br>Firstly, I should mention that from 2005 to 2009, I attempted to follow the GTD methodology at work and home.  I read the book, started using paper lists, and diligently processed my inbox, defined my goals, and planned my products.  I thought I was in control, but the "stress-free productivity" many GTDers have touted never came.  In retrospect, my four years with GTD was one of the least productive times of my life.  I accomplished a lot during that time, from purchasing a new home, planning my wedding, and going back to school, but these goals could very well have been done without GTD.  Most recently, a career change (and an increased level of project management) prompted me to realize that I needed a better way of managing a high volume of tasks without unnecessary overhead.<br><br>Enter Autofocus.  After two months, my head is clearer, the single list gives me an overview of all commitments, big and small, and I'm better able to adapt to a fast-paced work environment.  The little-and-often approach keeps me on task and ensures that my work moves forward.  Best of all, the system disappears into the background and allows me to focus on doing.  I feel as though I finally have the freedom to think about my work rather than of it.  I will admit that I don't practice true Autofocus, but the descriptions below are heavily influenced by it.<br><br><br>Work:  Autofocus and Outlook -<br>Like many companies, we use Outlook 2007 for email, calendaring and tasks.  Although Autofocus was intended to be paper-based, I've had a good deal of success in using Outlook's Task list.  I keep things very simple.  New tasks are entered into the list and given a due date if appropriate.  Any notes go in the notes field.  Although not required for Autofocus to work, I assign each task to a category (client) to better track my work for billing purposes.  Any emails I that need a reply or action get flagged and appear in the list.<br><br>The trick is in the sorting and grouping.  I sort the tasks by the Date Modified field.   Every time I work on a task I will usually update the notes field to mark off where I left it.  Sorting by Date Modified automatically moves the task to the bottom of the list.  Alternatively, I have found that simply dragging the task to the calendar to create an appointment (I use the calendar to track billable hours) results in a resorting of the list.  Accordingly, working on a task is simple.  After deciding which task to work on, I drag it to the calendar and create an appointment for it.  The task moves to the bottom of the list.  If I complete it, I go ahead and mark it as complete; if not, the task remains at the bottom for the next time I work on it.  At the end of the day, I'm left with a record of where my time went during the day.<br><br>The concept of pages is handled by the Group By feature.  My task list is set up to automatically group by Date Modified.  My current groups include "Today, "This Week", "Last Week", and "This Month".  Each of these groups functions as a page.  If I work on a task from the Last Week group, it is automatically moved to the Today group at the bottom of the list.  Because I have a filter set up to show only non-completed and non-deferred tasks, the grouping disappears when all tasks in it have acted upon.  I use a variety of automatic formatting features to highlight which tasks are due today, not ready to begin, or overdue, which helps in prioritizing my list for the day.  A simple search for all tasks with a "Deferred" status allows me to reevaluate whether an item should be made active again.  I don't use a backlog; rather my list tells me that if I haven't touched a task in the 2 weeks or so, I should probably either work on it or defer it.  <br><br><br>Personal:  Paper Notebook and Calendar -<br>For personal items, I am using a Moleskine Weekly Planner &amp; Notes, which has places to mark appointments on the left and a ruled page on the right for notes.  As I think of things to do, they get added to that week's list on the right.  However, this is where my method differs from traditional Autofocus. Each week only gets one page.  At the start of the week, I mark any old pages containing incomplete items with a sticky tab and begin entering new items on the new week's page.  So, right now, I've got about 4 pages of active tasks going (the oldest being a month old).  I work the list starting with the oldest page first.  If I work on a task from a previous week, I will reenter it under the current week if I didn't complete it.  However, if I work on a task on the current week's page, it will stay on that page.  The only time I will enter tasks in a future week is for things I need to do in the future but cannot start yet.  I haven't experimented with the DWM method, and don't use my planner in this fashion. <br><br>With my personal system focused on the weekly level, it allows me to see how my tasks are progressing, how old some of my work is, and to plan for the future.  While not strict Autofocus, the motivation to move tasks off of the previous weeks' pages has helped me get more accomplished.  I don't have a great deal of personal tasks, and limiting the number of times I need to rewrite a task keeps my work confined to just a few pages (Plus, if the current weeks' page is running out of room, it's a good sign that I've taken on too many new commitments and I can pace myself for the rest of the week).<br><br><br>Whew!  That was a long post.  Thanks to those of you who stuck with me.  I hope some of my methods give others a few ideas to try.  <br><br>Thanks!<br>Stewart</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2010 at 15:37 | Stewart</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for sharing Stewart.  I will review this system but that will take time because you've written a lot.  It appears to have much in common with DWM and AF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2010 at 16:02 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wow Stewart - a lot here to digest.
