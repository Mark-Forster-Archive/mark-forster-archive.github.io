It is based on many scientific studies including her own. She mentioned that if you only take one thing away from the book it would be to specifically plan when/where/how you will implement your plans, rather than being vague, so that you can take advantage of times when you can make progress on your goals. For example, if you want to keep in better touch with your mother but for some reason you never get around to it, you might decide that you will call her on the phone after dinner on Sunday. Once you do that your brain is essentially pattern matching and as soon as you are in that situation, you almost automatically do it when the time comes. She calls this "if-then" planning.<br><br>I just searched for and found this article specifically about if-then planning: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://99u.com/articles/7248/how-to-use-if-then-planning-to-achieve-any-goal">http://99u.com/articles/7248/how-to-use-if-then-planning-to-achieve-any-goal</a><br><br>There is a shorter version of "Succeed" called "The Nine Things Successful People Do Differently" that I might recommend except I haven't read it yet. It appears to cover the same topics in less time with more of a focus on implementation rather than discussing the science in detail.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 May 2016 at 13:38 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Having just read the first few paragraphs of WOOP, it reminds me of Future Vision vs. Current Reality, such as in Mark's "Dreams" book:<br><br>"'Think positive!' quotes are nowadays found everywhere, but contrary to popular belief, positive thinking about the future leads to poor performance and success. Research over the past 15 years finds that dreaming about a desired future leads to low investment and little success, regardless of life domains, such as health, work, and interpersonal relationships. In order to benefit from positive thinking about the future people need to incorporate in that positive thinking a clear sense of reality.<br><br>Mental Contrasting (the Wish, Outcome, and Obstacle part of WOOP) is a visualization technique that incorporates this sense of reality: It helps people to gain insight into their wishes and to clearly identify the obstacles that stand in the way of realizing these wishes. WOOP is an evidence-based self-regulatory strategy that people can use effectively on their own to change their behavior across everyday life (e.g., health, school, work, play, relationships) and across the life cycle (e.g., from childhood to old age)."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 May 2016 at 23:12 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Don R:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I'm almost done reading a book called "Succeed" by Heidi Grant Halvorson &gt;&gt;<br><br>We've discussed this book before:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1575622">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1575622</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2016 at 7:18 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(W)ish, (O)utcome, (O)bstacles, (P)lan.<br><br>Without the P, it is merely WOO.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 May 2016 at 4:26 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I wrote about WOOP last year and Dr. Oettingen actually helped me edit the instructions I'd included. She was incredibly helpful, so if you have specific questions that aren't covered in her book, she might respond if you reach out to her directly.<br><br>From recollection, it's really a combination of two different techniques. The first involves contrasting a visualised 'perfect outcome' with a mental picture of yourself struggling with the most likely internal obstacle. For reasons I'm unclear on, there's a focus on internal obstacles rather than external factors, but it's important that you picture both events and don't focus solely on fantasizing or dwelling on problems.<br><br>The second part - the Implementation Intentions, is essentially the if-then planning that Don mentions.<br><br>There's also some discussion of the technique in Prof. Richard Wiseman's book 59 seconds.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2016 at 21:00 | John</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This looks very similar to something I did in a change management course ten years ago.<br><br>You group the team around a large sheet of paper with today's date on it and lead them through a brainstorm of the current world, with specific observations relating to problems they face.<br><br>Then you add a title: "How things used to be"<br><br>Then you take them to the other side of the room, to a large sheet of paper with an end date on it, and the title "How things are now" and lead them through a brainstorm of an ideal (or at least, significantly better) world.<br><br>Then you run a tape from one sheet to the other and on this, add a sheet of "the problems we solved to get here" and sheets on "How we solved problem A", "How we solved problem B", etc.<br><br>The "How we solved..." become the first draft of the plan.<br><br>I've never had the opportunity of doing this with a team, but I did use it for my personal planning at one point.<br><br>It worked reasonably well.

Unfortunately, I also have to monitor my thoughts because I sometimes find myself subconsciously looking for "innocent" escapes.  LOL!<br><br>As I've mentioned before, one of the most important skills I've had to learn (and use quite frequently) is getting myself back on track.  Yes, this involves determination and sometimes excruciating amounts of effort.  <br><br>I'm partially embarrassed to admit that this skill is often times my most important and most used workaround.  It also gives the much needed confidence to be able to write my WILL DO list.  Sadly, I often find myself taking a circuitous route.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2016 at 13:34 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>I often find myself being angry at myself becuase of this.

Squarespace just tried to nudge me back to work by freezing, but my drift factor is too strong! &gt;<br><br>I hear ya.  That’s one of my prime beefs.  Sometimes I don’t even realize that I’m in a trance but luckily, my conscientiousness does seem to break through.  To be honest, if I aught to be working, it doesn’t last nearly as long as after I work.  I’ve lost lots of time “researching” and mindlessly clicking.<br><br>&lt; This does nothing at all for my self esteem. &gt;<br><br><br>Overall, it doesn’t hurt my self-esteem at all because I didn’t order this trait at birth.  Genetics gave it to me. I figure it’s a tradeoff for the benefits I also get living in this quirky brain.  IF I CAN GET ENGAGED, I can usually work longer and faster than “normal” people.  It’s great for problem-solving, creating and planning.  I tell myself that it evens out in the wash. But it is a time hog and a cognitive purgatory... each and every time.  That’s why I always must start early enough to compensate for it.<br><br>What infuriates me is that having this high drift factor and extreme aversion to boredom makes the very jobs that I DREAD take far longer to complete because I can’t engage.  I also HATE having to expend massive amounts of determination and effort to get it started and finish it. It is a STRUGGLE!   It feels like I’m willingly holding my hand in a fire!  If it’s truly boring enough, my eyes glaze over the work and my brain stays sluggish.  That’s why I always have to start early enough to compensate for the extra time it takes to get the job done.  <br><br>In my career, I was known as the 11th hour artist because I was FAST and DEPENDABLE compared to the other medical illustrators.  Ironically, I got paid very well by my procrastinating Ph.D.’s and MD’s clients.  LOL!  This work INTERESTED and CHALLENGED me.  OTOH, if they gave me a boring schematic, graph or chart to do, it took me forever to complete it in comparison. Boring or not, I always meet my deadlines.  The difference is if I have a complicated and challenging medical rendering handed to me at the last minute, I’ll finish it with little stress.  Heck, it I get really engaged, I might have enough time left over to go dancing.  If they give me boring schematics and such, I’m locked in the house all night doing the work and alternating it with other work.  I CAN’T DO THAT STUFF STRAIGHT THROUGH.  I need other jobs and breaks to be able to get it done.  It’s been like that all of my life.  Bottom line: I hate the extra time it takes and I hate the struggle to make myself keep on with it.  I CAN do it and I CAN do it on time.  I can also jump off a bridge or set my hair on fire.  That’s the category I put boring jobs in.  At least they feel like that.  LOL!<br><br>&lt; After a drift episode, I often find myself becalmed and halted. I do find that writing down what I have done on my focus list does seem to help me to rebuild momentum. &gt;<br><br>I must have a WILL DO list to give me determination and a definite target.  I’ll break it down into sublists with a few other relief tasks thrown in.  I do NOT mix pleasure or trivial tasks with my list.  I don’t need that kind of temptation.  When I feel my frustrated brain starting to leak out og my ear, I simply take a break.  I must be vigilant as hell about what I do on my break.  I use Leechblock when I need to.  Yes, I can be THAT vulnerable.  LOL!<br><br>&lt; Yours in the continuing quest for effectiveness. &gt;<br><br>Thanks, but I don’t think I’ll ever be any good at surmounting boring work.  Mark’s DIT principles help me tremendously. I am so grateful that he wrote that book! I never knew that I could to my dreaded work in any order and work on it incrementally.  It was a revelation!  I modified DIT to suit me but I hold to the overriding principles and forget the rules that don’t match my personality.  Mark has never chided me for doing it my way. Some of the other gurus aren’t nearly as open-minded as Mark. I only wish Mark wrote DIT in 1956 when I first started school.  My entire life would have been far easier!   <br><br>I only hope that you aren’t as hard a case as I have always been.  IOW, I hope that there’s hope for you.  <br><br>For me, it will always be a frustrating struggle.  Eh, it’s far from the hugest challenges in my life.  It’s really only a huge, agonizing PITA. LOL! My stubbornness and conscientiousness have always managed to keep me on the straight and narrow despite the antics of my glitchy brain.  I’m OK settling for that.<br><br>As Roger used to say, “A Luta Continua!” (the struggle continues)<br><br>p.s TIMI?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 May 2016 at 14:58 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>learning:<br><br>A vitória é certa.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 May 2016 at 15:18 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>By coincidence I had been contrasting my AF1 list (my "wishes and fantasies list") with my no-list "actually going to commit to" plan which had the effect of making my avoidances/obstacles rather clear!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 May 2016 at 21:35 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>michael: "By coincidence I had been contrasting my AF1 list (my "wishes and fantasies list") with my no-list "actually going to commit to" plan which had the effect of making my avoidances/obstacles rather clear!"<br><br>By coincidence also this is how I work SuperFocus, where "Column 1" is my "wishes and fantasies list" and "Column 2" is "actually going to commit to list".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 May 2016 at 0:48 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark<br>"A luta continua, vitória é certa"<br><br>God bless your kind soul.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 May 2016 at 3:25 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi michael and nuntym<br><br>I must admit that I envy the both of you.<br><br>I'm so weak-willed that I can only work off my work list.
