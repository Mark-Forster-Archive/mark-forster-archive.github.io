I am generally happy with how things are going.    <br><br>I like the fact that the list requires no management at all and is always up to date. I'm going to really start thinking more carefully about how I word the items on my list.  <br><br>As Mark had suggest I had been wording them as manageable chunks of what I imagined a finished item to be.   Something like "Finish 'chunk' of project A".  <br><br>I really hadn't been phrasing them as questions and that is a bit of a change of direction and I will see how I get on with that.  Its really hard thinking in questions!  Hopefully practice will help.  <br><br>I have today decided to make a tweak to my system.  I have come to the conclusion I do need a someday maybe type list.  However, I'm definitely do not want this to become overwhelming again and a dumping area for everything, so here is what I am planning on doing.  <br><br>In my work calendar I have created a recurring appointment with myself called "Reduce the 10 Spot List".  This happens on the last Friday of every month at 4.00pm.<br><br>I've used the notes section and have the following in it<br><br>RULES<br>* There are only 10 spots in this list, use them wisely  If you want to add more items you MUST remove an item.  <br>* This list is only reviewed once a month.  <br><br>1.<br>2.<br>3.<br>4.<br>5.<br>6.<br>7.<br>8.<br>9.<br>10.<br><br><br>I envisage this list more as a very brief reminder of items that maybe off the agenda now.  People keep telling me about future projects / things that don't require to be dealt with now and I just feel I need a long term bucket.  <br><br>How is everybody else getting on?  <br>Newguy</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2015 at 9:01 | Newguy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Newguy:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I really hadn't been phrasing them as questions and that is a bit of a change of direction and I will see how I get on with that.

It's been interesting. My first list included "Mail".<br><br>In the past, this would have been a ten minute scoot through a hundred or so items bulk copied from my inbox into my WIP folder, adding perhaps five tasks to my FVP list and then bulk copying them to my"2015" reference folder. Maybe fifteen minutes. And only actioning the genuinely urgent.<br><br>This time, I spent over an hour working out how to feed my inbox into my mental picture of my commitments. Time well spent, and I added it to my list of jobs done for the day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2015 at 10:48 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark, <br><br>I find your book very interesting. I encourage everybody to read it. <br>I have carrefully red chap 9. The system is interesting. I only have 2 questions <br><br>1) would it be better to maker the list at night before going to bed for "letting the brain work subcousciously"<br><br>2) You said "not to feed the list with another list. The problem is that I have numerous crucial project. Bulding sells is by nature impredictable. So I use things (I grot rid of omnifocus) for collecting clients name or ideas about each project (wich can be eitheir a client, a building or an obligation). If I dont feed it I may forget a crucial thing such as a client. What would be the best way to deal with this ? I would you do it ? For my self I would keep the system as it is in the morning and when I will add some tasks I would go to the project and feed it with elements I may have forgot. If there are none I would get another project. Am I wrong ? What do you think about it ?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2015 at 10:59 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter:<br><br>&lt;&lt; would it be better to maker the list at night before going to bed for "letting the brain work subcousciously" &gt;&gt;<br><br>Well, let's follow what the book says. First, you need to rephrase the question as a "how" question or questions. So you might use one or both of the following:<br><br>"How can I best get my brain to work subconsciously on what I need to do?"<br>"How can I find out it whether writing the list at night would be best?"<br><br>Ask yourself the question(s) over a number of days as indicated in the book. Then construct ways of testing the answers.<br><br>&lt;&lt; You said "not to feed the list with another list. &gt;&gt;<br><br>In the same way construct questions, develop answers and test the results. Remember above all that you are aiming to develop a stable system which you won't have to change again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2015 at 11:33 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, <br><br>I think I've missed something here. What is the reason for writing out batches of tasks in advance, rather than listing what you have done? You talk about the benefits of reviewing what you actually did, and adjusting as necessary.

I would like to share with all a thought process I ran on the issue of productivity in 2 posts.<br><br>"What are the systems that I need to have in order to be productive?<br><br>These are my initial thoughts<br><br>- System to track delegated tasks<br>- System to keep in view emails and documents pertaining to ongoing files<br>    - For example, emails, documents<br>- System for reminders<br><br>What is the platform I want to use for implementing those systems?<br>What are my existing systems?<br><br>- Eaglefiler<br>- Evernote<br>- Calendar on Mac (Busycal)<br><br>Is there a need to streamline these systems?<br>Should this platform be something I have access to on my Mac and my mobile devices?<br>What the types of emails I get?<br><br>- Those that need a response<br>- Those that are to be kept KIV when attending Court.<br><br>System for  KIV emails and response email<br><br>what is the best platform to keep those emails?<br><br>- I think that would be Evernote<br>- With a tag called matters to KIV or similar.<br>- Handwritten Notes can also be kept about a particular file<br>- Just all notes in one tag, no need for separate tags<br><br>Decision: So for matters to KIV, use Evernote. For reply emails, flag and keep.<br><br>System for delegated tasks<br><br>What is the best platform for this?<br>     Again I think its evernote<br>When you delegate a task what are the steps you would take?<br>What is the evernote system you would set up?<br>     A single tag called “delegated”<br>     With intermediate reminders.<br>     With reminders is Evernote, you don’t want to be checking too many tags or notebooks.<br>     So, how about using a single notebook titled “Delegated &amp; Reminders”?<br>     That would work I think.<br>Decision: Set up a single notebook “Delegated &amp; Reminders"<br><br>System for checking inbox emails and flagged emails<br><br>What is the key concern here?<br>     That emails in Inbox are checked and dealt with, as a workflow.<br>     That flagged emails are actioned.<br> Is is better not to flag response emails, because they remain only on the Mac, can be dealt with when I am offline or out of the office?<br>     Yes, I think so<br> So what is a better method?<br>     Response emails should be kept in Evernote, then responses can be done when away from the office.<br>     If further information is required from file, then deal with it when you are in the office.<br>So, what do you do with existing emails in the Inbox?<br>Do you mark them all as unread?<br>Then deal with them 1 by 1.<br>With a view that all current day and yesterday emails must be dealt with.<br>And backlog deal with 1 by one?<br>     Yes, I think so.<br>What is the system to transfer email from mailbox to evernote?<br>     Do reply, then cut and paste to evernote.<br>     Better method: Send email to evernote, to that particular notebook you create<br>     Create a notebook, Emails to respond<br>     Save them there.<br><br>Decision: Create an evernote notebook “Emails to respond”, then redirect emails<br><br>How will these emails be actioned?<br>     By drafting the response in evernote.<br>     Transfer them to AAA if so required.<br>     Or cut your response from evernote, and locate the email and reply to sender.<br>     A system is required to have a task for “response emails” and “Inbox” emails<br>How do you ensure emails will be checked regularly for Inbox items?<br>     These can only be done at your desk.<br>     Because you don’t want to be checking emails on the go.<br>     It’s not possible in any event, because of the POP system for office emails.<br>     So best way is to check inbox early in the day.<br>     First thing in the morning before the day starts.<br><br>Decision: Check emails regularly"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2015 at 14:33 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My thoughts in the first post above are disjointed as you can see. In my 2nd round I found myself more focused, with a few action steps I want to take. I won't be stopping here. After setting things up, I'll see whether the workflow is efficient, or needs to be changed.<br><br>What systems do I need to have in order to be productive?<br>What are the systems I have identified so far?<br><br>Firstly, the email system<br>In the email system I have decided that the thing to be done is as follows:<br><br>- For emails requiring a response I would send them to an Evernote notebook called "emails"<br>- I would draft my replies there<br>- Then send them out or transfer them to AAA if needing approval<br><br>Secondly, my KIV system. This is as follows:<br><br>- Send  the email (by emailing Evernote ) o r transfer the document to the "matters" notebook. Transfer by drag and drop.<br>- Yup that's it!<br><br>Thirdly, my system for delegation and reminders.<br><br>- I have set up a reminders notebook in Evernote.<br>- I will use this to set up intermediate deadlines for following up with colleagues.<br>- And to set reminders for myself<br><br>And so, now I have three systems. Emails, KIV system and delegation/ reminders system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2015 at 14:43 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Mark.<br><br>I find that one of the main functions of the task list was to enable me NOT to do things as they came up.

My brain is like gelly and I am un able to go next. I got rid of this difficulty taking notes on a special paper notebook where I list everything Waiting for, ideas calls, appointement results absolutly EVERYTHING one by one day by day one under the other. Often usually twice a week I read the list color in green what I attend from other (it is the only color I autorize to my self in this list) and so I cross done items. When I am "stuck" I just take the elements from the list and report it on the short one. In the short I noticed that I often report a group of task relative to a project ie I write project X then Do this and that and that....) is it just a checking list it goes faster in action. <br><br>My question may be delicate... Do I do it right ? My questionning say yes.... But you are the author of the method so I do you do yourself ? <br><br>Thanks kind regards</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2015 at 12:59 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I follow my thought about the system<br><br>One of the biggest difficulty is "to keep a narrow focus" and "go for essential" <br>I have so many projects, so many tasks to do in each project that "questionning" is complicated. <br>However, I found a solution (sorry if it dont follow the method or if it is ok with it I have not finished the book wich is huge ! I am ch 17 <br><br>So for focusing as timothy Ferris said I found one solution <br>extracting my "No doing list" or "remember list" ie the one wich collect everything day by day 2 lists. <br><br>The one is the "core list" which contains my engagement by now :<br>I have an item wich is "work on dossier portfolios of smith's building" - do the building analysis on excel. It is one of my strategic priorities <br><br>I also have a secont list wich is my "non subjects" list ie all subject which draw my attention but which are not on my engagement by now. They may be in the future but at the moment they are just items to remember for may be a future decision. I found it usefull because it doesnt bother me as I know that these subjects are collected somewhere. <br><br>Here is an example "My project FMP because the developper I have contracted is making fun with me" Well I am furious about this... I wonder if he is an escroc or not...<br><br>All others items of my daily note book, my bord journal are considered as eliminated. <br><br>So with thes 3 list all is under control <br><br>So my question Is it OK whith the method ?

Reading your book makes me realize that I choze a wrong way these years. Wanting beeing too rational and organized pushed me on organizing instead of doing. When I began to work (about 30 years ago) I was more axed on business and acting. It was often cao or almost in my organisation, my desk was un tidy, I was rushing everywhere but the results were incredible. I made also a mistake take strictly methods like GTD or COVEY from the beginning to the end. But I learned a lot and it helps me now for the future of my own system. <br><br>Today of course life is more difficult, but some basic principle stay the same. Your book is quiet huge I think it would be better if it could be smaller. But the basic principle it explains is incredibly powerfull for people like me who are entrepreneer and who a reaching for productivity (in you sense) <br><br>As it is very long I have not finished to summerize it Sadly. I think it will take almost 2 or 3 weeks to fully understand and apply the method. But I can say something yet. I have never red a book before since H mac cormack (what you will never learn at harvard business school) which is so interesting and so incredibly operational. <br><br>So congratulation ! <br><br>I used to play the guitare with a wonderfull teacher. Once he told me some brings a little stone on the wall. Some others like Endrix brings a all wall. I think you did the same. You brought a all wall ! <br><br>For really understanding the book I think it must be summerized and made in excutive summary. I began to do this step by step. <br><br>I am still building MY METHOD. It is founded on basical principle and process. <br><br>I test the task system and did it since one week. The result on paper is incredible. It was the most productive week I ever spent for years ! I have engaged 5 deals in the week. A lot fell but it is the game. I notice it free my time by 3. It lets me time to write a little on your website ;-) So I simply decided to throw away anything that is not on or relative to my core business. IE making deals.<br><br>Now questionning force me to shoose the right path about visionning what I will do acording to the real and basic reality. I am on the way. <br><br>For the moment I dont do it on computer except for projects with evernote because I would be overwhelmed. But the core system is on paper. <br><br>So this is my testimony. Hope it will help people reading this and taking time reading you book</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 October 2015 at 9:49 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Jupiter. That's great. (And don't forget to write a review on Amazon!)<br><br>The layout and length of the book was decided by the publishers not me because it is part of a series of similar books.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 October 2015 at 10:58 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>After a few days of experimentation with this system I seem to have settled on the following process, which I thought I would share.<br><br>In violation of Mark's rules, I am using a Master List in addition to the five-task list. It's a grasscatcher. My work simply has too many moving parts for me to be willing to trust them all entirely to my remembering them when I need to (or forgetting only the ones that didn't really need doing). <br><br>On the other hand, I am NOT feeding my five-task list from this master list. I'm selecting tasks for the five-task list precisely as outlined in the instructions. Occasionally, the task that suggests itself is "scan master list" or "spend one hour cranking through tasks on the master list", so that's how the two lists interact. This also means my memory of what's on the master list is kept refreshed.<br><br>If a task on the five-task list generates a follow-up or a "waiting for" task, etc, then it goes on the master list. So do "someday/maybe" thoughts etc.<br><br>This obviously does damage the "purity" of the question-asking part of the process, since having recently consulted the master list is likely to skew my selection of tasks. But for me I think that damage is worth it for the benefits of not forgetting tasks. And I think most of the power of the five-tasks system is retained. <br><br>(And since Mark does allow "reminders for specific items" in his rules, maybe I am not even really disobeying, but instead interpreting that phrase in the broadest way possible, by keeping a reminder of EVERY specific item I can think of…?)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 October 2015 at 15:25 | Jeff</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>At one point in the book, I believe Mark suggests that 5T is to be used in one's discretionary time.

I totaly agree. I could use a data base, or even put it in my active projects on evernote (which is nice because it makes me focus on my projects have a global area of focusing.

Right now, in the (not very early) morning, my five tasks read:<br><br>- breakfast [in progress as I write]<br>- converse on blogs [which I'm doing right now]<br>- rise [which will be up to and including walking the dogs]<br>- follow grid [the grid is my day plan - which actually just means: Do three one-hour sessions on my commitments]<br>- go off-grid [just follow my nose and the 5t list]<br><br>As written, this looks like one excessively general 5t list for the entire day, but in fact it will be continually replaced by new and more specific 5t lists.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 October 2015 at 9:48 | Chris Cooper</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Chris,<br><br>Good to know someone else is using 5T for all tasks.  It's interesting that your "follow grid" task seems to comprise your main work focus –&nbsp;so you're not really using 5T in the way Mark describes it, right?<br><br>I do something similar with my routine (morning, work-arrival, work-departure, evening) checklists. I enter each as a single task in 5T, even though it comprises several minitasks. <br><br>Right now, my 5T list contains:<br><br>21. Browse MFnet forum<br>17. Exercise core<br>–––––––––––––– 09:00 ––––––––––––<br>19. Try q-phase compression of sim data with unw/hann/cda (without added noise first)<br>20. Contact ClintW about earthquake insurance?<br>22.<br><br>I use an electronic system (Clear.app) and number each task as I enter it. As you can see, I do allow myself to action the tasks out of order on occasion; right now I'm procrastinating my exercise routine (17) by hanging out on this forum (21).  I also have hourly separator bars and unnumbered reminders for stuff I think I will do during the rest of the day.  This works well with an electronic system, since it's easy to slide tasks into position as I commit to them, and slide the hour bars up as time slips by. I add a numbered entry with no task listed each time I complete a task, to maintain 5 rows; this makes it easier to notice that there are only 2 tasks left with three blank numbered lines ready to be filled.<br><br>I guess we're both using 5T to augment our own systems.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 October 2015 at 17:01 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Right now my system runs with 2 list<br>1) core list ie list I MUST do ASAP ie the most quickly possible. <br>2) wish list ie everything I which or may do it is a whare house of things I won't do right now<br><br>During the day I drop what I feel must doing and first at all,  I number (1) from 1&gt;5 doing the most important first and trying to estimate how much time it will take. Then I cross little by little. <br>The core list is NEVER more than ONE PAGE. I must read it at a glance.... <br><br>yes I know it is NOT the original method....

I shouldn't give the impression I follow 5t and my day-grids with determination - I fall off the wagon a lot. At the end of the day the number of tasks on my 5t list that I've ticked off [US: checked off] is absurdly small - most of the things I've done didn't appear on the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 October 2015 at 10:00 | Chris Cooper</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Based on all the (very helpful) discussion here, I bought a copy of Mark's new book and am trying out 5T. So far, so great! I have a lot more focus than when using a long list of all my commitments and feel a greater sense of accomplishment and of being in control. I'm looking forward to continuing to see how it goes.<br><br>Thanks to all of you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 October 2015 at 17:17 | Lenore</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just finishing about explaining what's happened using the new system. <br><br>When I start reading the book I said to my friend J... That i found the book light and un consistant. I was wrong. I read a ton of books about productivity and organisation. I spent hours and hours studying systems. And what else ? <br><br>About the task system. Even if I was almost suprised about the system I admit after 1 week that the result is simply astonishing with me. I did almost all what was important getting rid of almost a 90% of my stuff. The result is a best clarity about what I did, a great result on a core project and a real productivity. <br><br>There is something which also changed my life. It is the chapter about skimming. Befor I red any books from the beginning to the end making summary. Now I dont I realised that I did not need all that using MF method is indeed suffisant and I dont take any notes except for some core principle<br><br>At last the questionning system is unbelievable. It has a huge effect on my life at every level. <br><br>So as you see I am really enthousiastic about the system. MF book is really a new approach about stuff and productivity. It is more instinctive. It is more on the flow and less about controlling, organizing and building strict systems. His approach is perfect for people like me who are in the core of business and action. <br><br>GTD was incredibly usefull for years but it is for me too strict, too tidy too robotic...<br>I love MF system because it is in the flow of life. <br><br>Now I am engaged in buiding my own systems. It is my own way of perceiving life. It is not a question of technology even if it helps. My system will be may own way of life and for the moment what I have buildt works... Very well !<br><br>So Just Thank you Mark.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2015 at 20:23 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter:<br><br>Great stuff!<br><br>Don't forget to write a review on Amazon, or wherever you got the book from.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2015 at 21:52 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I will ! <br><br>I noticed a tip I naturally do wich work very well with me. Instead of using a piece of paper or a notebok for joting the new tasks as explained by MF I use a piece of paper coming from a little white paper bloc. Then I cross one by one according the rules. I often give a lot of vision on what I write ie instead of saying "Projectx" I says "Work on project X to obtain this results and add this and that... Make control at this time and another at this time. + questionning about this..." It is just a guideline. At the end of the day I will report what I have done on my paper book and cross a line at the end of it as MF in his own journaling. This let me a summury of what was the most important thing about the subject and stay constant and regular about it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 October 2015 at 9:47 | Jupiter</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
