Here's the site I referenced:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.constructiveliving.org/works/fountain.html">http://www.constructiveliving.org/works/fountain.html</a><br><br>Here's an excerpt (I will break them up) pulled from the above site and just some thoughts / questions I had:<br><br>"Attention must be focused on reality. Reality is the proper teacher of life's lessons. Observation of reality results in information about what needs to be done (i.e., purposeful behavior). When what needs to be done isn't clear Constructive Living action can suggest only to do what is clear. That is part of the reason for the structured nature of Zen monasteries. One's situation, when properly structured, presents what needs doing in relatively routine and clear fashion so that attention can be invested in doing activities well. The simple and organized life reduces the attention necessary for deciding what needs doing."<br><br>I totally agree that when your life is simply structured, it is much easier to identify what needs to be done - because something like a messy bed in an otherwise pristine room will stand out as needing doing.  But what do you do if you're not starting from that point of order.  ie. starting from some chaos?  If I'm in a work situation (like this new contract I just started), I can create order from chaos easily - I just kind of gather information and absorb data for a few days or whatever, then wait for the answer for the first steps of what to do to come to me.  But usually that's simple only because I don't have a lot of emotion attached to the situation.<br><br>But say you have a situation that's chaotic yet you avoid dealing with it (ie. avoid dealing with reality I guess?).  How do you get from "there" to "here" - what's the mental shift in CL?  In other stuff I've done, it's "choosing what is" (kind of like accepting or even embracing the situation).  But I have a hard time making that shift with some things.  And it doesn't seem to work for me necessarily to come just from action like CL seems to advocate (seems to be an "act as if" way)?"  I have had way more consistent results in the past from making a change in some of my fundamental beliefs.<br><br>Any thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2010 at 16:49 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for starting this thread, Jacqueline.<br><br>May I ask a few question, please? What does "reality" mean in Reynolds' context? Is his "reality" everything that happens anywhere, or only things you can perceive right now where you are? Is "reality" meant in a subjective way (individual and depending on the observer) or in an objective way (no observer is necessary for the existence of reality)?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2010 at 17:38 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just some opening comments. The _Handbook for Constructive Living_ is his best work to date.<br><br>Rainer, regarding reality, this is a difficult subject, but the nuances are not too appropriate for the practice.<br><br>If you would like to discuss this in depth I would love to. It would be a long conversation about the lack of sophistication of Eastern thought when dealing ontology and the folly of most Western thought regarding the same.<br><br>But in short, to think in terms of subjectivity or perception as a starting point is a non-starter although that is how most Westerners would approach the nature of "reality". That is not to say that such phenomena do not inform the world, since they are inherently part of it, but they are derivative states which rest upon a more primordial relationship of the world which resists reduction.<br><br>But I think going down this route would probably be unfruitful for getting at what Reynolds has to offer although this understanding of the underpinnings does inform my practice of both AF and CL. Which might become a bit obvious in the discussion I am having with Alan.<br><br>In short, Reynolds lacks a sophisticated definition of such ideas, partly due to the prejudices of his own tradition coupled with the near absence of it in the traditions he is attempting to bring to the West. Thankfully such a thorough investigation into such matters has a small return on your investment.<br><br>Reynolds is attempting to use this non-reductionist view of the world (which includes you and has a rich and non-trasparent relationship with each other most of the time).<br><br>"Reality" becomes can be what you understand subjectively, but if you diligently practice CL, you might find yourself doing your part in world in less than transparent manner (for the most part you already are.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2010 at 18:07 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>How do you get there from here?  Generally I tend to plan a route, but an easier approach is "low hanging fruit". In context of a messy office that means either the biggest obstrution or the easiest thing to clean up. AF is exactly the right tool to get this done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2010 at 18:09 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman wrote:<br>"If you would like to discuss this in depth I would love to."<br><br>Thanks for your offer, Norman, but I have to pass. This matter is far too complicated for my simple mind. It's just that I can't know what is real, I can only perceive the interaction of my existence with other existences. But I've made up a believe system that helps me navigate in this world. It's an illusion, but it works.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2010 at 19:11 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey Rainer,<br><br>I haven't done enough reading on Reynolds' work to provide a definition of "reality".  But from my previous experience in only slightly similar work is that reality is the facts of a situation - without any meaning attached to it.  <br><br>Re. meaning it's kind of like "the room is messy" - not any meaning that you assign like "the room is messy because I'm a bad person, because I hate housecleaning or because my kids are little brats that never clean up after themselves."   <br><br>Alan, I think where you're coming from is how I sometimes come from things too in areas, but I've been contemplating this a lot lately and where my biggest breakthroughs have been are where I kind of took the focus off the tools, so to speak.  <br><br>If I write something on an AF list like "file xx papers", "sort through junk mail" blah blah blah - I get stuck in that way of thinking (typically being that a) it has to get done and b) that I have to do it and probably take 5 hours to do it too) when what I want is to come at it from a clean slate to think of ways to get what I want done "ie. a peaceful, clean office".  So to get to peaceful, clean office from messy office, there's a world of ways to do that - do your stuff like biggest obstruction or easiest things, could also hire a cleaner, invite a few friends over, or just sweep it all into the recycling bin (yes, I have done that and nothing blew up), leave it for a month and see if you need any of it.  When the month goes by, throw it out.<br><br>So where I'm getting confused perhaps is how AF can enable this mindset?  The vision as opposed to the task?  Unless what's on your list are the visions.  And lots of question marks.  <br><br>Rainer, I wonder if whether we feel that the subject is difficult or not is also our own meaning attached to the concepts themselves.  I guess they can be simple or can be difficult.  It's like when I do it at work and tell myself there's a simple answer to something - you just don't know what it is yet.  Or they're difficult until you get it and realize how blindingly simple it is.  <br><br>Usually if it seems hard I think it's because the author explaining it doesn't know it well enough to explain it simply or the teacher doesn't care enough about the students to put it in language they understand - I had a genius math teacher like that in high school.  <br><br>Norman, I'll have to put your post through my translator and figure out what it means.  Or maybe it will all become clear once I get to read your response to Alan B. on the other thread.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2010 at 19:41 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My attempt to summarize part of Norman's post: The question of what is meant by "reality" is a complex subject, and fortunately it's not one that's critical to a useful understanding of Reynolds.  <br><br>I don't understand what is meant by "transparent relationship" or operating in a "non-transparent manner" though.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2010 at 21:38 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan, I got that part but the rest I don't know.  I'm just a farm girl.<br><br>Transparency in business means nothing is hidden, full disclosure.  Loosely refers to honesty too.  <br>I think the term means something else in computer-ese.  Something like the processes that run in the background. Which is kind of similar to the business wording. <br><br>So this: "Reality" becomes can be what you understand subjectively, but if you diligently practice CL, you might find yourself doing your part in world in less than transparent manner (for the most part you already are.) <br><br>means something like:<br><br>"Reality" can become what you understand as a concept which is different than the actual reality of reality itself.   But if you diligently practice CL, you might find yourself interacting with the world less honestly, which you already are.<br><br>OK, clearly I'm not any good at this translation stuff.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2010 at 22:30 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;And it doesn't seem to work for me necessarily to come just from action like CL seems to advocate (seems to be an "act as if" way)?"

I've been a devotee of Reynolds' "water" books and the Handbook of CL. (Many of his books are available for reading online from his web site.)<br><br>One of the CL mottos is "Accept your feelings, know your purpose, do what needs to be done." Rather similar to the advice "eat when hungry, sleep when tired." I believe that would be Reynolds' definition of reality. He cites the founder of Morita therapy (one of the two therapies that form the basis for CL) as monitoring his temperature when he was sick. He would do physical work till his temperature reached a certain point, then do non-physical work until it climbed to a specific mark, and then would simply rest when it reached a higher mark. At each point, he was using reality as input for his decisions and actions.<br><br>(I think about Mark Forster's oft-related measurements for his weight, web pages, timed bursts, etc, as being similar reality measurements.)<br><br>I suppose the AF list could be construed as a reality-meter of sorts -- these are the tasks I have promised to do. How many have I done or can I do? Do I feel frightened or shy about doing any of them? Does it need doing? If so, then I do the task feeling frightened or shy about it, because reality tells me it needs to be done. If it doesn't need doing, then I don't do it.<br><br>That's a VERY simplistic interpretation of AF through a CL lens, and do NOT decide CL's merits based on this explanation. It's just the best I could do in this off-the-cuff response.<br><br>Insofar as dealing with reality and chaos, I think Reynolds hypothesizes you're on your way to an important interview, and then you get a flat tire, and then a policeman tickets you for out of date inspection stickers, etc. At each point, reality is handing you a challenge, and you have to decide what is your purpose in each moment (which in this hypothetical is constantly changing--get to the interview, change the tire, don't yell at the policeman :), accept your feelings, and do what you need to do.<br><br>Thanks for reminding me of CL and Reynolds -- I enjoyed remembering that stuff.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 April 2010 at 2:02 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have been interested in CL for some time and am pleased to see it brought up here, in the context of how it may relate to AF.<br>Two comments;<br>-a great site/organization that is about CL and Living On Purpose is The ToDo Institute.

Yes, I do have that book. It is quite marked up and underlined...one I like to refer back to often. So I do recommend it if you are drawn to the idea of Living on Purpose.<br><br>One thing that I really like about the ToDo/CL material is that you (I) don't have to WANT to do something to do it. I often want to wait until I am in the mood before I tackle x,y or z. And this material puts such an interesting slant on this and one that helps me to see that this is actually quite an immature emotional position to take. I love this quote "behavior changes feelings".<br><br>I like the ToDo newsletter as it is nice to have something to read, on paper, rather than electronically, for one. It is nicely presented, simple, relaxing material. I always find myself feeling either reflective or more peaceful upon completing it.<br><br>Also, I just checked out Lieder's article and site.

So, I certainly do not pose as an expert.<br><br>As much as I can I will put aside, at least for this post, any editorial comments on what I think of CL. I will simply try to answer the question you pose.<br><br>CL is not about doing anything or everything. It is about doing that which "needs to be done." When I have reviewed my AF/DWM lists, it was usually clear to me when I was avoiding what needs to be done. If I approached those lists from a CL perspective, I would start doing those items which stood out, meaning they needed to be done, whether I felt like doing them or not.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 April 2010 at 18:24 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey moises, what's wrong with editorial comments?  :-)<br><br>Thanks for the input, I agree with you that this is the approach that should be taken. I'm afraid that with my use of AF, I went on auto-pilot much of the time so didn't really give myself time to think or contemplate the tasks.  (Which is kind of useful too since you don't really look at it long enough to determine how you "feel" about it, you just do it.)  So mechanically speaking, do you look down the list and look for the items that "most need to be done" or weight them against each other in any way?  <br><br>The CL approach certainly requires a very significant amount of mindfulness applied to a list of things to do.  I imagine it's worth it though.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 April 2010 at 19:17 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It may be that we are talking about different things when it comes to "what to do next". I am saying I often struggle against the task, not wanting to do it for whatever reason (resistance, laziness, fear, etc.). I think, Jacqueline, you are saying you do it "because it is on the list". Or perhaps some variation of this...<br><br>I am one of those who is very good at creating systems and not so good at maintaining them, i.e. the doing part. What I like about the CL/Living on Purpose approach is that it gives me a new way of looking at my own resistance. While at it's simplest it suggests to "just do it", it actually offers an explanation of why I don't (usually) "just do it". And my mind is such that it likes those reasons for why I do, or do not, do such and such.<br><br>From that link from the ToDo site:<br>"One of the main tenets of Morita Therapy is that our internal experience (feelings and thoughts) is basically uncontrollable by our will."<br><br>So the tenants presented here are not so much about deciding what it is that one should be doing, but rather how to work with the will in getting to the doing. The What of it is determined someplace else.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 April 2010 at 21:14 | Beth L</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The full quote is helpful in better understanding this whole approach, so I thought I would post it here:<br><br>"One of the main tenets of Morita Therapy is that our internal experience (feelings and thoughts) is basically uncontrollable by our will. If we feel anxious about going for a job interview we can't necessarily make ourselves feel relaxed and confident. If we experience doing our income taxes as frustrating and tedious, we can't just snap our fingers and suddenly find the task satisfying and exciting. Most of the reasons for procrastination have to do with "internal barriers," like fear, anxiety, indecision, perfectionism, etc. I call these barriers the Demons of Inaction. Traditional therapies generally suggest that you must conquer such demons through various strategies such as insight, self-talk, motivation, or increased self-esteem. But Morita Therapy offers a set of tools that is less about conquering and more about co-existing with. Rather than vanquishing your anxiety about the job interview, you simply take your anxiety along for the ride. Western therapy suggests that we must exorcize these demons before we can take action. Morita therapy recommends that we accept their presence, as unpleasant as that may be, and move forward anyway. If you can learn to do this, the demons lose much of their power and many of the causes of our inaction naturally dissolve into constructive effort."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 April 2010 at 21:17 | Beth L</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Beth,<br><br>&gt;&gt;It may be that we are talking about different things when it comes to "what to do next".

In hindsight, I guess it was just healthy procrastination saying "you've had enough."<br><br>It's not that I'm jumping for joy at everything that I want to get done, I just act despite feeling very mild annoyance at having to do certain things - but then I also have in the back of my mind the knowledge that I'll feel a little thrill in pushing myself to do something I initially didn't care to do.    <br><br>Back when doing AF1, most of the time when I had a large block of time to work on my lists, I'd just go through the oldest pages and do everything on them - often in order of entry, maybe dismissing only one or two things per page that seemed like a waste of time.  That's why I had to pre-dismiss so much of the time, because I had to get my logical "you can't do it all / you shouldn't do it all" brain involved.  And that's why it seems like they're just things on a list to me unless there's limiting factors like if I'm tired after work, the stores aren't open or the weather isn't cooperating.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 April 2010 at 22:36 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh Jacqueline, what I would give to have even some of the resolve you describe here. Do it because it is on the list! What a concept...<br><br>We are all built differently, aren't we.<br><br><br>Speaking of factors to deter one such as the weather isn't cooperating...we've had 14" of snow in about so many hours. Where is Spring?? (I'm in far northern CA, btw).<br>But a great reason (i.e. excuse) to not walk the dog.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 April 2010 at 23:59 | Beth L</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Spring is over here south of Detroit!  25 degrees where it's usually 15. <br><br>I gleaned from Norman and Mark that following AF tasks should be done if they stand out. They should stand out only if they are worth doing now. Feeling like doing it might affect the stand-outiness but should never stop you from tackling something that presents itself for action. <br><br>I think that's what Norman was saying.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2010 at 2:05 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Beth, it took a few years of daily training with Worst First / Eat the Frog (getting up at 4 a.m. to workout and crazy stuff like that) to get to that point.  I think I'm getting soft though.<br><br>I agree with you Alan, but that was part of my problem - everything stood out as something I should do when I saw it all down on paper because I would eventually want to have done it, I just needed to be able to pace stuff out.  I always had to consciously dismiss to keep things under control in terms of volume and projects started or set myself an upper page limit so that I would put very little on after I hit around 5-10 pages.  When I didn't do that and just put everything on, I got in excess of 25 pages super quickly.  And I didn't even put fun stuff on my list at all or my work - that was just my home work list!    <br><br>That's why I think it's a good thing that there was a shift to not having everything on the list but only what you're going to work on over the next couple of weeks or month or so.  Lots of people experienced this list explosion - Mike, Mel, Christine B, Seraphim...<br><br>We're warmer up here in western Canada - double digit centigrade temps. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 April 2010 at 2:51 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re. transparency, I listened to an old Erhard MP3, and it made much more sense.  <br><br>"...probably in your best moments, you are probably unaware of yourself... When things are going well, you are transparent... You don't even notice yourself, you are transparent, all that is showing up is the work that you're doing... the activity that you're engaged in."  <br><br>"The highly regarded thing "myself", during your best moments, is not even there."<br><br>"When 'you' show up, is as soon as something isn't going well."<br><br>"When you show up, you show up like an assessment.  A kind of saying something about something.  "That's terrible... something went wrong..." "<br><br>"Consider that whenever YOU show up, and are not transparent, is as assessment."<br><br>"An alternative to the psychological assessment is philosophical assessment... It's very simple, to live being philosophical assessment is to live as your word... to live with commitment, to live AS commitment... It means to live with a commitment to completion... to wholeness... to communication... to authenticity... to integrity.  Do your assessment on the basis of commitment, completion, authenticity, integrity... The assessment is very automatic."  <br><br>In case anyone's interested, here's what I pulled the above from - and the best recordings I've ever heard.:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dynamicdiscord.com/BrianStuff/Werner/">http://www.dynamicdiscord.com/BrianStuff/Werner/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2010 at 1:13 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Linda Anderson Krech of the ToDo Institute has sent me an updated link:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.todoinstitute.org/purpose.html">http://www.todoinstitute.org/purpose.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 10:45 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
