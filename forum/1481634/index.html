I mention this because, in some of the commentary on SF I read that things I'd do anyway and calendared tasks and nondiscretionary tasks don't get written into SF. SF does not contain things we'd do anyway or things on the calendar (diary).<br><br>My goal is to write EVERYTHING down before I do it. I've been striving for this for about a week. I find this practice more significant than the particular rules for C2. Mark talks about writing things down in the DIT book. He mentioned something about writing creating a buffer between the impulse and action. <br><br>David Hume said that "reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions." And it is true that the emotions are what motivate people to do tasks. Reason alone is inert. Hume notwithstanding, I like that the writing buffer allows my passions to cool ever so slightly so that reason has a little more time to calculate a better course of action.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 22:23 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>moises,<br><br>I'm guilty of writing these types of things down, as well, but not consistently. There is a somewhat hypnotic feeling of satisfaction about being able to cross out a task. So, for example, today I wrote down "attend teleconference X at 11:00" and "attend telecon Y at 14:00" even though these were fixed appointments in my calendar that I was unlikely to forget, and obviously not discretionary time (which is what the list is for, afterall).<br><br>Of course, anything can be taken to extremes. I don't usually write bathroom or dressing or eating activities, for example.  So you might qualify what you mean by "EVERYTHING."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 22:37 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Moise you wrote "My goal is to write EVERYTHING down before I do it." <br><br>This is very interesting. I put everything to but which is only or may be actionable. Ie Things I decide to act very soon. If something is not actionable and is a task it usualy goes in Omnifocus, if something is a comment or a note about a projetct I am following it goes to my project file which is always a file like .page or .word or mostly now a .text because it is read by all text editor.<br><br>Like ubi I am very curious to know what kind of task or elements do you put in SF ?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 May 2011 at 8:36 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ubi and Jupiter,<br><br>Well, I tried to word my post carefully by using the words "try" and "strive" to write everything.<br><br>When the phone rings, I answer it. I do not first write "phone."<br><br>When Mary walks into my office I talk to her. I do not first write "Mary."<br><br>I only use SF during normal business hours. I work away from home. I only use SF at the office. So, dressing does not get included.<br><br>But I eat a few times a day at work. I will write "eat" before I do it. (Or, I try to. Sometimes I forget.)<br><br>Before I leave my office to go to the bathroom I write "WC".<br><br>I am finding that this is a wonderful discipline that I sorely need. <br><br>When I started with SF I rarely used C2. But I was taking microbreaks without documenting them on the list. Now, as I try to be more self-aware, if I break off from one activity, I log that change in my list. <br><br>What I have learned after one week is that this practice is forcing me to be more honest with myself. It forces me to step back and ask, "What am I doing?" That is a very simple question. Sometimes I realize the answer is that I am avoiding some other aversive task. Somtimes, I realize that and continue to avoid it. But I believe that my increased self-awareness is a good thing.<br><br>As I said, I've only been doing this for about a week. It's still a work in progress. I will let you know how it develops.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 May 2011 at 18:37 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>moises,<br><br>Thanks for the clarification. It sounds like you are using your SF notebook for a combination of task listing and journaling. It might be better to log your daily activity in a planner or page-a-day calendar book, to get a better sense of how you're really spending your time, since the SF notebook isn't really chronological. But that would require double-entry of all the SF tasks you do.<br><br>I'm going to the WC now, without entering it in my SF notebook!  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 May 2011 at 19:25 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>moises,<br><br>As far as I understand, you put things into SF which you would have done anyway, like eating or going to the WC. These are physical needs which I think should be managed subconsciously outside of SF.<br><br>As ubi said, you combine your SF list for both task management and journaling, the latter being treated as part of your tasks. So when you cross out these activities you get a false impression as if you have done something, giving yourself a mental reward for it. If I was doing the same, this approach would lead to procrastination as I would start to fulfill my life with easily achievable trivia instead of doing what i have actually decided to commit myself to.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2011 at 16:23 | Rufat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Now I see why Mark would tell people to try something before they judge its effectiveness.<br><br>Have you tried it for a day? Did it increase your procrastination? <br><br>Or did it increase your focus?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2011 at 22:09 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, that's right. One can theorize about what would happen if one did such and such, but again and again I've found out that the only way to find out what would really happen is by doing it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2011 at 23:21 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>moises,<br><br>I am not judging its effectiveness and I am glad if it works for you! I just don’t see it work for myself.<br><br>I don’t think the only way to learn something is doing it. One does not necessarily need to try jumping out of window to see what happens to him. Of course there is no risk of injury in case of putting one’s physical needs into SF list, but it is the very same idea of trusting your intuition while going through the list to see what stands out. If I cannot trust my intuition to react to my physical needs, I would neither trust it to pick a task which stands out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 May 2011 at 19:17 | Rufat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ubi, <br><br>&lt;It might be better to log your daily activity in a planner or page-a-day calendar book, to get a better sense of how you're really spending your time, since the SF notebook isn't really chronological. But that would require double-entry of all the SF tasks you do.&gt;<br><br>Good points. For me AF and Superfocus versions have not afforded me the sense of how I'm spending my time like DIT did. However DIT did not afford me the fluidity and creativity that AF1 did. <br><br>So I'm currently testing out a daily version of AF1, Daily Autofocus (DAF) whereby each day represents a closed list. There is also space for daily reference notes and appointments so a calendar and notebook are no longer needed. I currently use an extra large moleskine but I think an A4 (letter sized) notebook is going to work better for me next time.<br><br>In taking this approach I've noticed a greater opportunity for Planning, Doing &amp; Reviewing (Continuous Improvement Cycle).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 May 2011 at 21:24 | leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>leon,<br><br>Your DAF idea sounds intriguing. Perhaps you can start a new post (forum article) to describe the idea in more detail, after you've tested it out for a while.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 May 2011 at 21:36 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Rufat:<br><br>&lt;&lt; One does not necessarily need to try jumping out of window to see what happens to him. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, but if you had to jump out of windows as part of your job (maybe as a stuntman), you wouldn't just theorize about what would be the best way, would you? You'd try different methods out - and when you'd found the safest/best way, you'd remove the safely net!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 May 2011 at 12:22 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with you that if going to WC is a part of one's job or somehow interferes with it, you would try different methods. If answering emails as they arrive is a part of one's job, then there should be methodology to do that outside SuperFocus. I suppose the same concept applies to physical needs as they are inevitable part of our lives and the way we should act in these cases may be dictated by nature.<br><br>It could be that theorizing helps me self-justify my unwillingness to do something! On the other hand, it is not just a case of verbiage as there is a logic behind it which actually makes me think before I react.<br><br>I remember you wrote about decision vs. reaction. And applying SuperFocus rules to one's daily activities, including going to WC, may itself become reactive. I could be misunderstanding SuperFocus, but for me putting something into SF is a task itself and before doing so I must *decide* whether to write it down or not. I wanted to experiment today and actually wrote "WC" in my C2 just to see how it will work for me and I crossed it out in a minute. Then I did the same with drinking a glass of water. I repeated it all over again while going through my other tasks. After doing so for some time I skimmed through my C2 and could not resist a feeling that these activities just did not belong to my SF list! I felt as though I lost balance between discipline and common sense. Now where is this golden mean?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 May 2011 at 22:53 | Rufat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The DAF idea started me on a brainstorm last night.   I'm trying out some new ideas.   Very interesting stuff.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 May 2011 at 22:54 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>When I was coaching, I used a simple method with very impulsive people. I told them that they must write everything down before doing it. Interposing a higher level activity (writing) between impulse and action causes the brain to switch from reactive mode to rational mode. This is a significant difference because it actually involves using different parts of the physical brain.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2011 at 0:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
