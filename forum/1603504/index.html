There are 240 pages total, so I am approaching the end.  I just had a moment when I thought of whether I should write an item in this notebook or the next.  <br><br>A few days ago, I went shopping for the next notebook. <br><br>On another thread, it was said that the Free-Form Notebook was inspired by Gerry's one notebook idea.  It is true that I did see his website and read about it.  I also googled and found others who used a notebook.  Google "GTD moleskine hacks".  It does help to see photos of how others use their notebook. <br><br>As I remember, Gerry uses a legal pad.  I like a bound notebook, where the pages are bound together, and one can see two pages at once. <br><br>I like the idea of using a composition book.  They cost $1-4 dollars, cheap compared to a Moleskine.  They are bigger than the Moleskine though.  I like the Moleskine's dimensions, 5 X 8, you can hold it in your hand, very portable, certainly lighter than a computer.   But if Moleskine get too costly for me, i could go to a composition book. <br><br>I looked at other notebooks, but decided on getting another Moleskine ruled 5X8.  I got it on sale.  Still, it is expensive.  But the number of lines per page and the number of pages is about right.  <br>I like the thought of completing the notebook and starting afresh with a new one.  I look forward to the pressure of finishing up items and cleaning up the "mess" and starting the first page of new notebook with all blank pages.  I am going to try to hold off until next month to start the new notebook, and use any blank spaces. <br><br>I mostly flip through the notebook to find a page, like a card deck.  Often I can just find the page I want that way. <br><br>I considered getting a notebook with perforated pages that can be removed.  I might get one of those and use it some day.  With a bound notebook, although it is "free-form", there can be an order - chronological according to when the page was started.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2011 at 17:57 | markhedm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>a suggestion for continuation of threads, please include link back to previous<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1582112">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1582112</a><br><br>useful for those of us who are following on a somewhat current basis, and essential for those discovering this thread new months from now<br><br>(I've been exploring earlier threads)<br><br>and if possible, links to any items mentioned in post and I do realize links are not always known anymore, so methods to find are appreciated as well<br><br>for example, great that you have Google "GTD moleskine hacks"<br><br>but if possible, please add way to find "Gerry's one notebook idea" I've just been Googling for and searching in FORUM and not found<br><br>we almost need an index summary of all the great ideas, I know I wish I'd started one from when I joined in.<br><br>thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2011 at 19:57 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>markhedm,<br><br>Thanks for the mention.  Over the years I have used a few different tools.  I usually use either a simple spiral notebook or a legal pad because using the write in one place idea notes also go on it.  By using something that has removable pages I can remove, save and file notes if needed.  Additionally, these are usually cheaper tools than Moleskine type notebooks.  I also like the idea that pages get reduced over time which reduces the amount of clutter and pages to flip through compared to a hard bound book.  <br><br>matthewS, the link to my website is below, all of my articles and ebooks are there and are now free.  Mark has been kind enough to let me answer questions here if you have any.  <br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2011 at 21:31 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>thank you Gerry<br><br>@markhedm, as for your post, I don't have an answer for notebook, but I certainly am interested, must be some good alternatives to Moleskine. there are always various assorted notebooks on sale at local art and bookstores, or special handmade books or small scale imitators of Moleskin available from obscure outlets, but that is not what works. needs to be something consistent, for years. much as Moleskine or composition book.<br><br>I find this Field Notes addicting enough to stay on their eMailing list, but not yet addicting enough to buy any.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/">http://fieldnotesbrand.com/</a> <br><br>Same size as Pocket Moleskine 3.5 x 5.5 inches. Which is too small for me, but might be useful for some. So why do I follow email list? Is a small design company making a standard model AND all kind of fun limited editions.<br><br>also been researching the various notebooks that have moveable pages that attach to rings. there are at least 2 standards. And just noticed recently that Staples (USA office supply store) is selling their own brand. I'm curious if is yet a 3rd standard, or based on one of the existing 2.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2011 at 21:54 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been using Field Notes "graph paper" books happily for a while now, and am about to start my second FreeFormFocus (FFF) notebook. The first one lasted about four weeks, with 14 of the 48 pages ending up as AF1 lists. When my current supply runs out, I might try switching to the pocket Moleskine "square" notebooks, for several reasons: (1) they have 64 pages; (2) the last few pages have perforations to facilitate tear-out notes; (3) there is a pocket on the back cover for loose papers; (4) they are stitched instead of stapled; and (5) the price is about the same for a pack of three notebooks. The only advantages to the Field Notes brand is that they are 100% American made (Moleskine now manufactures in China), and the shipping is free if you order enough –&nbsp;not sure about shipping cost for Moleskine.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2011 at 23:29 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; also been researching the various notebooks that have moveable pages that attach to rings&gt;&gt;<br><br>matthewS, I periodically get excited about these and almost buy them. The latest time was when Alan Baljeu reminded me of them, because they would have been perfect for his moveable project page system, and Seraphim's ... but whenever I try them out at the store, they feel terrible: cumbersome to detach and reattach, and relatively flimsy when I imagine moving them about with each actioned task. All things considered, the technology is not bad, for what they have achieved. But it isn't enough to tip the bar for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2011 at 5:49 | Bernie</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
