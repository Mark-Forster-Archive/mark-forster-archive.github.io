"<br><br>I'm having some difficulty remembering. But I think there were several reasons.

The opposite was my experience. FVP was becoming a headache for me because I keep on finding that the "chain" keeps on getting obsolete: the items that I mark just a few hours before (or worse, those that I mark a day before) don't necessarily mean those are the tasks I want to do now.<br><br>On the other hand, SFv3's rules are simple for me to understand. Before I cross out a task that I want to re-write, I ask myself: Do I want to resume this later today? If the answer is yes, it gets rewritten to the next page's Column 2; if not, it gets written to the last page's Column 1. <br><br>I think it's FVP's influence on me, the idea of doing what we want to do, that helped me in this regard. <br><br>On the other hand, having experience with "No List" systems I think helped me with achieving an AF1 like flow of work. It seems the "no list" system I was using before conditioned me to focus only on a few hard tasks at a time, to the point that I never have had more than two items total in my Column 2, with one of them usually the hard task I am focusing to finish and the other task some other urgent task that would interfere me. <br><br>-----<br><br>Mark: &lt;&lt;A finished task is either 1) a task which has no more current work left in it, e.g. you have emptied your email inbox, or 2) a task in which you have achieved your target for the day, e.g. read one chapter of "War and Peace".&gt;&gt;<br><br>Ah, I see the difference then. As I mentioned to Alan, my definition of "unfinished" has been heavily influenced by FVP, and thus I do not think of a specific daily target for a task. I just define what makes a task "finished" but I do not try to define how much should I do of it in a day. So far it has been working well. <br><br>&lt;&lt;1) The two-oolumn system wasn't able to cope with with the huge lists that some people (no names!) built up.&gt;&gt;<br><br>No problem with that yet!<br><br>&lt;&lt;2) I found resistance building up to always having to clear column 2&gt;&gt;<br><br>Well since I have redefined what an "unfinished" task is I don't have any problem with that yet.<br><br>&lt;&lt;3) It was slow-moving once the list had got beyond a certain size (which it invariably did).&gt;&gt;<br><br>I hope my trend of not abusing Column 2 and sticking to the dismissal process strictly will help with that.<br><br>&lt;&lt;4) I was getting an idea for a better system (which became FV)&gt;&gt;<br><br>Oh I don't know about that :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2016 at 21:20 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The UTMS, something between SuperFocus and FinalVersion worked perfectly fine for me.

While working in 5T mode, I often capture new things on a "side list" -- which I have been treating as a dynamic list -- till I have worked my 5T down to two items and am ready for more.  It's been very ad-hoc -- I don't have any "system" for feeding the 5T list from this side list -- which has been fine.   I just scan the side list sometimes, and if I have room on my 5T list, I add 1-2 things.   This has been fine -- but sometimes I feel a little scattered.<br><br>So maybe I can just do "5T + UTMS" which would basically be "UTMS but throw away everything at the end of the day".  :-)     Hm, sounds kinda fun, and easy to try.

The letter you received says what changed and who is affected (often cosmetic or to give more freedom). The reason you got the letter, is, as stated in the letter, so you are aware of the change. If it's a new procedure, the first paragraph explained what the procedure covered (and often what it did not, and links to intersecting procedures). The second section had, by person, a short (100 word) summary of what they did. And, I already consulted you, many times, before making the change!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2016 at 23:05 | Cricket</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
