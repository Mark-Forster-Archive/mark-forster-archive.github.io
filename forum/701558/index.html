I re-read some of Mark's very good advice to Mel in an earlier post where he told her that with the amount of discretionary time she had, she had too many active pages.  I have the same issue as I found that my list was getting overwhelmed by housecleaning items.  I do want a reasonably clean house, but it's not what I want written on my headstone ie. "she had a clean house".<br><br>I was experiencing resistance to dismissing those items, but in reality many of them could have been dismissed and weren't really very necessary.  I was definitely operating in *push* mode on them, seeing them as some sort of personal challenge that I wanted to overcome.  So this morning, I went through, weeded out 95% of them and pulled the others onto one little list that I will do today in about 4 hours (vs. the 17 hours and 10 days I thought they would take pre-dismissing.  I'm only moving them onto one list because some are time-dependent (have to wait until stores open).  <br><br>As I was going through dismissing however, I realized that a large number of the tasks I was dismissing were specific cleaning items (eg. clean out microwave).  Now my microwave isn't that dirty, but my kitchen floor is as I just had the plumber in to install my new dishwasher.  So I had a realization that instead of breaking down these housecleaning type of tasks like I had been doing, I should be making this item MORE general.  So instead of having 15 items on the list relating to cleaning the kitchen, I can have only 1 - "clean kitchen" - whatever is needing to be cleaned the most can then be attended to vs. having "clean kitchen table" come up on the list when in fact, the counters are messier than the table.  Then I can use common sense and do the one that's most pressing.  I don't need a project plan for this as I have very clear visual evidence of the problem.  :-)<br><br>Doing this will also have the benefit of cutting the length of my list by 50%, keep my focus on doing basic maintenance towards a clean house and free up my time and my list for more important things.  <br><br>I'm not sure how far to go with this - do I break it down by room - or just write "clean house" on the list?  Or is that too far?<br><br>I already do this with my decluttering project and that's going well.  All I have written on the list is "declutter" - which to me means getting at least one box and preferably my whole car trunk full of stuff to give away - or listing a big item on freecycle.  <br><br>I'm going to consider doing something similar with my home reno as well and move the individual items off to a separate project list because I'm not as sure of some of the steps as I am with something basic like housecleaning.  If I have less pages, it will surely come up on the weekends like it ought to.  <br><br>Has anyone else tried reducing their granularity/chunking down to achieve less pages ?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2009 at 13:18 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>BTW, doing this will bring me down to 9 active pages from 17.  I think I need to steal "learning as I go" 's moniker.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2009 at 13:53 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I did exactly this - but only after trying every other combination - here's my "clean kitchen" journey .......<br><br>Stage 1 - Individual Items<br>Several individual items found their way onto my list as part of the organic process.  Levels of resistance and speed of action on those items made me aware of certain "feelings" related to specific task (e.g. my dishwasher story).<br><br>Stage 2 - The Quest for Balance!<br>I assumed that my new revelations would cause my kitchen to be instantly transformed - well actually that I would "just do" the relevant items :-)  That didn't happen to the extent hoped for with the result that "clear kitchen" became a necessary task, leading to ....<br><br>Stage 3 - The Dumping (Panic) Stage<br>In an attempt to force the "clear/clean kitchen" tasks to jump out I dumped every single related task I could think of into AF, all in one go, and waited to reach that page .......<br><br>Stage 4 - Action - "Not Fun"<br>When I reached the page I ignored the resistance and "just did it".  It was not fun.  It was not AF, and I most certainly would not recommend doing it again!<br><br>Stage 5 - Rethink<br>It is obvious when you think about it, that any "project" to clear or clean a room can be treated as a recurring task, regardless of whether some of the individual tasks are periodic (eg defrost freezer) or daily (dishwasher).  I therefore created a quite pretty MindMap, with all of the tasks associated with the kitchen, complete with little pictures and colour (using MindManager).  Any time I need my kitchen to be addressed I can just print off my MindMap - which looks fun - and do whatever tasks are necessary.  In actual fact, since creating the MindMap I haven't had any problem with the kitchen - it is staying clear, and everything is just being done as I go along.  It's as though creating the MindMap put the original AF fun back into things!  <br><br>I now have tasks to create similar MindMaps for the other rooms but have already found that they are starting to clear with just the addition of the few organic tasks at present ......<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2009 at 15:09 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline,<br><br>I am all over the map on this.  It comes down to how the tasks strike you.  In general, I favor going to a higher level.  When it comes to house cleaning, I do it by room.  I know that when I walk into the kitchen I can see what has to be done ... or know it anyway.  Also, how much planning do I need to do for something like that.<br><br>With renovations, however, I might go down to a lower level ... depending.  There are things that do take some planning ... rent a machine, buy supplies, get help, etc.<br><br>It just all depends.  I would recommend having a project list for renovations where you think it all out down to the lowest level that makes sense then pull of a few of the first things and put them on the AF list.  That way you'll get to think it through but not have all that depressing clutter in front of your eyes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2009 at 17:08 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Like Mike, I vary on these things... depending on the task, specificity OR generality can lead to resistance and the annoying part is I CAN'T PREDICT which it will be!  So I write it down as it strikes me and then rethink/rephrase depending on how I respond to the item.  One thing that ALWAYS gets written down as general is laundry, which is on my personal list at least once (and more often twice) per page. This keeps me from starting a load and then forgetting about it for 2 days, which I have been known to do.  :^)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2009 at 17:52 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I hear you Sarah, I had to put in a task to put the clean clothes away.  Years ago, when they had good stuff on TV (your opinion may vary from what I considered good at the time :-).  I had my Thursday "LA Law, Falcon Crest, and maybe Dynasty" - can't remember, but some '80's show.  That was my do laundry in commercials night and it worked really well.  Plus I lived in an apartment, so didn't have the option of just leaving my laundry.  Now I don't have that kind of night anymore since I don't watch TV unless it's a DVD I've bought.  It's amazing what you can accomplish in commercial time - and I think the commercials have become even longer, so one could probably get a lot done in those breaks... too bad there's nothing I like on...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2009 at 19:15 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Christine, <br><br>I really don't want to spend any time planning something that is so fundamentally basic.  I just want to come to "clean kitchen" on the list - look around me, see what's messy and do it.  You sound like a phenomenal planner - much better than I am, for sure.  But I've spent so many years planning and planning and not doing a damn thing on the plan, that I find myself anti-planning now.  Somewhere there's a middle ground and that's AF for me now.  <br><br>What I am going to work on however is looking at the *source* of the problems and how I can work with those to reduce the time I need to spend or make it more enjoyable for me.  My new dishwasher was just installed as well as 2 new toilets (dismissed that item to clean the toilets by buying new ones ) :-) and I'm shopping for a self-cleaning oven as well.  <br><br>As far as the source goes, a major cause of the messes is the dog.  Because we don't put things away right away, he drags them around willy nilly.  This creates three times the work for me because something wasn't put behind closed doors immediately.  <br><br>I've also found that because this house is so big, it's actually harder for me to designate set places where things should go and I'm working on that.  In the RV, I have very limited cabinets and storage, so I am forced to be organized.  I am not a messy person at work however, but that's because I clean my desk every night before going home.  That's a 10 minute habit that I should be adopting at home as well every night before bed.  So it shouldn't really become a task so much as a routine.<br><br>When I was super neat before when selling my last home, it was because I had to prepare for the fact that someone could be coming by at any time and I'd have no more than 5 minutes to pick up and shine things.  I don't want to be at that stage necessarily, but my written goal this year was to be at a state - in a year's time - where it took only 15 minutes to clean the house at any time in preparation for visitors.  I'll get there, but I can see it taking me the whole year. :-)<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2009 at 19:54 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I used to be able to have everything ready for folks coming rounds in about 15 minutes but so many things happened over the past few years that CHAOS has definitely taken over.  But it is improving!!!! :-)<br><br>I used to plan and probably overplan but the past few years all of the plans went to pot -  whatever I did plan I lost the list/plan or whatever.  What I am now doing is actually creating and partially recreating my old system that worked amazingly well for me and ensuring not just that I have plans, but that I know where they are, and where everything else is.  A list of what needs doing in the kitchen is really not necessary, but it serves two purposes - (1) if I need to do a major clean in a short period of time I have a checklist (and I work much better with checklists, particularly when I am stressed) and (2) it looks pretty and playing with Mindmaps satisfies my creativity!  It's a lot more fun to clean a kitchen with a pretty checklist .... now is that sad or what?  :-)  <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2009 at 20:37 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine, that reminds me of the flylady control journal method.  I just couldn't get into using it, although I did up a very nice binder with all the routines in it.  <br><br>I think I just need a very simple philosophy like learning as I go's "leave no footprint" - and that's put things away - it takes as much energy to hang up a coat as it does to put it over the back of a chair.  Dishes don't go in the sink, they go straight into the dishwasher - which by necessity then always has to be cleaned out regularly.  Tools go back in the bin or the toolbox when we're done using them - all simple stuff but hard to do for me anyway.<br><br>But I grew up in a family of 8 in a 1300 s.f. house on a farm and my mother was always on top of this stuff.  Everything had a place and everything was put in it's place every day.  It had to be or it would have been complete chaos.  I don't recall her ever planning anything.  But she had extremely well-established routines for different times of the day - but then she wasn't distractable like I am and people didn't buy a lot of *stuff* back then.  And I supect her life wasn't as *interesting* either.  :-)<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2009 at 17:04 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I think the thing about organisation is that there is no "one size fits all".  At the end of the day we need to find something that works for us - and however much we tell ourselves it's that we have "too much stuff", "insufficient storage" "not enough time" or any one of the 101 excuses we have made to ourselves over the years, the fact is that we are who we are and we do what we do.  Yes we can change our actions but that does not deal with whatever is "causing" the situation in the first place.<br><br>I read somewhere about someone saying that within a short space of time even a hotel room would be messy - that is exactly what I find - I can't blame that on anything other than my own choices.  Yes I can tidy it up pretty quickly, but the fact that it happens is an indication that what would be "normal" for most people just doesn't work for me.<br><br>I think one thing AF has shown me very clearly is that I somehow need a middle stage.  My dishwasher has proved really useful at guidance on this point - for me that is to create a sort of middle ground.  If I try to force myself to put every dish straight into the dishwasher I will resent it.  But I quite happily take my dirty dishes into the kitchen and put them on the side next to the dishwasher.  Next time I am making a coffee, or just when I am next in the kitchen they inevitably get put into the dishwasher - absolutely no stress - but for whatever reason I "need" that mid point.  Similarly I have the same problem with putting my coat away - so the "new" place is a chair in the lounge.  Again periodically when I am in the lounge I will just take my coat and put it away.  Why am I like that?  I have no idea - probably a childhood resentment at being told when to do something when I wanted to be doing something else - but at the end of the day I do not want a system that is going to tell me what to do and when to do it.  My mid way staging points seem to eliminate those feelings .... :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 March 2009 at 13:25 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine, I wonder if you've read the post where Mel was talking about "The House That Cleans Itself"?   I haven't read it, but it makes sense to me.  Basically working with the way you are rather than trying to conform to someone else's way of doing things.<br>For people that would rebel against hanging up their coats the "proper" way, there's coat trees.  I installed a hanging garment rack in my downstairs laundry room because I'm too lazy to drag the clothes upstairs and hang them up.  So I get dressed for work in the morning in my laundry room.   I'm making it a priority this year to be more inventive about finding ways to work with the way that I naturally am but also try to gently introduce new routines into my life where I won't feel them.  I've started armor-alling my car while I'm commuting and stopped at red lights.  It probably looks weird, but who cares?<br><br>Personally, I'm so happy to have my new dishwasher installed after about a year of living without one that I'm happily filling it at every opportunity - I'm sure the novelty will wear off.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2009 at 1:40 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Hadn't seen that post (was that on the Forum?) but looked up the book on Amazon - it is exactly the technique I use to "manage" my house!

I go through each room and tidy things away, wipe surfaces, check the laundry basket, etc.  It is quick, easy and I do want is necessary in each room.  There is no need to intellectualise housework.

Like Caroline, I'll just do it.<br><br>But when there's something that will require more time, or when there's a small thing that keeps getting missed, that's when I'll put it on the list.<br><br>With reference to granularity, I decide that on the fly. Because I run electronically, I can add sub-tasks as and when. I'd normally just write clean kitchen; if stuff's not getting done or there's something bigger to do, I'll add those as sub-tasks. I'll certainly not keep clean kitchen on the list indefinitely. When it's done, it's done. Hopefully I (we) stay on top of it. If not, and it builds up I'll add it again. (Have to admit I'm just using this as an example - clean kitchen has never appeared on my list so far, just done it as I've gone along.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2009 at 11:31 | Dm</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's the thing though Caroline and Dm - you DO just do it, I don't.  :-)  I don't naturally stay on top of it, I never have (even when I worked only part-time for a short period) except for when selling a house.  I avoid it because I don't like doing it.  My aversion is getting less now that I have it on my list and it's not such an overwhelming job anymore - and not just because it's tidier, being on the list takes away my resistance somehow, because I can just put a few minutes into something I suppose.   I need something to give me a little push to do it, other people don't and I envy them.  <br><br>You have three occasions to go through your house every day, I work on average 13 or more hours a day away from home and children and animals are messing things up while I'm gone.   If you're the kind of person who if you had my life, would come home and start cleaning things up immediately, you have a habit and a routine and I think we all agree we don't need AF for things that are routine.  Prior to AF, my routine would be to come home and start reading a book because I didn't want to work for another hour.  By having this stuff on a list and just giving myself a little push to work for half an hour or so, things are getting done on a regular basis.   The only downside is I don't read as much anymore... :-)<br><br>In contrast, my work has never really "built up" very much - because I stay on top of things.  That's why I waited so long to even implement AF at work, because I didn't really need it there.  I don't write "clear email" on the list because my inbox (usually) is always empty, I have both a habit and routine established for that.   I feel a bit confused with people on the forum who seem to overthink their work, because I usually tend to "just do it" like you do with housework.   But I understand where they're coming from, just glad I'm not there - well, excluding this week anyway.  :-)<br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2009 at 13:38 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One of the reasons you don't do it is probably because you're shattered from your 13 hour days. <br><br> Why don't you just pay someone to come in a couple of times a week to clean?  It's much nicer to live in a clean and tidy home.  It won't cost that much and it will create a better energy which in turn will make you feel better and more motivated to get on with 'other stuff'.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2009 at 18:22 | Caroline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's quite interesting reading the above posts and looking back at how I "have" been highly organised and at other times highly unorganised.  I used to work away from home to the extent that I was never truly sure whether my home existed during daylight hours during the week, and then I'd be travelling in the US for up to 5 weeks at a time.  I was probably most organised then - I had a PA to deal with my mail (my biggest hate!) and my parents used to keep an eye on my home while I was away.  I still had a fair amount of clutter but was generally pretty organised.<br><br>The last few years have been a different story - no problem helping others be organised but life has been turned on it's head and like Jacqueline I had an aversion to the routines.  They got done because they had to but I certainly could have turned avoidance into an art form......:-)<br><br>It's strange how AF has not just enabled things to be done, but enables them to be done and then become the routines that they used to be.  My kitchen now does just "clean itself" but if I have friends rounds and need more of a clean up afterwards then I can just add any specific tasks to the list. <br><br>That's why I decided to dump some of my backlogs into the system and the ease with which they are being cleared is amazing.  I can't say that there is no resistance but the issue is more boredom than resistance in most cases, and that can be alleviated by task switching.  I know my pages and item numbers have increased drastically over a few days but the progress is well worth it and once this and my last two remaining backlog areas are addressed then there'll be no stopping me!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2009 at 18:28 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I can understand your thinking Caroline - that I should just pay someone else to do it, and I've even told myself that at times as well.  I think it's one of those things that I really want to conquer in myself.  A lot of what I do when I am cleaning is go through things to find things to give away.  A cleaner can't do that for me.  And with AF it is getting done, the clutter is going away, trunk load by trunk load.  The long days will end when my consulting contract is over in the next month or so, and until then I'm happy with just keeping the basics done every day.  <br><br>My sister used to hire a cleaner, then go clean prior to their coming so they would be able to get the house completely done in an afternoon a couple of times a month.  <br><br>If I wasn't trying to save as much money as possible prior to retiring at the end of this year, I probably would go the cleaner route.  I'd rather have a bit more mess and more cash in the bank though.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2009 at 19:38 | Jacqueline</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
