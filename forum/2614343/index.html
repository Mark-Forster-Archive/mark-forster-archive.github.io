It still is a "catch-all" like list, where you can list all what you plan to do, that functions like a "no-list" in that it automatically trims the list to a manageable size and the list is renewed every day.<br><br>1. Write a short list of the tasks you are SURE to do today.  Close it with a line across at the bottom.<br>2. You can write new tasks below this line anytime, and you can do any of the tasks you write either above or below the line. <br>3. Once all the tasks above the drawn line are done, close the list again with a line across at the bottom of the list, but this time cross out all items you are NOT SURE you will do today; if needed rewrite such crossed out tasks below the line.<br>4. Go back to step 2.<br><br>As you can see I have taken inspiration from AF4.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 June 2016 at 9:57 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym:<br><br>Am I right in thinking that the only tasks left undone at the end of the day should be below the last drawn line? It sounds good.

The only a few  differences are that <br><br>1. I keep to having a current initiative<br>2.I make a weekly DIT list (and from that I make sub-lists exactly as you explain here) <br>3.I bundle my routine work into fake deadlines.  example: fake deadline for Finances is Friday.<br>During the week I can chip away at it so that Friday's Finances are already partially done.  If I have plans for any of the days, I simply make sure that it's done ahead of time.<br>4.For the lion's share of routine stuff, I simply have lifelong habits that take are of it automatically.  Mike Brown's thread: mis-en-place pretty much describes it as does Mark's discussions about routines if you haven't already created your life maintenance and responsibilities routines.  After awhile, you'll find yourself doing them even if you're sick, injured or inebriated.

It's so routinized into my brain that I'm actually looking forward to returning to it once I'm physically able to. <br><br>This system has served be brilliantly through whatever challenges life seems to throw at me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 June 2016 at 15:18 | Learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Learning:<br><br>That's an amazing testimony!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 June 2016 at 15:44 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark<br>Yes, I agree!

I divide the page into 2 columns. The left side is what I work from and it is No-List FVP. In the right column I use what I'll call nuntym's Sure-to-do system as a side list (for capturing below the line) and as a feeder (items from above or below the line) particularly when I have everything crossed off the left column and I need a reminder of something I was planning on doing today (but I didn't necessarily think of early in the day). When it's time to close off the sure-to-do open list, I put checkboxes next to the things I'm sure to do today and leave them on the list, and I transfer the remaining items and email them to myself in an ever growing list which I have not used for anything yet, because the first time I used the system on the right column I ended up with 2 pages of tasks that I was obviously not even going to touch that day. I guess I have a thought that maybe at some point I can organize that list and come up with a plan to do a bunch of useful stuff. Or maybe it will just sit there doing nothing, but for now I like this dual system which allows freedom, keeps me on track, lets me note down things that need to be done but I can't do it right now, lets me break down big tasks into smaller tasks, allow for interruptions on top of interruptions of top of meetings on top of to-do items without losing my place, and finishes the day with everything crossed out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2016 at 4:00 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(Third attempt trying to post this comment.)<br>Wow my writing is terrible. Anyway...<br><br>nuntym, how do you keep the list below the line short? You said write new tasks below the line anytime. Do you try to limit it to items that you think you will actually do today at the time you write it? Otherwise it seems like you would have to do too many things to rewrite which is the problem I ran into on the very first list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2016 at 4:08 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been sort of dabbling with this in the intervals of using No-List FVP.
