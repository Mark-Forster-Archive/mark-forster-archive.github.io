It can be paper notebook or electronic.  Like FV, the pages don't matter.<br><br>Cycle the entire list in order, doing anything that "stands out."  When you reach the top of the list, you *must* do the first task.  If you *cannot* do it now (e.g., it's "clean bathroom" and you're at work), then you can rewrite it at the end and cross it out, but then you must do the new top task (or, rarely, repeat the above exception).<br><br>The key here is that the standing out is influenced by your desire to avoid the top task on the list, which you are likely to be resisting.  This means that some things you are resisting - but resisting less - will "stand out" even though they otherwise wouldn't.<br><br>Here are some key advantages:<br><br>1. Pressure is put on the top of the list, just like FV.<br><br>2. It has many of the advantages of FV, but removes the main disadvantage of FV - having more than one task selected at a time.<br><br>3. It's very simple and has very low overhead.<br><br>4. It uses structured procrastination and little-and-often in a very simple, natural way that is akin to Mark's systems.<br><br>5. It can respond pretty much immediately to urgent items, just like FV.<br><br>6. If you let the "standing out" happen "nearly randomly," it has a lot of the same advantages of the random system, except an out-of-context task is never selected, and there is just enough element of "psychological readiness" to make it less resistive.<br><br>Anyone want to join me in trying it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2014 at 18:23 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Note that the system responds to how effective your "standing out" mechanism is.  If you are prone to picking only quick and easy things - or practically nothing - then you are often forced to do the first task, which you have likely been resisting.  On the other hand, if you have a strong "choice muscle" and your standing out mechanism picks a variety of things, then you aren't as often forced to do the first task.  So it is somewhat self-correcting, and it may tend to train your choice muscle.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2014 at 18:50 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It sounds like something like this could work, but Randomizer is just so much fun!   :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 February 2014 at 16:06 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That was my concern as well - that this system has a lot of potential, but it will be hard for it to attract testers on the heels of the randomized system.  Anyway, I will be testing it and will let y'all know how it turns out.  I really think it has a lot of potential.  Ever since FV came out, I've wanted a simple way to achieve the power of the features of FV with only one task selected at a time.

I have also been thinking about ways to use some of FVs advantages in a simpler way.  I have a schedule spreadsheet where 'things I need to do work' are in a separate column.  This method allows me to just scan that column.  Since I read your post, I have been trying this.

It works well-enough when I'm not over-confident. When I'm over-confident and have to work on the first task, and that task is low-priority (possibly a "write it down now, decide importance later" type task), I don't have the discipline to defer it. Most other systems fail then, too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2014 at 16:26 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Austin,<br><br>Still working great for me!<br>Question for clarification please:  Do you "restart" everyday?  ie: begin each day by looking down the list for something to stand out, then when back to the top "do first item".

So, one may complete several tasks before reaching the first task?  <br><br>Two, once you reach and work on the very first task, then would you move down the list and work on what "stands out?" Would one normally cycle to the end of the list before moving back to the top? <br><br>I really like the idea of this simple system.

Feel free to try it and let us know how it works, though. <br><br>Thanks everyone for the helpful feedback.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2014 at 13:22 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>On a mundane level -- I use Readability to send web pages to my Kindle. I often have 10+ "pages" of backlogged reading.<br><br>So I simply go to the last page and instead of scanning what 'stands out' (because page titles are sometimes corrupted or don't adequately describe the article), I just start reading the first article on that page. <br><br>I can usually tell in a screen or two whether it's something I want to continue reading. <br><br>After filing or deleting that article, I then go to the next-to-last page, select the first article on that screen, and start reading. And so on, decrementing to page 1.<br><br>I like the novelty of not quite knowing what I'll be reading next, and this gives me some structure to navigate this pile of unread pages.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2014 at 15:27 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cricket,<br><br>It comes with just about all of Mark Forster-style systems (although I created this system, it is entirely based on his ideas and methods, at least as I have understood them) that you work on a task for as long as you feel like working on it.  You don't need "discipline" to decide that first task needn't (or shouldn't) be worked on for very long.  You can just realize that it only needs brief treatment and move on.  You know what is urgent and what isn't.  Besides, by the time you are forced to do a task, you have always had opportunity to scan the entire list and work on whatever stands out as ready to be done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2014 at 19:24 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very interesting results so far.  I am pleasantly surprised at how effective the self-balancing effect is.  When my standing-out mechanism is prone to selecting quick and easy things and passing over things that require more sustained effort (which are also generally more important), I am often required to do something I have been putting off.  This tends to strengthen my standing-out mechanism such that I choose things that in other systems I put off.  I have been impressed at how well this works.  Today I have done a number of important things that in any other system I would have delayed much longer.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2014 at 21:57 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been trying this out for the last 24 hours and am pleasantly surprised by how well it's working so far. Of course you can't really tell a lot at this stage, but I'm certainly going to keep going for the time being.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2014 at 18:52 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I missed the "scan the entire list" step.<br><br>If not discipline, then what skill or strength keeps me working on the right things, especially when the system says, "You have to work on this fun and inspiring project that you've been putting off for more important things."<br><br>Things tend not to stand out for me in the middle time range. They stand out when I'm excited about them, or the deadline looms.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2014 at 19:07 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like the idea of this simplification to FV. If I ever decide to give up on SMEMA, I will try this approach. BTW, it needs a name and/or initialism.  'SNS' isn't very descriptive (but neither is 'FV' for that matter).<br><br>One question, which also pertains to some of Mark's other systems: Regarding an out-of-context top (forced) selection, Austin writes that one may "rewrite it at the end and cross it out." Why is this better than sliding down the list to the first in-context item, and leaving the top item(s) in place?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2014 at 19:15 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ubi,<br>I have been doing the 'slide' if the first item is out of context.  If I don't, my super power of finding reasons that something is not currently doable kicks in.  Doing the slide keeps the first item in a position that forces me to deal with it on a regular basis.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2014 at 19:57 | Mark Thomas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Y'all may be right, but I've always appreciated the shrinking effect and the feeling of constantly moving forward that comes from always deleting the first task whether you've done it or postponed it.<br><br>Regarding a name, I've been brainstorming it for days and haven't settled on something.  One that came to mind was "auto-balance" because of the self-balancing effect, but I don't want to use that name unless it conclusively turns out to be as good as it initially appears to be, and even then I'm not sure if I like it or not.  Suggestions welcome.<br><br>Mark, I'm glad you are finding it useful.  I would be very interested in your continued feedback, ultimate conclusions, etc.<br><br>Cricket,<br><br>A few things come to mind.  1.) You'll have this problem in any system, 2.) The force mechanism naturally tends to balance hard work and easy work as described above, and 3.) How did something really fun and enjoyable that you want to procrastinate with get to the oldest task on the list in the first place?  The only way this happens is if you have a lot of self-discipline to do the important things, in which case, consider it a reward.  Otherwise those tasks will stay at the end of the list because you are picking them often.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2014 at 21:49 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Austin wrote: "Y'all may be right, but I've always appreciated the shrinking effect and the feeling of constantly moving forward that comes from always deleting the first task whether you've done it or postponed it."<br><br>I agree with Austin on this one.

This would have given the system more of a DIT feel, but I ended up concluding that it probably would do more harm than good to have a second force point.  I may try it eventually, but first I want to give the existing system a fair and thorough trial.  I suspect "the Oyster system," as interesting as its name is, may never come to fruition.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2014 at 23:15 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Update. I have been working the system for two days and, by the numbers, it is going really well. I've tried many of the systems here and the tweaks Austin made really fit my way of working. The amount of work I gotten done in the past two days has eclipsed the amount of work of work I have accomplished at the "start" of other systems-which is always higher for me because of the initial enthusiasm. <br><br>Note: Reentering works better than sliding for me. <br><br>I think it is interesting that out of all the systems of time management I have tried, Mr. Forster's various system and this website have been the most productive for me and lasted longer than any other I have purchased or read about in the past two decades. So much so that whenever I advise colleagues and others, I always point them first to one of Mark's (free) systems, his books, and the knowledge found in these forums. In some ways, this whole enterprise, for me, is a splendid example of open source knowledge and procedures and a positive community to sharpen one's own abilities in this particular sphere of interest.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 February 2014 at 0:43 | Pastor Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Austin, you're right, those problems happen in any system that picks a task for you. Garbage In (poorly-prioritized list) = Garabage Out. Some, systems though, feel like they'll do it sooner than others.<br><br>You're right, it's discipline that keeps those fun projects from taking too much time. I moved a bunch to hibernation quite a while ago. It's easier to avoid them now that I'm not on a roll with them.

My initial impressions are that it is simple and effective to implement. It has helped me clear a nasty number of backlog items over this period. I like the simplicity of the method. There are basically very few rules to have to remember and I think this really helps one to work the system. <br><br>It seems like it is easy to spot the items of resistance and it appears to be particularly useful for dealing with different contexts in a logical way.

I think you and others are right that the list should be kept short.  This is also true of the Final Version, as opposed to, say, AF1.  AF1 was intended to let you throw everything that comes into your mind at it and let it "focus" the work and filter out the other stuff; helping you make decisions subconsciously.  FV, on the other hand, instructs you to list only things you actually intend to take action on sometime soon.  I think that is also necessarily in this new system.
