For that reason, it's quite uninhabitable and I have had to rent another place further along the street.<br><br>All this meant that a couple of weekends ago I had to move, for the first time in 25 years.  I put much of my stuff in an unused room in the basement of my company's office. My heart sank as I did it, as I realised that I was placing into storage literally tons of books, papers and other things that I know I will never allow back into the home when it is ready for reoccupation.  <br><br>In hindsight, I should have culled much of it before moving.  But deep down I had known that the house was cluttered for years before, and yet I rarely did much about it.  It's really illuminating how little I bought to the temporarily rented house.<br><br>I've spent much time wondering why I clung on to this stuff, because I see a strong parallel between reluctance to let go of possessions and reluctance to dismiss tasks from the AF list.<br><br>The point that has come to me most strongly is that the reason for keeping stuff is emotional.  Various items for which I have no continuing use, and in some cases never had any use, are hard to discard because they were given to me by relatives or friends.  <br><br>Other items I can't bear to shift because they cost what was to me a lot at the time.  Anyone want a Minox camera from the 1980s?  Beautifully made and tiny, and several hundred pounds even then, but outperformed by even a modest digital camera at a quarter of the price in inflation-adjusted money.  I would not have dreamed of throwing it away soon after I bought it, but years later it is of no value to anyone.<br><br>I suspect that the tendency to cling on to things because one has cash or emotion invested in them varies from person to person, but that an individual's tendency in this respect won't change much over a life time.  I doubt one can be trained to be ruthless at culling things.<br><br>If this is true, AF lists are doomed to increase in the hands of at least some people.  They just won't dismiss ruthlessly enough.<br><br>Some I suppose would argue that what's on their list isn't clutter.  It's real work, given to them by their boss, or a customer.  But the sense that you actually have to respond to these demands is, deep down, an emotional one; if you don't do it, the boss will be angry or the customer will go elsewhere. On a list that is overwhelmingly long, many things on it aren't going to get completed, and those items amount to clutter whatever their origin or good intentions.<br><br>I've been wondering about techniques for getting over this problem.  One comes from Don Aslett, an American who runs a cleaning business and whose books I like very much.  He suggests maintaining an emotional withdrawal box, in which you place things that you find hard to let go.  You are free to take them back out of the box at any time, but anything that is still in the box after a year goes to the charity shop or the dump. <br><br>Perhaps in AF4, the closed list could serve as an emotional withdrawal list, and seen not as containing items that, for the most part, will be done, but for a few dismissals, but as a list of items that will not be done, except to the extent that you salvage a handful.  <br><br>Another idea is simply to do the equivalent of moving house.  Every month, start a new list.  You can consult the old list if you want, to make sure that truly important things don't get forgotten, but, again, the bias is that those things will not be done and the old list is largely discarded.<br><br>I've thought also of trying to limit the size of the list to say 200 tasks.  After that, you have to chop it down through dismissal if you want to add any more.  This is an analogue of something I've found helpful, which is to have a 30cm wide organiser for magazines.  You can get a lot of magazines in there, but once it's full, a few have to be thrown out to fit any new ones.  This has been useful for stopping piles of half read magazines invading all corners of the house.<br><br>The difficulty I see with these techniques is that they smack of prioritisation, which MF explains well as being counterproductive in the long run, and they will tend to focus attention on the recent and the urgent rather than long-run important goals.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2010 at 9:57 | David C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David:<br><br>Thanks for these thoughts. In fact this very issue is the one which has prompted me to go back to looking at DIT again. Hopefully once I have succeeded in my revisions (which are being a bit of a struggle at the moment) it will provide a solution!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2010 at 10:45 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David,<br><br>Good stuff.  I like Aslett as well.  (Love his briefcase ;-)  I liked his idea of talking photos of stuff you can't let go of, keeping the photo and dumping the object itself.<br><br>We have lots of tools to get around the RESULTS of the problem today.  If you love a book, know you will probably never read it again, yet can't give it up ... scan it and it will outlive you on optical media but take virtually zero storage.  Donate your Minox to a museum for example after lovingly photographing it with your new Digital camera ;-)  Can you even get film for that any longer?  Do you even have a lab for processing it?  But yeah, I lusted after a Minox in my misspent youth ;-)<br><br>I say "results" because clutter is only an effect.  The problem is not letting go ... of not living fully in the moment.  There is a Buddhist Sutra (actually more of a teaching story) about a monk who serves a king for some time.  As he leaves the employment, the king gives him a tiny figure of a cat, encrusted with jewels.  Walking out of the gate, and down the road, he contemplates the beautiful object for a moment, then hands it to a beggar and continues on, knowing that if he kept it, it would be just one more thing to hold him back from his journey.<br><br>Personally, I have a tough time letting go of by bejeweled cats (to say nothing of my real ones ;-)  Just a moment ago I was chatting with Seraphim on my list about old computers we worked on in our youth.  I related stories about the IBM 360/91 ... then I remembered a paper I wrote on the pipeline processor, then my mind drifted to the Ken Iverson book which modeled that computer in the original APL system ... then I wondered where that book is.  I know I still have it.  It is in a box some where as I tried to make room and get rid of old stuff.  But could I ever let go of that book?  It means so much to me ... but only when I reminisce.  I never look at it.  I can't even find it.  How funny we can be.<br><br>For some of this stuff I find that two practices help me.  1) I give stuff away to someone who will love it as much as I do.  IOW, it does not seem a "loss" to me if someone else gets joy from my treasures.  2) I use the "holding" technique you describe ... put it in a box to get rid of and give it some time to see if it wants to be rescued.  A third thing that helps is to go through the stuff MANY times.  There is some kind of comparative value things have, much like the comparative resistance we feel to tasks on the AF list.  If I have 100 things and I clean them out, I may feel I can part with 10 of them.  But the next time I go through the 90 remaining, I might find that I can let go of 8 or 10 more.  Each time there are a few that seem less important and can go.  I don't know, it seems to work.<br><br>As to the AF list, I don't see any problem with clutter there.  Sure lots of stuff is "someday/maybe/mostlikelynever" but that's O.K.  Mark it in yellow and move on.  It can live in the archives forever with you being secure that it is never really "gone".  It takes no space there.  One day you can decide to get rid of your museum of old AF books and photocopy the pages for archival and they will outlive you on optical media.  ROTF ;-)<br><br>Nice post, David.  Very thoughtful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2010 at 12:12 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi David, <br>Mark had a very good post on simplifying a couple of years ago which I think is relevant to your decluttering situation.  Here's what he says <br><br>"So the real question is not “What priority is this?” but “Should I be doing this at all?” "<br><br>In the case of your decluttering, maybe you would ask the question "should I be keeping this at all?"  My question for that as I'm doing a big decluttering job now is "is this beautiful or useful", not how much I paid for it or I'd never get rid of anything. :-)<br><br>Here's Mark's full post:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/3/26/simplify.html">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/3/26/simplify.html</a><br><br>You also might find it motivating to watch this series called Hoarders, it's shows the extreme effects of holding onto junk and helps me to be more ruthless when purging:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.aetv.com/hoarders/video/">http://www.aetv.com/hoarders/video/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2010 at 15:23 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>brilliant reflection, David. <br><br>Your post gave me a lot to think about. I especially love the idea of a "regular clean-out". It is comparable with Marks tips on how to work with a mail backlog in DIT. I am finding it liberating to have a clean desk, a clean inbox, a clean DIT/AF list once in a while. I will think about it and try to incorporate that into my system (or start using DIT2 ;-))<br><br>Thank you,<br>scameronde</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2010 at 16:08 | scameronde</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>An excellent post David and this is a topic on which I am giving much thought myself at the moment.   However I have found that by recognising the problem it has helped me a lot of dealing with backlog.  I also use the Flylady technique of putting on a timer and de-cluttering for 15 mins at a time.<br><br>One thing I have found very useful for books is a website called read it swap it (it's a dot co dot uk).  You can list all your books on here and swap them with people who really want to read them.  This means your book is going to a good home and you get to read a book from someone elses list for the price of the postage.<br><br>Paperwork is my current bug-bear.  I am working through it, but it is painful!  I see information that could be useful for my business and end up with so much stuff I have no sensible way of using itor even finding it!  When I look at it after a long time, it is no longer relevant or useful!  Once the paper work is sorted the next item on the list os my extensive wardrobe - most of which doesn't fit me - plus I never have anything to wear!!!<br><br><br>Looking forward to hearing more of this topic!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2010 at 20:14 | Alison R</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
