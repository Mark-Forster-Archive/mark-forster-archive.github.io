Please note this is purely a matter of describing the system better - it does not involve any changes to the system.<br><br>------------------------------------<br><br>Normal AF1 rules, except:<br><br>1. There is a second column (Column 2) on each page which can be used when you are working on a page for:<br><br>    a. Re-entering unfinished tasks;<br><br>    b. Entering tasks which you want to do now (Note 1)<br><br>2. Column 2 is treated as a part of the page for all purposes, including dismissal.<br><br>3. If there is insufficient room in Column 2 for more tasks, then any further tasks for it are entered in the 2nd column of the next available page. (Note 2)<br><br>4. When you have taken action on a task and have re-entered it in Column 2, but there are no other tasks remaining on the page, you may transfer the task to Column 2 of the next available page. You may also transfer the task in the same way when there are other tasks remaining on the page but you do not wish to take action on them for the time being. (See Note 3)<br><br>5. If under Rule 4 a task is transferred to another page but no other task stands out for action on that page, then the transferred task is transferred again and all tasks remaining on the page are dismissed (including any in Column 2). (See Note 4)<br><br>6. The purpose of rules 4 and 5 is to prevent a re-entered unfinished task from not having any other task to alternate with.<br><br><br>Notes:<br><br>1) This is intended to be used for anything you want to do now, not just urgent tasks.<br><br>2) This imposes a limit on how long new material can be added to a page.<br><br>3) The effect of this is to allow one task to continue to be worked on for more than one page.<br><br>4) This means a page does not avoid dismissal just because a new task has been added to it under Rule 4.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2010 at 17:13 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Does this mean that each page (except the newest page) consists of a closed list (column 1) and an open list (column 2)? <br>Column 2 gets closed when there is no more space left in it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2010 at 17:39 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, though in practice the two columns are treated as one page. So it might be more helpful to say that Column 2 is a way of keeping each page open to a limited extent.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2010 at 17:42 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>I think these instructions are much clearer, thanks Mark.<br><br>So according to these, all tasks in Column 2 are for all intents and purposes are handled the same way as in Column 1 when it comes to the dismissal process.  In other words, if I arrive at a page, do only one task in Column 2, then decide that there's no other task to work on in either Column 1 or 2, then the page is still not dismissed, right?<br><br>God bless!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2010 at 19:12 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym:<br><br>Yes, that's right. If a task is already on the page, whichever column it's in, then it's treated as normal for the dismissal rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2010 at 19:40 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Superfocus sounds great, Mark.  This is getting too exciting!    I liked original AF1 and had worked my way through all the versions of Autofocus, and then on to DWM then the recent change to DWM, using continuous entry rather than a new page for each day.  Within the last week I'd started experimenting with the 3-Task system, when along came Superfocus, which I started using today.  It's like being in a sweetie-shop and being spoiled for choice.  Thanks so much for all your hard work, and thanks to all the forum members for their input.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2010 at 22:09 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>let's say that I have a page that has been completely dismissed several days ago. This page has a task on it that has been dismissed and not been finished. And there is still some empty space in the second column. <br><br>Now I want to restart working on that dismissed task and I intend to enter it (in a re-phrased way) in the second column of this mentioned page. Would this be okay (re-opening the whole page) or should I chose another (newer) page?<br><br>In AF1 a page that has been dismissed would stay closed for ever, but what about Superfocus?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 11:01 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Rainer:<br><br>What do you see as the advantages of doing this, rather than re-entering the task on the last page?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 11:59 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Don't know if there is a real advantage in this, maybe just my laziness.<br><br>When I do my weekly review I go through old pages and look for dismissed tasks that need to be re-entered. Writing them on the same old page I wouldn't have to go to the latest page every time when I want to re-enter a dismissed task.<br><br>My question behind this is: Is the mental energy which is saved by doing this worth the risk of possible chaos that I might induce with this?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 12:15 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well, the main disadvantage would be the difficulty in keeping track of which pages are active and which are not. If you've resuscitated a page which is a long way back in your notebook, you may keep forgetting about it. <br><br>I expect it's quite possible to think up some way of overcoming this, but why expend the mental energy when all you have to do is write the task at the end of the list? Re-writing the task also helps to recommit yourself to it in your mind.<br><br>If you use a Moleskine as I do, then you have an elasticated band which can be used to keep the last page open. That way it's the natural thing to write on that page, rather than earlier ones.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 12:57 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The more I think about it,  the more I come to the conclusion that the risk of forgetting about a resurrected page is too high.   My notebook  doesn't have an elastic band, but I'll use a big bookmark for the last page. Thanks, Mark.<br><br>So, my additional rule is: "Don't resurrect old dismissed pages!"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 13:18 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Rainer:<br><br>&lt;&lt; My notebook  doesn't have an elastic band, &gt;&gt;<br><br>You can always use an ordinary elastic band.

I do have one question.  One can add anything that is urgent or they would like to do on the right hand column.  I have found it to be worthwhile to review all of my pages in the morning when I start the day.  Let's say I left off on page 4 and I have 10 pages.  By reviewing all of my pages quickly first thing in the morning, I refresh my memory of everything on my plate and can have the -- yes, I want to do this today -- kind of moment.  So if I find something let's say on page 9, do I go ahead and add that to the right hand column on the page I left off -- page 4?<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 14:13 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David:<br><br>Yes, you can do that, though I wouldn't put too many.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 15:42 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>It sounds like this is not something that should be routinely done.  But when you say you can add anything to the right handed column that you want to do, do you have a time frame in mind as to when these will be done?  I guess I am a little confused.  I thought that after reviewing all of my pages and coming up with things that I really want to do today, I would add those to the right hand column of the page I left off from last evening.  Is this not correct?<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 16:02 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That would be closer to My System, David.  I think Mark intended you only write the thing you want to do Now (rule 1b), not things you want to do Today.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 16:24 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Alan,<br><br>Thanks for your reply.  Okay -- that makes it more clear.  I guess I was misinterpreting what Mark meant as to adding things to the right column per rule 1b.<br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 16:45 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>I am trying to understand the SAF and have a couple of questions.  If you have a task in column one which you work on and don't finish, in AF you would add it to the end of the list.  In SAF do you always put it in the right hand column as opposed to the end of the list?  I am having a hard time understanding the right hand column.  It seems this column can also become a very long list which seems to defeat the focus of Triple Task.  Does SAF increase the amount of rewriting?  So far I am having a hard time understanding how this modification improves focus, maybe it is that I just don't understand it.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 17:05 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry:<br><br>Yes, that's right. Unfinished tasks are re-entered in the right-hand column, not the end of the list. You of course define what "unfinished" means.<br><br>Why do you think that would produce a very long list?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 18:00 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I guess I was misinterpreting what Mark meant as to adding things to the right column per rule 1b. &gt;&gt;<br><br>The definition of "now" for this purpose means "while I'm working on the page I'm currently on".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 18:03 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>So a new task you do not want to do now goes on the left and <br><br>a new task you want to do now or unfinished task goes on the right.<br><br>It seems to me this is a mix of urgencies on the right hand column.  Eventually all unfinished tasks go to the right column, causing it to loose it place as where urgent stuff goes.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 21:21 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mostly, a new task you don't want now goes on the back page, not the current page, because the left column of the current page is full.  So the right side is not for urgent stuff as much as it is for stuff you're doing while on this page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 21:28 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>The left column may not be full if it like AF1, so wouldn't a new task you don't want to do now go on the first blank line of the "left" column?  What is the back page, I did not see that.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 21:52 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In AF1, every page but the last is full.  Here, the left column is always full except for that of the last page, which is open to new tasks.<br><br>You aren't usually working on that last page, so whatever you work on must go to the right.  It won't fit anywhere else.<br><br>When you *are* working on the last page, you would still rewrite to the right so a suitable variety of new tasks can fill up the left side.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2010 at 22:16 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry:<br><br>&lt;&lt; So a new task you do not want to do now goes on the left and a new task you want to do now or unfinished task goes on the right. &gt;&gt;<br><br>A new task always goes at the *end* of the list in the left-hand column, unless you need to do it now. In that case it can instead be added to the page you are currently working on. It has to go in the right column because the left column of every page (except the last page) is full.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 November 2010 at 1:28 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Isn't rule 4 superfluous? When I decide to go on the next page, in any case I can add the task again on the right side of the page. Thus, it is easy to move a task through the pages and to have the possibility to do it whenever I like or need to do it. And by this I can also carry more than a single task with me through the pages. <br> <br>Wolfgang</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 November 2010 at 7:07 | wowi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>After some further thinking, I see a difference: When I transfer the task according to rule 4, I mark it as done on the old page (is that the correct understanding of transferring?). Thus, the task exists only on one page, without this rule it may sit on all pages which I have crossed. But if I like to take more than a single task with me on my way through the pages, I have to use the other possibility anyway.<br><br>Wolfgang</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 November 2010 at 7:28 | wowi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One of the things I learned over the last two years was not to pre-judge any system. I am really stubborn and I really thought nothing could be better than DIT. Or AF4. Or DWM. I was really excited last week with DWM2+3TS. I finished two major things (one that had a hard deadline, and the other that was bugging me -- my "disappearing" disk space). Just a disclaimer to say that I am really resisting the idea of SuperFocus. But I did start it yesterday, and I am trying to trust the system. :) Yesterday was a bit slow because it was a holiday where I live, so the real pressure will be on today and tomorrow.<br><br>That said, I have been thinking about why I am resisting SF so much, much more than any other system jump before. Having followed AF1 for a few months, I have a clear understanding where it breaks down for me. Perhaps the left column trick does really address those shortcomings. I hope it does; maybe not in the same way as DWM2+3TS, but I am sure I will learn something from trying.<br><br>Just as a reminder of I have written before:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I confess that after some months AF1 was a bit impractical to me. This was mainly because of the erratic nature of my job: I sometimes spend weeks coming to university and working 9-to-5, and sometimes I work from home days at end; and some weeks I just mix and match commuting days and work-from-home days. Keeping 2 notebooks will never work for me (as I love being able to go back and forth between commuting and not as the situation poses itself), and the stalactite-stalagmite method was too chaotic to work for a long time. &gt;&gt;<br><br>In few words, AF1 breaks down to me because my work tasks flow faster than home/fun/recurrent* tasks. Therefore, if dismissal of the latter type follows the pace of the former, I end up with a stoic list that is not at all enjoyable. (AF4 breaks down for me for the opposite reason: too slow a dismissal leaves many type 2 items, which clutter everything up; DWM dismissal had a good balance in dismissing fast-flowing and slow-flowing tasks.)<br><br>* Mark said that on AF1/SF he puts only daily recurrent tasks, and weekly, monthly recurrences are treated by Outlook reminders. I did that with all AFs, but DWM allowed me to include weekly and monthly recurrent tasks on my list, without the need of external reminders for them. I quite liked them on my list. Maybe that is just a matter of getting used to it again.<br><br>tl;dr: I am anxious about my SF list, but I am trying it anyway. I wrote the above just to find out why I fear it more than the other system changes.

This is because the left-hand (main entry) column/page already has its tasks eligible for working in the current session (the 'Now').<br><br>So the tasks eligible for writing down in the RH column/page are (1) tasks which are already listed on other LH pages except the current visible one, and which one feels compelled or driven to do now, and (2) tasks which have come to the fore out of the blue (by external or internal forces!) and which one wants to do now or must do now.<br><br>So is not a (2) task a sort of 'Below the Line' as in DIT, or earlier technique?  If so, then this is record of such sudden 'unplanned' and unlisted tasks (for whatever reason, forgetfulness, didn't write it down etc).<br><br>One query (which may have been asked and answered previously, somewhere):<br><br>If you work on a current LH column/page task, but do not complete it at first, do you still cross it off and immediately write it on the RH side as a reminder that it's upcoming in the current session?  Or do you rewrite it at the end of the list on the last page (LH) and then retrieve it later?<br><br>Sorry if all the above is not clear, that's why God got Moses to reveal the Commandments and not Roger J.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 November 2010 at 16:46 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Roger:  I write it on the right.
