But an interesting new series of studies points out that often we are just as likely to put off activities that we find attractive and enjoyable.   <br><br>... People might have a tendency to put off not just less desirable tasks but desirable ones too ... one reason why this might be the case is the fact that people typically believe that they will have more time in the future to carry out enjoyable activities but fail to realize that they will likely be just as busy in the future. As a result they simply end up not completing the activity."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 8:58 | DavidC</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, David. I hadn't seen this article, but the belief that in some magical time in the future we will have more time than we have today is one I kept going on about when this Forum was mainly about DIT.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 9:07 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A long-standing problem I had was that I couldn't plan fun stuff because I didn't get important stuff done.  I didn't get important stuff done because I procrastinated and did random fun stuff instead.  And this was because I wasn't clear on what things needed to be done and I figured it wouldn't be much.  Well perhaps it wasn't much but since I never got to it... :-(<br><br>I don't feel so behind anymore, but caught up.  I do want to get a little ahead on some things, and then I should feel free to relax and plan bigger and better things.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 14:04 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David,<br><br>First, I think that what a lot of Mark's systems do--and why they are good--is create a sense of urgency. If I feel that I have an abundance of time, I can put things off. If my list tells me that time is about to run out, I feel compelled by urgency.<br><br>This flies in the face of Coveyesque "urgency vs. importance" classifications. But I personally find it helpful to trick myself into making stuff urgent. I think that that is part of the reason why I like DWM so much. <br><br>There is another study that associates happiness with minds that are focused on present tasks and unhappiness with minds that wander:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101111141759.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101111141759.htm</a><br><br>Presumably, if I could reduce the amount that my mind wanders, I could increase my happiness. I want to increase my happiness. So, how can I reduce the amount my mind wanders?<br><br>I have not seen the original study. But it seems possible that one can be focused by doing little and often. That is, one can wander from task to task with high frequency, as long as one is focused on whatever is the current task at hand. <br><br>I am going to try to be super-strict about only doing things after I write them down. I'll see if that keeps me more focused and happier.<br><br>Meanwhile, the larger picture states that I want a task system that:<br><br>  keeps me organized<br>  keeps me focused<br>  keeps me feeling a sense of urgency</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 November 2010 at 18:15 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"This flies in the face of Coveyesque "urgency vs. importance" classifications.

Without a serious external punishment i.e. stickk.com (which I've had success with), the internal slap-on-the-wrist stops working after a couple of weeks. <br><br>Currently, I'm using Get Sh-t Done with average results.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 November 2010 at 2:50 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum,<br><br>I started with DIT, and then did, in order, AF1, AF2, AF3, AF4, and DWM. I have been doing DWM for excel since March 1, 2010. <br><br>What I liked about all of Mark's systems was that they created a sense of urgency for me. I would reach a point where, if I continued to procrastinate, I would be forced to drop some task that was important to me. That always focused my attention and got me working on it. <br><br>Rationally, the "deadline" was totally artificial. It was an artifact of the system. But, for me, it worked. <br><br><br>It's banal, but we each have to find what works with how we are constituted. I have used deadlines in the past, and I would blithely proceed to ignore them. With Mark's systems I actually experienced a feeling of real urgency that I did not have before.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 November 2010 at 20:58 | moises</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
