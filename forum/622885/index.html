I don't understand how  that would work.<br><br>Clearly, you would list your possible books.<br>And you would scan the list.<br><br>But as you scan are looking for the first "right" item from the entire list? And you happen to find a book?<br><br>Or do you scan specifically looking for books and then find the "right" book from the subset of books?<br><br>It's not that I'm that interested in a book list, but curious about the thinking that goes into the process.<br><br>Thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2009 at 14:49 | ds</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ds:<br><br>What I did was enter the 57 book titles into my Autofocus list. I then treated them as tasks just like any other task.<br><br>I didn't scan the whole list, just one page at a time.<br><br>I wouldn't particularly recommend this exercise to anyone. I was just curious what would happen. In fact what did happen was that I did several of the tasks (i.e. read a bit of some of the books) and the rest got dismissed.One of the books I started has since been dismissed too, but the rest I am still reading.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2009 at 17:47 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I know a lot of people who maintain a "pile of books to read", even for their leisure lecture. I dropped this concept long ago. When I buy a book, I put it on the shelf among all the others of its kind (SF to SF, thrillers to thrillers, science to science etc.), whether read or not. Only when I am in need for a new book to start, I walk along my library and wait until a book jumps at me. Very much like "tasks standing out": the back of the book seems to gloom, to twinker at me... calling "hey, the time has come to have a look inside!" This way, reading remains fun.<br><br>It's another thing with books I HAVE to read (research etc.), I have to admit.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2009 at 19:10 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like that idea Andreas, but to go one step further, you should limit your search to one shelf. Only if no book jumps out at you should you move to the next shelf. And of course if there are a few books on the shelf you are ready to dismiss, I recommend using a highlighter on the book's spine :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2009 at 20:41 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As a major bibliophile, I had books scattered all over my house - bookshelves in the bedroom, living room and basement, a library with built-in bookshelves completely full, boxes of them in the garage...<br><br>One of my first Autofocus tasks has been to organize my books and actually *find* the ones I wanted to read and have them in one place.  I also wanted to let go of the ones that weren't keepers and keep a maximum of 8 shelves of those I wanted to keep - by subject area - and neatly too, not so I have them all crammed in to the maximum capacity.  Many of the books in my *to be read* group had been purchased a long time ago - but I wasn't willing to dismiss them.   Having them in one place means that when I go camping, on holiday or travel for business, I can quickly grab a book (or three!) to pack along.   I keep a storage box full of about 30 books in my camper and am not allowing myself to carry more than that.<br><br>I very rarely buy books anymore and after donating thousands of books over the years, I have made a rule for myself that I will not buy a book unless I have requested it from the library and really decided it's worth it.  Most libraries allow requests from the collections across your state/province.  I am also hoping that by adding the library books I get to my "to be read" area, I won't lose track of them as I have in the past.  We also have a book trading center at my local recycling center where you can exchange your books.  I often find myself wanting to pick up one, then recalling that I was the one that donated it!  When I go on holiday, I bring books that I've wanted to read but know I won't want to keep and leave them in the hotel / airport / cruise ship library when I'm finished.  I hope they don't get thrown away...<br><br>I do find that I am reading far less since I've been doing AF, but that's a good thing as I estimate I used to read about 10 books a week prior to starting.  Too much of a good thing...  I originally included a task of "read 'current book' " on my list, but would constantly gravitate towards that task in my discretionary time and never go back to the list so I've begun just reading before bed and for a couple of hours on weekends.  I don't watch TV so it's my equivalent of sitting down in front of the TV and wasting an entire night when I could be doing something to progress towards my goals.  <br><br>I'm not sure what I'll do when I move into the motorhome on my sabbatical at the end of this year.  I'm hoping that instead of just reading other people's work, I'll have the time to write my own which has been a goal of mine for years that I've never made the time to do (scheduling writing time didn't work for me...)  I had initially thought of buying an Amazon Kindle but I think the temptation would be too great to buy a lot of books and they make it so easy to download them.  I'd like to set a limit of about 80 books which amounts to 10 per month which I can leave at campgrounds along the way as I'm finished with them.  I've also thought of going cold turkey and not bringing any at all to see what life is like on the other side.  A scary thought indeed...<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 March 2009 at 12:54 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>vegheadjones:<br><br>ROFL! :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 March 2009 at 14:36 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I must be totally out of it, I thought veghead was serious!
