I think the highlighting step is what I'm really resisting. Mark wrote that highlighting items helps them stand out to be reviewed. To me, highlighting them calls attention to some kind of failure on my part. I know, that's my issue, not the system's, but I've finally realized that it's the highlighting that I don't like. <br><br>The items that I have dismissed, I've by-passed the highlighting step and just moved it to my 'Dismissed from SF' list in OmniFocus. <br><br>Even if I highlighted and then crossed out, that highlighting would still taunt me. <br><br>Any thoughts to help me get over this, or any alternatives that don't bend the rules too much?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2011 at 22:38 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I resisted dismissal for a long time also, but now I think it's fun!   Last night I was really looking forward to dismissing a page full of tasks and was disappointed that one of those tasks stood out.  :-(<br><br>The dismissal feature provides opportunities for growth, for process improvement, for goals clarification, and the like, far more than any other single feature of the SF system.  <br><br>For some reason, the one single thing that helped me transition from resistance to acceptance of dismissal, was one of Mark's posts.    He was sick with the flu, and either didn't feel like doing the things on the page, or just physically couldn't.   And so he was dismissing with abandon.   That insight into how Mark works with dismissal really clicked with me -- dismissal is not some kind of failure -- it's a reflection of your current set of priorities, your current state of mind, your current state of health, your current work-life balance, and lots of other things.   Dismissal, when you really start using it, helps your intuition speak more clearly.  <br><br>I suppose the main difference now is that I used to look at it as "Oh no, now I've got to figure out how to change my work processes so I can get all those dismissed items done -- and I don't know how in the world I can squeeze out any more efficiency".   And that made me feel depressed.   "This is never going to work."   <br><br>But now I look forward to dismissal and reviewing the dismissed items, because it always gives me so many new insights.  In the end makes me feel so much better about my work, my work-life balance, and whether or not I am achieving the results that really matter in my life.<br><br>Not sure if any of this helps.  I'm still not quite sure what helped me make that transition...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2011 at 0:01 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Does the highlighting not bother you?<br><br>ETA: I've grabbed the highlighter.

To me, highlighter means important. Also, I like to tear out, scrunch up and throw out finished pages. (Yes, small things amuse small minds.)<br><br>Some information is lost with the rewrite method, though. With highlighting, I always know when I first wrote it down. That's easy enough to fix by the date as I copy it. Another benefit is I know when I admitted that now is not the time, and I can see how often a project bounces between active and dismissed. If it happens frequently, I ask hard questions.<br><br>Things still get dismissed, I just indicate it in a different way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2011 at 2:58 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I do like the highlighter, for the simple reason that it makes the dismissed tasks easy to find.

But if you happen to read the task, that's okay no biggie."  Later when you're doing the Review dismissed, the highlighed pages will make it easy to find them, the highlighted tasks make it easy to find them, and when a page is finally done (highlighted tasks deleted, maybe reentered), cross it or crease it so you never need to consider it again.<br><br>This should not feel like a problem.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2011 at 14:40 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Alan<br>'A highlighted task on a page means "Don't even look at this page, let alone this task"...<br>This should not feel like a problem.'<br><br>I have been conditioned all my life to think of highlighters as highlighting something important. They draw attention, they don't signal 'ignore for now'. <br><br>I have highlighted 28 tasks across 5 pages. I'll review them tomorrow. We'll see how I feel about having the items highlighted and not crossed out and then crossed out. Since I'm nearing the end of my book and will have to move to a new one fairly soon, I figure it is the perfect time to try to do this by the rules. <br><br>I still, at this time, wish there was another way to anti-highlight something, other than a highlighter.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2011 at 15:18 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Malisa:<br><br>What kind of mark would create a feel-good state around dismissal? <br><br>It seems to me you need to associate dismissal with clarity and confidence in what you are about - a "this is not who I am or what I want" marker. Or maybe two: "not what I'm about NOW" and a "not who I am EVER". Or perhaps change the name from "dismissal" to "irrelevant" or "unwanted" or "not preferred". Perhaps that is a gentler or more accepting attitude to unwanted activity, or a way of rewarding focus on the preferred. <br><br>Perhaps marking these tasks with a "N" for "Nope, Not me" for example. (After a week I suppose one gets a clearer self-image by looking back at all the "N"s)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2011 at 18:37 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Malisa:<br><br>Dismissed tasks are highlighted not just so that you can find them again but because they ARE important. "Dismissed" in this context means the same as in "Class dismissed". You have finished with them for the moment, but you expect them back again soon!<br><br>Tasks that you have dismissed are those which the system has decided should be reviewed. This reviewing is a very important part of getting the phrasing and level of tasks and projects right, as well as keeping the whole system (i.e. your life) focussed.<br><br>It probably wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that dismissal is the most essential part of SuperFocus, giving the whole system its bite and focus. As such the dismissed tasks deserve to be highlighted!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2011 at 18:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would amend Mark's comment, to say that the act of dismissing particular tasks is important, rather than any one of the specific tasks being of importance. It's telling you something about yourself or your circumstances, that you listed something to do and failed to take action on it. The anxiety you feel by using the highlighter is real, and necessary to get through. It means that you are taking the process seriously, and (it is hoped) learning how to plan and do things better in the future.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2011 at 19:21 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>malisa, I have some of the same concerns as you. To keep the highlighted tasks from grabbing my attention, I use a blue highlighter instead of the typical yellow one. (For clarity, blue is the only color I use in my SF list.) I'm used to seeing yellow highlighting for important stuff. Blue is a more subdued color and doesn't trigger the "HEY LOOK" reaction from me.<br><br>I also have deep reservations about dismissing items. When I write down a task, I feel like I have a responsibility to DO that task. I struggle with that feeling when I dismiss something because my first reaction is that I've not lived up to my responsibility. Will Mark's "class dismissed" analogy help me with that attitude? I hope so, and I hope that his and others' comments help you as well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2011 at 19:31 | jFenter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There ought to be a grey coloured highlighter - call it a lowlighter.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 March 2011 at 19:48 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ubi,<br><br>Remember that the tasks on your list are not committed until you do some work on them.

But I will still take responsibility, even if it's my intuitive side that resulted in a task not calling itself out to be done.  However you want to phrase it, I came to the page and chose not to take action on a remaining task.  So the page gets dismissed.
