Dreams (vision-driven, near no-list, intuitive action)<br>Best fit: NP types (ENFP, INFP, ENTP, INTP).<br>These personalities thrive on inspiration, exploration, and emergent direction.<br>They dislike heavy structures and love flexibility.<br>Secondary fit: Some SP types (ESFP, ISFP) who like free-flow spontaneity.<br><br>2. Simple Scanning (single long list, intuitive scanning, no dismissal rules)<br>Best fit: NPs again, especially ENTP / ENFP.<br>They enjoy freedom but like at least a central “basket” of options.<br>Secondary fit: INFP / INTP who want light structure but not commitments.<br>Least suited: Strong J types (need closure).<br><br>3. Autofocus (long list + scanning rules/dismissals, intuitive but with structure)<br>Best fit: NTPs (ENTP, INTP) — rules + play.<br>They like experimentation and tinkering with systems.<br>Also suited: ENFP / INFP who need gentle boundaries.<br>Appeal to some Js: Especially INFJ / INTJ who like “organic-seeming structure.”<br><br>4. Final Version / FVP (long-list mechanics with page rules; usable in long or short modes)<br>Best fit: NFJs (ENFJ, INFJ) and NTJs (ENTJ, INTJ).<br>It gives the predictability of a framework but leaves some room for adaptation.<br>Secondary fit: NPs who want to “bridge” into structure.<br>Appeal: Versatile — middle-ground system.<br><br>5. Do It Tomorrow (DIT) (closed daily list, short, protected, structured)<br>Best fit: SJs (ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ).<br>They like clear boundaries, daily closure, and predictable order.<br>Also fits: NJ planners (INTJ, ENTJ) who want protected focus.<br>Least suited: Free-floating NPs (feels confining).<br><br>6. Get Everything Done (GED) (multiple rotating lists, segmented and rule-driven)<br>Best fit: NTJs (INTJ, ENTJ).<br>They enjoy managing complex frameworks and seeing systemic balance.<br>Also fits: Some STJs who like order through segmentation.<br>Least suited: SPs and freewheeling NPs.<br><br>In Spectrum Order<br>Open / Intuitive end (P-types, especially NPs): Dreams → Simple Scanning → Autofocus.<br>Balanced / bridging middle (NJs and some FJs): Final Version.<br>Closed / Structured end (J-types, especially SJs &amp; NTJs): Do It Tomorrow → Get Everything Done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 August 2025 at 2:54 | Mark H.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(I then noticed that ChatGPT had not listed the system from the book Secrets of Productive People, so I asked it to include it, and this was the answer)<br><br>Perfect, thanks for bringing this in — the Secrets of Productive People (SoPP) book sits a little differently than Forster’s other systems, since it’s more a toolkit/philosophy + a few light micro-systems (like 5/2) rather than a single closed method like Do It Tomorrow or Final Version.<br><br>If we place it into the spectrum you outlined (Dreams → Simple Scanning → Autofocus → Final Version → Do It Tomorrow → GED), I’d suggest:<br><br>📍 Where Secrets of Productive People Fits<br><br>Overall: Not a “system” but a framework/book of principles. It’s designed for flexibility and reflection.<br><br>Core micro-system (5/2): A small, low-friction list approach (always have 5 tasks on your list, aim to complete 3, then top up). This is mid-spectrum: not as fluid as Dreams or Simple Scanning, but much lighter than DIT or GED.<br><br>Placement:<br>👉 Between Autofocus and Final Version, slightly leaning toward Autofocus.<br><br>Like Autofocus, it balances freedom with a little structure (top-up rules).<br><br>Like FV, it offers mechanical rules, but they’re minimal and optional.<br><br>Unlike DIT/GED, it doesn’t “close” the system; it leaves plenty open.<br><br>🔮 MBTI Types Drawn to Secrets of Productive People<br><br>Based on its strengths and weaknesses:<br><br>ENFP / ENTP (Ne-dominant) → Attracted to the flexible, idea-rich, philosophical toolkit. They’ll enjoy browsing the “secrets” and experimenting.<br><br>INFJ / INFP → Appreciate the attitudinal/mindset focus, realistic thinking, and the balance of fewer, better tasks. The reflective exercises will resonate.<br><br>ENTJ / ESTJ → Might find the book’s fragmented/philosophical tone frustrating, but could lock onto the 5/2 method as a practical mini-structure.<br><br>ISTJ / ISFJ → Will probably dislike the looseness of the book unless they pair 5/2 with a more robust structure like DIT.<br><br>✅ So in short: Secrets of Productive People is philosophy + micro-system. It sits in the middle spectrum (near Autofocus) and best appeals to intuitive personality types (N), while structured types (SJs especially) would need to anchor it with a more rigid system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 August 2025 at 3:11 | Mark H.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is my comment on the above: <br><br>Taking into account that ChatGPT as far as I know is not a human being or a psychologist, and the placing of Mark Forster's systems on a spectrum is somewhat speculative, nevertheless the principle that productive systems fit certain personality types seems to me the best explanation, apart from the wisdom of the system itself, for why certain systems work for some but not others.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 August 2025 at 3:24 | Mark H.</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
