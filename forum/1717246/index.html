Also a checklist for new enquiries from potential new customers.<br><br>Thing is I don't know where to keep them.

It does have webbased. There are multiple approaches:<br><br>1. A page with checkboxes that you click on/off<br>2. A section with pages you drag below the done line.<br>3. A section with pages you indent (making a subpages) to mean checked.<br>4. For systems, I created an outline:<br>Top level is the process steps.<br>Second level is (eg) customers. <br>I move the customer pages physically from one step to the next.<br>5.

They all fit on one page. I print it out on full-sheet Post-It label paper on Sunday night and cut the appropriate strip from it each morning and stick it onto a daily C.A.N. page in my pocket notebook (CheckLists, Appointments, Notes). I have slightly different routines each day of the week, so this approach makes sense for me. <br><br>Checklists are really helpful for two reasons: (1) you avoid having to reenter all the mundane things in your to-do list; and (2) you can put important routine reminders in that will save you from frustrations. As an example of the latter, I have a checklist item to make sure my work badge is in my backpack. I usually keep it there, but occasionally leave it in my jacket pocket or bike bag. It's very frustrating to commute to work in the morning and not have your badge, but it's not the kind of thing I want to keep entering into my to-do list, since I rarely forget it. Having it on the checklist and getting in the habit of not leaving for work until the morning checklist is all ticked solves this problem.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2012 at 17:57 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If you just want to keep things simple, try using google docs.
