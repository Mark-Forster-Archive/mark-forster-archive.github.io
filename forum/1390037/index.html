Why does your system of choice appeal to you?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2011 at 11:52 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Still using a mixture of very simple ZTD/GTD, AF4 and scheduling.<br>And waiting for SuperFocus-3.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2011 at 12:44 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Erik I gona try to answer but a warn you what i will say is not very conventional.<br><br>I use a simple autofocus list on a paper notebook with 2 tips<br>1. is checkboxes that i check when something is unfinished<br>2. is a red high lines of tasks I MUST DO or URGENT. <br><br>The AF is treated as a all list. I read it pages after pages until nothing stand at me. <br><br>When after a few passes items still don't stand at me i cross them or dissmiss them with a YELLOW high liner if they can't be crossed. Then they go either on my ical agenda or they are reformulated. <br><br>I tried doing this on taskpaper or other digital tools. But there is a real mental impeachment to do things. I don't understand why. I know it would be better but it simply doesn't work for me. <br><br>The only thing I noticed is that my system works and especially if it is on paper. Little by little but it works. Even if i try other ways of doing things it works. Better or not but it works. <br><br>For my tasks, I rather prefer to cross something, reformulate and report what is unfinished. <br>I feel confident with the system. No complication, everything is easy and clear. <br><br>As I need for some projects to consults my notes about them I also have some projects on paper (they go either on paper files nor in my computer: a .page file or .text) <br>I also take sometime to work on my projects and kept a project list and a current initiative list which contains all regular task i might do per day. <br><br>All my essays to work on something else did not really worked. They brought me procratrination or blocked my ability to do things and intuition. <br><br>Trying to put my stuff on a computer by files or making things more rational such as using data base GTD tools and so on, hided all informations to my view and made me missed some precious opportunities. <br><br>So Now I use a single paper note book. Make things simple and do things instead of searching the graal of organisation. The only exception I make is echanging with others on the wonderfull forum. I love trying new ideas and asking to others their advices and point of view and I love when MF gives us is precious knowledge and experiments because he is for me one of the most famous guru of organization. <br><br>I also appreciate that he does it freely. It's a generous gift and a proof of his real humanism. <br><br>To summarize, even if it is on paper and not digital, I prefer a real mess and less organized system that an organized system that block all my creativity and efficiency. I am absolutely un able to understand why. May be it's a psychological aspect but i guess my organization is like a serie of shoe boxes where informations goes by theme and when i need it i simply dive into it to extract what i need. <br><br>AF appears to be the link of it. The hanker and the guideline of everything. The main central point in which nothing could happen if it was absent. It is so addictive and so powerful that i realize that this systems little by little leads me to success.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2011 at 12:50 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm just setting up SuperFocus - I reakon the 3rd version will be a rules change rather than major functionality change (but I could be wrong!) so I'll be ready to adopt as soon as it is published.  <br><br>I completely lost my focus recently so am starting over - I don't know what comes over me sometimes - I just seem to think I am drowing and burrow down into huddle and hope the world passes me by and neglect my lists etc. However something always happens to remind me that I can't maintain my hermit like nature and I get back into the saddle!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2011 at 12:50 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Still using SF+GKS...for the moment it's very effective.

The date-dependent dismissal meshes well with my personality and work habits.  <br><br>I also make heavy use of calendar reminders as a kind of tickler - if there's something I know I can't address now I put a reminder in my calendar for the earliest date when I think I WILL be able to deal with it.  I do the same for occasional repeating tasks (like reviewing dismissed items or remembering to put bleach in the furnace humidifier once a month).<br><br>Appointments are in my calendar.  Everything syncs between the web, my laptop, and my iPad.  On the off chance I don't have web access and don't have my iPad with me (it happens... rarely, but it happens) I can at the very least add items to my list via SMS, even if I can't read it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2011 at 15:51 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am not sure I can even call what I do now a system.  I have a spiral college ruled notebook and I write everything in it I need to do.  I date the page in the margin each day and I constantly review it to see what I think needs to be done and I do it.  I am writing business tasks front to back and personal back to front so everything is in one place.  The notebook stays at my desk during the day and I take it home at night in case I think of a work item to add and to add personal stuff.<br><br>For notes, I have gone to using simple legal pads.  It adds the step of having to sometimes review the legal pad to add things to the spiral notebook, but I found ripping notes out of the notebook and separating that extra piece of paper annoying.<br><br>For me I am not a rules person, so I never got along with automatic dismissal and other concepts like that.  The only thing I try to adhere to is to write tasks as something that can be done in a day or less.  so goals and other longer term projects are broken down into something I can do today.  This keeps things moving.  So build a house is not on the list, but call the architect for a resume is.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2011 at 15:59 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've got some strange cross-breed of SAF and AF4R going, with project pages.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2011 at 17:07 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>At work, I've been ignoring my lists and focusing on the main item on the project schedule.   As urgent stuff arises (bills, requests from spouse, etc.) I just do them immediately.   Meanwhile lots of other things suffer - but most of it deserves to suffer anyway.  :-)   When I finally get back to my list I'll probably find 50%+ of it no longer relevant.  <br><br>Hmm, that's what usually happens when I have lots of overtime demands at work, and lose a day or two because of migraines.  There's no time to think about it -- just get the main things done.  80% of the "recurring" items just don't get any attention at all.   The 20% that really need it (like feeding the cats and watering the garden and paying the bills) do get done, because they are ingrained habits and because they HAVE to get done.  <br><br>Problem is, when the pressure lets up, I feel kinda lost.  Right now, I have a little breather and used it to clean out my in box, and to catch up on this forum, and to think about whether I should get back to my list, or start a new one, or just wait for SAFv3.  Or, find a way to artificially create the pressure that helps me really focus on what's really important.  Or, realize that it's OK to go at 110% for a while, get a huge amount of work done, and then lay back for awhile afterwards.   <br><br>Is it better to keep an even keel at 80-90%, pretty much all the time, with an occasional break?   That seems to be the dominant model in the Western world, at least in the USA.  Keep up a fast pace, always working (or least making the appearance of being busy), and take an occasional week or two for vacation.  <br><br>Or is it better to go at 110% or 150%, neglecting sleep and basic needs, for several weeks or months, and then slacking off to 20-30% for another few weeks or months?   Some Mediterranean and Slavic cultures seem to follow this model.   Maybe it's because of the particular agricultural background of the culture or something.   <br><br>Both models seem to work.  E.g., in the "space race" the Americans followed the first model, the Russians the second model.  Both accomplished amazing things, both accomplished many "firsts".  <br><br>My periodic fits of migraine headaches seem to knock me out periodically, so I tend to follow the 150% / 30% model whether I like it or not.  <br><br>I'm hoping Mark will chime in and say "SAFv3 addresses all those issues", as he has many times with previous pre-release keep-them-in-suspense discussions.  :-)   (And he's always been right about that, by the way!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2011 at 18:07 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;Both models seem to work.

Modification -  I review it every morning or so and flag items that are pressing.  This is kept in a narrow, cheap, banged-up, ringbound narrow notebook that I found in a storage drawer.  The work one is nicer and something I can take to meetings; a legal pad and a clipboard.  ;)<br><br>I also keep a small notepad for keeping notes while on the go.  I sometimes carry an origami folded notebook from a sheet of paper.  It's perfect for me.  These notes are then placed in the AF list as needed.<br><br>Finally, not keeping it analog, I'm working through the "Make Your Dreams..." book and most of journaling for that is kept on my Google docs.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2011 at 12:12 | BryanR</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use a calendar to plan committed time and to feed timed tasks into AF. I then use a tweaked version of the original AF1 for selecting what to do during uncommitted time.<br><br>Both the calendar and the AF list are on paper. Using paper heavily constrains a system compared to digital flexibility, but to-do lists on a computer have always failed for me, after some time. Their lack of physical presence seems to make them too easy to just ignore.<br><br>I have applied two tweaks to standard Autofocus, one minor and one major.<br><br>The first and minor tweak could be called "batched activation." It came to be because I liked both Autofocus and the basic idea of "Do It Tomorrow" and greedily wanted to have both in one system.<br><br>The Rules: On the left margin of every page, tasks are marked by a vertical line drawn with a yellow highlitghter. As new items are added, they start out unmarked and are ignored during task selection. Activate new tasks in batches by extending the yellow line downward. If you only activate new tasks once every morning, you have "Do It Tomorrow".<br><br>I don't know if "batch activation" makes the system better.
