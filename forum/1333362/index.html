AF1 seems like a more elegant sytem compared with AF4R. <br><br>2. It's still possible to audit / snap shot the number of each item type. <br><br>3. It's still possible to dismiss items at the New stage before getting into a commitment and / or taking on too many things at once. <br><br>By the way, my use of 'New'  would basically be for those items at a  'project level' and above that have not been initiated at all.   <br><br>Has anyone already tried this?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 December 2010 at 12:50 | leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>leon:<br><br>I love AF1 myself, and prefer the "feel" of it to any other system.

The fixed size of the closed list (one page) is more consistent. It also works better with "Finally! I can tear out this page.")<br><br>Until I wrote the next bit, and realized I couldn't balance the pros/cons columns, I thought AF1 with NRU pages would work well. Now I think the "different" is actually breaking one AF1's key benefits.<br><br>I do Recurring tasks fairly quickly. I've already evaluated them many times before. Unfinished take a bit longer, since many are long-term, low-commitment projects that get dropped when the week gets busy, but I have invested enough time that I don't want to dismiss them. New take even longer and are the ones most at risk of dismissal.<br><br>Under AF1, there are a few long-lived New tasks on each page. Under AF1 with N/R/U they'd all be on one page.<br><br>Under the original AF1, as a page nears dismissal we have only a few tasks to choose from if we want to keep it open. That can lead to admitting we won't do any of them (good) or finally doing the tough one (good), or picking an unimportant one just so we can keep the page open without doing the tough one (bad).<br><br>With AF1-NRU, there's a much longer list to choose from. It can take many passes before we have to deal with the tough one (bad).<br><br>The organized part of me wants to separate Recurring from New and Unfinished. Recurring often have a short cycle so are written often. It feels like they waste space on the page. They're usually more important, so I want them visible.<br><br>The part that gets things done likes the effect of a few remaining things on the page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 December 2010 at 14:35 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It seems to me you could mark each page new, recurring, or unfinished just as in AF4r, then follow the Af1 flow through those pages. But I have serious doubts whether the recurring pages could cope with Af1 dismissal rules so maybe something different there or drop the category. <br><br>Mark: so you're less satisfied with SAF?  Is it just "less fun" or is there something more specific you don't like about it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 December 2010 at 14:36 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon,<br><br>several days ago I did what you wrote in your above post and the result was abhorring. <br><br>The problem is: that what Mark calls the "feel" is our own perception of our own instinctive reaction towards a certain item on the AF1 list. This perception gets blured or disturbed by attaching a logical tag or code to the item. Thus the list "feels dead" when this code is added.<br><br>The question is: What kind of decisions need to have that instinctive "gut feeling" input, and which decisions must be based on our logical mind? And why do we have trouble doing both at the same time?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 December 2010 at 14:38 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark wrote:<br>&lt;&lt;&lt;I love AF1 myself, and prefer the "feel" of it to any other system.

You wrote that SAF is "streets ahead of any of my other systems" (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1303467#post1303472).">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1303467#post1303472).</a>   But then you dropped it pretty quickly when you came up with the AF4 Revised approach.   <br><br>Personally I find SAF preserves much, if not all, of the feel of AF1, but the 2nd column idea gives you a great deal more control.  It solves AF1's inability to deal with "urgent".<br><br>My experiment combining SAF with the Recurring, Unfinished, and New pages of AF4R is going very well.

And it still feels very much like AF1 -- almost meditative.  I can't believe how fast the days have been going by.<br><br>I do miss the workload-gauging feature that DWM provided.  SAF doesn't provide nearly as clear a picture.  But the other benefits outweigh this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 December 2010 at 15:46 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>The trouble with me is that when I think of an idea I've got to try it out.

I've been gradually grouping things by "project" (i.e. anything that has more than one task, such as designing a rocket, cleaning my house, people to do stuff with, working out at the gym).  When I find a task fits in a "project", I may move it in.  But I also leave many tasks loose.  In this approach:<br><br>- Recurring tasks are in with a project, not in a Recurring list.  <br>- Unfinished tasks are in Active projects.<br>- New stuff is generally on a New page.<br>- There is no Old (that's an AF4 concept).  <br>- When I finish current tasks in a project, I send the project to an Inactive Projects section.<br><br>I run SAF over New and Active pages together, and my own system to reactivate inactive tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 December 2010 at 18:53 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Alan <br>I tried this approach and really it was a disaster for me.  <br>So I gona talk about projects. <br><br>finally I found another way for my MIP (most important project). I realised I could take a binder and put in it my most important handwriting projects. <br>The way I manage these project is simple. There are none details but only my big rocks. I can draw them in a square,  a euristic scheme,  5 or 6 word or sometime or make a simple sentence. <br><br>For the moment I have only a  few project pages. (now 4)<br><br>On another hand, Many project need an historical reporting. I just opened a word sheet (oup sorry a page sheet (i am on mac) or a text edit page, put it apart in my Mac's folder and do my historical reporting like this :<br>2010-11-09 I sent this to client X<br>2010-11-10 I did this and that <br><br>So, <br>I keep AF4R for working on the active and actionable tasks<br>And added a page where there is a handwriting UNFINISHED project page <br>I noticed that I just put the bigs Rock of it such as<br>Project X / DO THIS/ DO THAT/ THEN THAT/ THEN THIS/ AND END WITH THAT<br>When something is new eg Project X DO THAT it goes on my NEW PAGE with the others tasks until I do it and of course DO THIS on my unfinished project page is crossed. <br><br>With this method i realized i could follow many projects very easily and have my project page in its binder apart, only for what is absolutely necessary. <br><br>But I admit that if your project tasking works for you it's great for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 December 2010 at 21:50 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for sharing , Jupiter. To be honest I am not yet sure it's working great for me either :-) <br>But it's definitely fun and certainly not a disaster although I can easily see how it may be so. It's my system so I know how I use it and how I want it to behave and I'm constantly mindful of ways it can misbehave. <br><br>That said, what you have for projects looks great, likely even better than my approach, but for me now, would not be as fun :-)<br><br>(PS. It's not all about fun and games. I'm also getting important work done too.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 December 2010 at 1:21 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I wrote:<br>&lt;&lt;When I finish current tasks in a project, I send the project to an Inactive Projects section.&gt;&gt;<br>It turns out that moving projects is tedious in paper (though not in OneNote) and finding projects later is a chore when they are scattered. So I resolved instead to have a list of unfinished tasks, a list of projects with no current tasks, and to divide this list ala Af4.
