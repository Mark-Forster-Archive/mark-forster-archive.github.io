At first I was thinking I should use Mark's method for just pushing all the dates back whenever I miss a day, so my DWM book would be reset to the point before I got sick.<br><br>But as I was thinking about this, I realized that I actually do need to account for my sick time differently.  It's part of my life, something I need to live with (till I find a resolution for it, at least).   So, if I can't accomplish my work and something "tumbles over Niagara Falls" because I missed a couple days due to illness, my current thinking is that I should just let it fall.  <br><br>This will motivate me even further to make sure I stay on top of my list and don't take on more than I can really handle.  If I find that stuff is getting missed because I'm sick, then it's another sign I have too many commitments, more than I can handle right now.<br><br>This got me thinking even more broadly, in terms of vacations and other planned time off-list.  Instead of resetting the dates, maybe it's actually better to make sure you clear your list!   You know, clear the decks to make sure you are really ready to take a vacation.  <br><br>You always have the option of looking at the items that expired during your absence, and deciding what really needs to be done with them.  <br><br>This approach also has the advantage that you never need to rewrite the calendar dates.  This allows you to use the same book for appointments and for DWM, as some of you are doing.<br><br>Anyway, I am going to try this alternative approach and see how it goes.  <br><br>Let me know what you think!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2010 at 23:47 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Makes sense to me, Seraphim.  One tiny thought: One reason for 30 days besides being easy to find the proper date on the calendar is to allow ample time for that day to arrive so you can have all your tasks well considered.  Likewise for the 7 day interval.  If your times off the list are few you can manage as you say.  If they are slightly more frequent, you just might want to extend your time, although it makes finding the right date harder. Eg. push your active tasks to 10 days or 14 days out instead of 7.  Put your inactive tasks at 45 days.  <br><br>Or, just make sure you have fewer tasks on your list and try to always keep a couple days ahead.  Then if you need to miss a couple days you will only have a very few tasks to reschedule, and not your entire calendar.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2010 at 0:31 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So far, I really like this approach.  I wasn't able to work my list for a day, but that's OK because I have been making sure that I always keep the first few days on my list free from the threat of expiration.  That way, if I am forced away from my list by something for a bit, it won't trigger any expirations or page-renumbering or anything.  <br><br>It reduces the uncertainty, too.  I can feel more certain that I'll stay on top of my work even if something comes along that knocks me off-list, which inevitably happens with me with some regularity.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2010 at 23:53 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It happened to me too (through illness) - and actually I really like this approach. It 'keeps me honest' in that I know that dismissal *will* happen if I don't do something. Also, even when I was ill, I found I knew what was about to drop over the edge, and I got comfortable with that. If I thought I had some 'comeback' via. re-numbering pages etc. then maybe I wouldn't have been so aware of what was being dismissed.<br><br>In the (touch wood, unlikely) event of being ill for a longer period, the automatic dismissal would ensure that the remaining tasks were 1) limited, and 2) fresh (being generally the most recently added). And in the case where I was out/away for &gt; 1 month, I'm effectively starting again, which is probably sensible anyway.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 February 2010 at 12:38 | Ed C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Beware: If you missed a few days and don't renumber, only a handful of tasks fell off the end, but a hundred more crept up on you.  Your burden has gone up.  Be prepared to drop some more tasks soon.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 February 2010 at 21:07 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan - Yes, exactly!  But just because I got sick, or just because I decided to take a few days off, doesn't mean my workload has become any smaller.  <br><br>While I've been away, the rest of the world has continued along its way, filling my inbox with more paper and more emails.  And my deadlines have not been pushed back -- they really have moved closer.  Re-dating the pages masks this and makes it seem like everything is just the way I left it.  But really, it's not (unless all your deadlines are self-imposed and you are the only one who puts stuff in your inbox!).  :-)<br><br>By refusing to re-date my pages, I can more effectively manage my workload ***while taking into account*** the fact that I might need to miss days unexpectedly from time to time.<br><br>If you rarely have unplanned missed days, it's probably not an issue and re-dating may be effective.  But for me, I need to EXPECT unplanned missed days and STILL be able to handle the workload.  <br><br>Re-dating the pages gives me an excuse for continuing to be over-committed when my real life circumstances are really telling me to manage those commitments better.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 February 2010 at 22:27 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>I have been thinking precisely along the same lines.<br><br>What we are looking for is a _sustainable_ workload for ourselves.  That means we cannot pretend we are angels (or demons) with respect to what we can accomplish in any given 30-day period.  We must deal with reality, and in reality, every month we all have days where we don't get anything done.<br><br>Why should vacations get a free pass?  Why not start re-dating pages when you get many interruptions during your day?  Or if your child is sick?  Or if you feel sleepy?<br><br>Ultimately, I am responsible for accomplishing a month's-worth of work in a month.  If I can't, then I want my system to present me with hard choices _now_, so I can correct them now and get on with my life.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2010 at 12:08 | Dan P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very Nice, Dan,<br><br>That is EXACTLY the whole point of the system ... ANY system.  Life happens.  The system has to work to help us manage our lives ... not a well chosen abstraction of it.<br><br>I'm busily slogging ;-) through Mark's book and he makes that point very well there.  What we want is not so much a time management system but a life management system.<br><br>That said ... I do think that we have to consider HOW we react to the kinds of things we have to deal with:<br><br>- A vacation is planned so it does not make sense to schedule tasks in that window.<br><br>- Unexpected interruptions of our schedule can not be planned, but our system should have enough slack in it to cope with "typical" things that come out of left field.<br><br>There seems to be a lot of confusion about what to do with tasks that expire because of ... and that is part of the problem.  It probably all depends on WHY they expired as well as how important we think they are.<br><br>I'm assuming that Mark will address that in more detail later.  Barring that, I assume that most of us will decide on our own procedures.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2010 at 13:35 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim, praying you will be headache-free soon.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2010 at 22:53 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim, Ed C, Mike, Dan - <br><br>Yes, I think you're right about how to handle (planned &amp; unplanned) off-list dates.

Actually that's why I use a notebook without dates and three coloured post-its (red is the very first active page, to be dismissed tomorrow; yellow is at +6 pages - weekend is one unit for me - and red is at +24 pages. Everyday all post-its move one page forward. If a task has a deadline I write it left of the check-box and highlight it. <br><br>If I'll go on vacation I will leave the post-its where they are.Tasks with due-dates during vacation-time have to be tackled before the vacation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2010 at 11:17 | Christian G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's an interesting notion, doing it with undated pages. It certainly simplifies the question of "missed days"--by eliminating the whole concept of an actual day!
