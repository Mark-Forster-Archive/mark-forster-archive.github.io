Given that I'm only on day 2 of this experiment, I anticipate a relapse and frantic search for a dose of productivity promise and salvation. In the meantime, I'm excited. <br><br>I'm back to using an abridged version of DWM... in my case, all tasks are automatically provided a due date of 7 days. If don't make any progress on said task, it's removed from my system. <br><br>I'm also putting Barbara Sher's wisdom (Isolation is the dream killer) into practice by working with an accountability partner as well as taking part in this: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rightbrainbusinessplan.com/courses/fall2013/">http://www.rightbrainbusinessplan.com/courses/fall2013/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 September 2013 at 16:51 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A tool totally can drive your process. A program such as LifeBalance or MyLifeOrganzed for example drives you to a system that Categorizes and organizes everything so that it can feed you choices on what to do. Without that tool, you wouldn't and couldn't effectively implement that process.  More generally, tool features alter the balance among what things are easy, efficient or hard, and so if you dont adjust your process you aren't using your tools effectively.<br><br>Only be on guard as what's efficient in your tool might not match what's most effective for your life.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 September 2013 at 18:31 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't think it is sustainable to use a single app to govern one's life.

The big datebook I loved in school, when I carried the backpack everywhere, was impractical when I took two preschoolers to the doctor and needed to make follow-up appointments. Mom runs their business accounting on Excel, but if they shipped more than a few products a month they'd need something fancier. Most of our health notes go in a thin folder. When my daughter was very sick two years ago with a rare condition, we went to a big binder, just for her. (That binder is now in a box, and she's back to a thin file.)<br><br>Sometimes trying a different system gives insight into what's not working with the first. Sometimes it's a simple as a different definition for "roles" or "project".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 September 2013 at 18:12 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim<br><br>&lt;&lt;I don't think it is sustainable to use a single app to govern one's life. Life is too dynamic.<br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Believe it or not, many people govern their lives without any stated productivity systems or tools. My wife manages her role as a psychiatrist, researcher and mother with a to-do list **. <br><br>So far so good on the Daylite front.<br><br>** more often than not she manages everything in her head. I have another friend who runs a very successful New Media company in Montreal. He manages all of his tasks and projects using Omnifocus. Though he claims he doesn't have any set rules, and only uses the bare min of features.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 September 2013 at 18:17 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum - I think we are in violent agreement here, in regard to the approach adopted by our wives and most of the general public.  :-)<br><br>But I'm having a strong reaction against the idea of using any tool or system or algorithm as the main means to organize one's life.<br><br>I am coming to believe that managing things in one's head, with an ad-hoc list if needed, is probably the easiest and most effective "life management tool".<br><br>Supporting systems and tools are great.   But life is just too dynamic to use a single system, tool, or app to manage the integrated whole.   They may fill a gap, temporarily.   They may help a person get organized.   But their usefulness eventually runs out.<br><br>I think all of Mark's systems have a "common sense override".   In other words, there is some aspect of our life that is difficult to clearly articulate, when we "just know" what is important or "just know" the right decision.   We don't know how to fully explain it, so we call it "common sense".   It's difficult to build a data model around that kind of thing - thus it's difficult for any TM "system" or "tool" to even begin to address it.<br><br>I think this is a key to why so few people (perhaps nobody) sticks to a system permanently, finding that it addresses all their needs.   Ultimately, the internal rules of the system will come into more and more conflict with your common sense.   Mark exploited this idea with SMEMA.  Perhaps we should just basically assume that our common sense knows best, though it may need some help keeping track of all the details.  <br><br>This leads to the conclusion that the best "system" isn't a system at all, but simply becoming engaged with one's life and work in a deeper, more focused, and more conscious way.  <br><br>I think the "Drucker Effective Executive approach" is built on this idea:  Use whatever supporting systems you need to manage your calendar, your inbox, project details, etc.; and carve out time so you can spend most of your attention and worry on figuring out your #1 top priority focus where you can make the biggest impact, and focus on THAT.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 September 2013 at 20:36 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi avrum i can understand that you love daylite I did too but sadly it ruined my business., one time it crashed and all the work i did vanished definitivly.
