As part of that scan I kept my eyes open for ones that would be well suited to doing AF2 the why they are written today. Here's the list of those that survived out of 70 we looked at.<br><br>1) Toodeldo  (can be customize to only use status, tar, repeat) and is then perfectly suitable for autofocus. Plus has web application for desktop<br><br>2) WhatNext. (fi you stay off the flash card screen, it's pretty much autofocus) no desktop application<br><br>3) Smart Todo (very basic, you'd have to delete to dismiss) no desktop application<br><br>4) Zenbe nice basic lists with a web application<br><br>5) CarbonFin outliner. mention in other discussions. no desktop application.<br><br>runners up...<br><br>6) Crossout - almost perfect but buggy in OS 3.0<br><br>7) TaskPro - overly complex but can do it. no desktop<br><br>8) Listomni - some like it; feels too kitchen sync to me.<br><br>9) Omnifocus - can manage AF2 but many many more features than needed and high priced; if you need the power it's probably got it. <br><br><br>So if you need a desktop access look at:<br><br>Toodeldo, Zenbe, and OmniFocus.<br><br>If you don't need desktop also look at<br><br>WhatNext, Smart Todo and carbonfin.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 2:28 | ratz</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting! I haven't reviewed 70, but way too many. LOL I can't get Toodledo to work for AF2 at all. The tasks are in order on the desktop, but get scrambled on the iPhone even using the sort by date added feature. I tried for way too let to get it to work! If you repeat tasks, the new task gets added right next to the one you just completed rather than at the top/bottom of the list as you need it. Unlike Listomni, you either have to use repeat or have to type out the entire task to add it to your list again. I am thrilled with Listomni, however.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 5:07 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the list. Will check these out.<br><br>Mike</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 14:33 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just thought I would point out that Task Pro does sync with Toodledo. It just doesn't sync with subtasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 18:11 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've also not tested all 70 apps, but I do find Listomni to be ideal for Autofocus 2. It took a while to learn how to tweak it to make it work, but I find it works great once I learned the program. After using it a few days, I could not see me going back to pen and paper.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 0:41 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So note that this means that if you want to be able to work your AF2 list from both your iPhone and your laptop/desktop computer (with syncing, of course), and don't want to be restricted to a web-based app, Omnifocus is your only choice (at the moment, anyway). If only the developers of Things would introduce the option to disable automatic logging on the iPhone....</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2009 at 3:30 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As I mentioned in another thread, I'm finding OmniFocus on the desktop and the iPhone to be a very suitable AF2 'notebook'.<br><br>Given that the notion of the 'page' is gone in AF2, OF now works really well, although I'm only using a subset of the available features therein. But having desktop &lt;=&gt; iPhone sync is where it's at for me.<br><br>I'm also using OF for my someday/maybe list, my errands list and a current project list. With Perspectives and shortcuts, I can view my whole list (active, complete and dismissed) in toto, just active tasks relative to the dismissal 'line' and also just dismissed tasks as part of a review process.<br><br>It's a winner for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2009 at 10:00 | bongoman</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Chris so glad you are enjoying Listomni. I discovered a new delightful feature. If you add a book to your book list to buy, you tap the arrow next to it and are taken directly to Amazon or Google to purchase. Now if only I could tap my tasks and someone else would do them. Lol</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2009 at 16:22 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi again bongoman,<br><br>I've just put in some more serious time to playing with Omnifocus, and reading your posts on that other thread has been very helpful – thanks. I'm definitely seeing the appeal. I've been setting things up more or less the way you seem to, except that my two perspectives (one for a working list which just shows available items, and one that shows everything) are both in project view – that way I can add new items directly into the window and they get added to the bottom, and I can also use the various keyboard shortcuts for moving items around (particularly useful when I haven't finished a task, so I want to make a copy and put the new copy at the bottom of the list).<br><br>Anyway, after exploring for a few hours (!), I have a few unanswered questions, and thought of you, as AF2-in-Omnifocus guru.<br><br>(1) Am I right in thinking that there's no way of assigning an action more than one context in OF (at the top level of the hierarchy of contexts – not, that is by assigning a "subcontext")? And that there's no other way of tagging items? <br><br>(2) Do you "work your list" on the iPhone much? I'm thinking in particular of adding items, switching between perspectives (assuming you can set those up on the iPhone), dismissing, and so on. I ask because something you say on the other thread made me wonder whether you just look at your Errands list on the iPhone when you're out and about, or maybe look at it and cross things off. (I'm obviously just looking for reassurance that more extensive working of the list goes nicely on the iPhone, too.) <br><br>(3) One feature of Things I really like is the way it deals with tasks with future start dates. They're all contained on a "Scheduled" page, and laid out in a nice way: tasks for later this week, then a "Next week" section, then "July" (for tasks later in July than next week), "August", "September", etc., and then "2010", "2011", etc. (e.g. reminders to renew passports and driving licences when they expire). Then there are also sections for recurring tasks: "Every week", "Every month", "Every 29 days" (if you happen to set up a task with that frequency), etc. (Then, if you select the appopriate option, the task (or a copy, if it's a recurring task) just pops up in the "Today" window on the right date; so at the beginning of the day, I move anything that's shown up in "Today" to the end of my AF2 list. This is for tasks that I can't turn to before the relevant date, incidentally; I let AF2 make sure that I get it done on time, if that's an issue.)<br><br>So anyway, as far as I can tell, Omnifocus is at a bit of a disadvantage here. The obvious way of dealing with such tasks in OF (it seems to me, novice that I am) is just to put such actions in the main AF2 list. This is fine once you're in a view which shows only "available" actions (as is the case with my "working list" perspective), as they'll all be hidden, which is what I want most of the time. And I can then see those tasks by switching to my "everything" perspective. The problem, though, is that in that perspective, those tasks just to appear in the order in which they were *entered*, in amongst available, completed, and dismissed actions. So in the sample I've set up, I have an action scheduled for 2012 appearing in the midst of actions I completed today, actions that are live options right now, etc. This doesn't matter for regular working of the list, of course, as I can just switch perspectives, but it means I can't get a nice, easy to read overview of what I've scheduled for the future, and when.<br><br>Or am I missing something? <br><br>Thanks (if I can say that without presuming that you'll be able to respond).<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 July 2009 at 4:29 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Whoops...of course, within five minutes of posting that long third question, I figured out how to do it (group actions by start date in the contexts view, and collapse the "Start Any Time" list if I just want to see items with a future start date).<br><br>It would still be nice if I could screen out the future-start-date items from my "everything" view – or, to be more precise, if I could choose to see completed items and available items, but without future start date items. Is there a way to do that? (As far as I can see, no: Context view won't let you see both available items and completed items, because you can't see both remaining and completed together; and in Project view, you can see both available and completed, but only by choosing "Any status", which then also gives you the unavailable future-start-date items.)<br><br>Anyway, this almost solves the problem behind question (3). Question (2) was most important, as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>Thanks again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 July 2009 at 4:52 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another follow-up:<br><br>I've now figured out a way of solving the residual problem described in the post just above. (I've created a "Scheduled" project, and I'm putting actions with future start dates in there. Then they don't show up on my "everything" view, because that's just an "everything in the Autofocus" project view really – completed and available – but I can still view future-start-date items in the nicely chronological way by setting up an appropriate perspective. I figured this out because I was trying to solve another problem: if I just assign future-start-date items to the AF project, then when they become available they appear in the middle of my AF list –  reflecting, as far as I can tell, their creation dates and times, rather than the point at which they became available.)<br><br>So anyway, that solves problem (3) and its descendants altogether. And it's not so important what the answer to (1) is, as there are certainly workarounds that do the jobs I need doing. So that leaves (2), which is the biggie...maybe I'll just splash out on the iPhone app for a test run, and if I end up not being happy, at least I don't have to buy the desktop version.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 July 2009 at 5:31 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s. I'm assigning every item in the Scheduled project a due date – the same date as its start date – so then when something becomes "ready" in Scheduled, I'll see an icon in the sidebar. I can then just drag those items (if any) from Scheduled into Autofocus at the beginning of each day, just as I did in Things. (I'm switching off all the other alerts – special font colours, etc. – so that the items in question can just blend right in on the AF list when I move them over.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 July 2009 at 5:34 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been using Things (a Mac desktop + iphone app)  for a while and like it a lot. I stumbled on Mark's autofocus system yesterday only and am eager to try v2 of it.<br><br>I wondered if I could use this system along with Things, and seems the app will easily adapt:<br><br>- I will live in the Today screen, which will be the AF2 list.<br><br>- new items will get entered there, from top to bottom...<br><br>- ... unless I enter them only for future reference, someday projects, etc, in which case they will be put in their own context/project list.<br><br>- item that has been actioned but needs to be acted upon again can be duplicated, so one instance is crossed off and the other is moved back at the top of the list.<br><br>- crossed off items can be set to remain there indefinitely. <br><br>- I will create a dummy task with "--------------------" to act as a separator for potentially dismissed items. I then simply move that line at the beginning of the day.<br><br>- All unactioned items that fall beneath this line will be removed the next day by selecting them, marking them as "not Today" and adding to them a "dismissed" tag. That way they will be removed from view and sent back to their own context/project list, if any, or in the "Next action" list if they aren't attached to any context or project. It will then be easy to eventually review them. Since they will bear the "dismissed" tag, it'll be easy to differentiate them from other tasks/ideas that haven't been dismissed yet.<br><br>- If I want, I can add to any new action a context-sensitve tag -- so that if I'm going through the list at the office, I can choose to remove from view all those that were tagged as "errands" for example.<br><br>- I can also use Project lists and Areas list (like Personal, Work, Family, etc) whenever I want to brainstorm/plan/envision... and then browse through these lists once in a while, and mark either a whole project as "Today" -- in which case the first item in this project will be put in my AF2 list -- or a simple task.<br><br>All in all, that seems an elegant and simple way to start testing AF2 for myself. What do you think? Any drawback to using an app like Things?<br><br>Yan</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 July 2009 at 20:26 | Yan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Yan,<br><br>See my first post on this thread:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/818439">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/818439</a><br><br>for the reason AF2 can't be implemented on the Things iPhone app, or on the iPhone + desk/laptop. (Desk/laptop alone would be fine, as then you could simply switch off automatic logging, which is what causes the problem.) The relevant post is dated June 29, 2009 at 4:09 p.m.<br><br>I've corresponded with Cultured Code about this, and they currently have no plans to change the logging options on the iPhone app. As a result, I've just completed a defection to Omnifocus, with some (melodramatic) sorrow. It's a shame – I still love the look of Things, and it handles recurring tasks much more nicely than either Omnifocus or The Hit List (the other one I spent the most time looking at). But for me it's important to be able to use both laptop and iPhone, and not to be tied to an internet connection to access my list.<br><br>Thanks, incidentally, to bongoman for explaining the virtues of Omnifocus (which are many) on here.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 July 2009 at 23:34 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Martin,<br><br>Thanks for explaining this... I found that thread shortly after writing my post.<br><br>Here's a workable solution to this auto-logging problem:<br><br>I have a dummy task labeled "--------------------------" that acts as a divider, to separate the last block of unactioned items at the beginning of each day and marking them as "soon-to-be-dismissed".<br><br>Now I just have to duplicate a few times this divider task, and at the end of each workday I slide an instance of the divider between blocks of items (every place where there are completed items actually).<br><br>Which means that I now have several dividers, and only the last one indicates the tasks that will be dismissed the next day.<br><br>This should work fine. Having the completed items purged from the list every day and replaced with a simple divider line will in fact make the list more compact, easier to read, and thus more enjoyable to spend time with :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 July 2009 at 4:23 | Yan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Yan,<br><br>I thought of that, and the reason I decided not to do it is that after working with an AF2 list for a while, I'd up with huge numbers of those divider lines spread throughout the list. This will make for a lot more flipping between "pages" (projects, e.g.), or a lot more scrolling if you do everything in the Today list. (I've just looked at my list to confirm that that's how it would have gone.) Of course, you could get around that by addiing a further epicycle at the end of each workday: remove all the divider lines that are now unnecessary (thanks to today's completions). But this just struck me as too tedious to be worth it, given that there are electronic solutions which make both steps (the addition of extra dividers, and the removal of redundant ones) entirely unnecessary. But maybe (either way) it wouldn't be as much of a pain as I imagined, and/or would be worth it given the advantages of Things.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 July 2009 at 14:50 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Corrigenda:<br><br>line 2: "I'd *end* up with huge numbers..."<br>middle: "addiing" --&gt; "adding"<br>line -2: by "either way", I meant whether you (a) just add extra dividers alone, or (b) do that *and* remove redundant dividers at the end of each day.<br><br>Not enough sleep last night....</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 July 2009 at 14:54 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'll give it a try and report how it goes.
