LOL<br><br>Jacqueline, just had to share a funny with you. I told my girlfriend (who I turned on to BFL) about slow burn weight training. She called me from the gym this morning freaking out. She was counting to 25 while lifting the weight and 25 while lowering. ROTFL That would make for a very intense workout. I had just read the Power of Ten (he advocates 10 up and 10 down when the range of motion allows it), so set her straight. I am really excited about the amount of time that will be freed up as I use this approach. I did the Power of Ten workout last night and was so surprised by how long after working out my legs were still shaking! The concept just makes so much sense. Now why didn't you tell me about it a long time ago? LOL<br><br>Mike, I'm so glad to hear you've benefited from a low-carb diet as I have. As a contrarian, I know you will appreciate how much I wanted to scream as I lead a weight loss group for a friend who was out of town. She had a just-graduated nutritionist tell everyone in the group to have one little serving of meat, one tsp. of fat a day and the rest carbs and veggies!!!!! AAGHGHGGH! I told my dh I was going back to school to become a RD to fight this nonsense. LOL He didn't think that was a great idea. LOL <br><br>The research I have done on this has absolutely stunned me. My next endeavor will be making my own soaked, sprouted, and fermented baked goods. Most of the sugar is predigested as is gluten from this process. I was freaking out about finding time to do this, but reducing my time at the gym will help a bunch! As will the new-found energy and health I have as I've eliminated the carbs. The "healthy" carbs were even killing me because I ate so many (orange juice/fruit smoothie every morning), fruit and high carb veggies at every meal. <br><br>I just read reviews for a book that has a premise I think your average Joe and Jane could grasp better than most other diet books. It's the No S Diet Book I believe. The concept is you cannot have snacks, sugar, or seconds except on Saturdays, Sundays, or special occasions. Those who are not battling illness as I have may be more comfortable with this type of approach. Of course, one would hope that they would feel so bad overdoing any sweets on the S days that they would limit them then, too.<br><br>So how does low-carb dieting relate to time-management? The more sugar we eat, the more we want to eat--even (and maybe especially) if we eat "diet" sweets. When I eat sufficient amounts of protein and healthy fat, I am not constantly hungry. Therefore, I don't spend all my time eating!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 July 2009 at 17:26 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel, you crafty devil!  :-)<br><br>Here's an article on the Power of 10.  I recall reading it a few years ago, but STILL didn't do it!   <br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/11/20/48hours/main584762.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/11/20/48hours/main584762.shtml</a><br><br>Here's an excerpt from the article on the identical twins that followed either Power of 10 or cardio.  I'd be curious about the BF decrease, since the Power of 10 girl s/have put on a couple of pounds of muscle and the cardio only probably lost a couple of pounds of muscle:<br><br>After five weeks, the experiment is over. <br><br>Kelli has lost a total of 15 pounds and 8 inches across her chest, waist and thighs. Vanessa, who did the cardio workout, lost only 4 pounds and 4 inches. “I was literally putting in 5 hours a week. She was putting in 20 minutes,” says Vanessa. “And she did more than 30 times more weight loss than I had, so the proof's in the pudding.” <br><br>All I know is that I'm seeing the insertion points in my calves again (and I never train calves directly) and my shoulders and arms are getting hard.  :-)<br><br>Mark followed the "no S diet" for quite a while in the past.  If you search on his blog, you can find references to it.  <br><br>I think one of the keys to dieting is finding a system that you can naturally follow that keeps your weight down without taking all the time to count every calorie, fill out logs and all that maintenance.   What worked the best for me earlier this year is not eating anything until about 2 p.m., then eating quite a large meal, then not eating again except for a small snack when I get home.  The hard part of this is the "must eat with the kids" mentality and the indocrination I had with "must consume protein regularly throughout the day to maintain muscle mass - eat 6 times a day mentality".)  Multiple opportunities to eat = multiple opportunities to overeat for me. And not having to prepare meals all the time is a HUGE time savings!!!<br><br>Here's an interview with Mike Eades (Protein Power)<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/03/02/postponing-death-caloric-restriction-vs-intermittent-fasting-part-1/">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/03/02/postponing-death-caloric-restriction-vs-intermittent-fasting-part-1/</a><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 July 2009 at 19:42 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline, you are just a paragon of information! At the time this was hot, I had my fourth baby. I guess I was too busy to keep up with fitness trends. LOL Actually, I'd heard to lift slowly, but that was it. I blew it off. LOL <br><br>As for the fasting. Jordin Rubin of the Maker's Diet recommends partial fasts once or twice a week (can't remember which). I feel better when I do a partial fast, but I can't sustain them. I am in need of calories at the moment. I wonder if anyone has studied less frequent fasts? I remember seeing  a news piece on calorie restriction and they showed this emaciated older couple who ate like birds to live longer. I'd rather cut my time a little shorter thank you very much. lol</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 July 2009 at 22:23 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel, I think something like the warrior diet or www.fast-5.com gives some of the benefits of fasting without the deprivation or the low calories since you are eating every day, it's just in a window of time.   Brad Pilon wrote "Eat Stop Eat" and recommends 1 day fasts once or twice a week.  I know Roy Walford's (he was the science guru of calorie restriction) daughter Lisa has a BMI of 15.  Maybe she's healthy, but she looks anorexic.  Walford himself wasn't so skinny and looked pretty good for his age.  He fasted one day a week.<br><br>My father is 89 y.o., takes no medication of any kind, has no health problems, never been in the hospital outside of when in the army during WWII and a bad shoulder from being gored by a bull.  No memory loss, no hearing loss and still works on my brother's ranch for 15 hour days every spring and fall.  He quit smoking 20 years ago when my mother died, but had smoked for over 50 years prior to that.  The one thing that he has done differently than his brothers and sisters who have had some of the longevity but not the excellent health, has been to eat lower carb naturally (he doesn't like sugar/baked goods so has them rarely - I wish he'd passed on THAT gene!!) and organically and to not allow himself to become inactive.  I still remember him eating the fat off our plates - with that saying - "that's the best part" when we'd have roast beef or buttering bread with gobs of lard. Ugh!<br><br>There's always such conflicting science and anecdotal evidence of people doing well on programs that it's hard to know what to do.  I think the method I'm following now of training every morning very intensely, heavy and slowly and doing my sports and biking and walking that I enjoy as my natural happy pill works.  And with the diet, just eating cleaner (w/o deprivation) and getting back to a fast-5 kind of protocol will work.  Nothing extreme, nothing that sucks time - in fact, should actually save time given that I have more energy following this method of eating and exercising.  <br><br>Now if I could just get my animals to stop intermittently meowing or barking at 4 a.m., I'd be content...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 0:01 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline,<br><br>I read, a couple of days ago, that the world's oldest man just died ... at 113.  Asked his secret he said: "Smoking, drinking whiskey, and wild, wild women."  ;-)<br><br>I think all of this is mostly genetic.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 0:07 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, we hear of these stories, but I think we do because they're anomalies. Genetics can help you overcome poor self-care, but it seems that happens less and less these days. The average breast cancer age keeps dropping. The number of autoimmune disorders keeps rising. Why is that? It's too quick for it to be a genetic change. <br><br>Jacqueline, I think diet and exercise are very much like time management: you have to find what works for you. However, I do think many people think their diet and lack of exercise "works" when in fact it is contributing to their poor health. I'm excited to start a tennis league in the fall. Can't remember the last time I engaged in truly recreational exercise!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 0:27 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, I think there's a certain genetic component to it, he's fortunate enough to have abnormally high HDL cholestrol (I did get that, thank goodness!) - however my uncles and aunts all come from the same genetic material as my father - and none are remotely close to as healthy - and none lived on a farm with an extremely healthy natural diet and a lot of hard work their entire lives.  There's only 7 of them, so it's not like it's a statistically valid sample size, but a couple passed away in their early 80's and a couple have a touch of Alzheimers.  That's what led to my interest in caloric restriction, as it's supposed to be good for the brain.  I can handle getting a bit weaker, but the mental deterioration I couldn't stand.<br><br>In the research on supercentarians, it seems to show that one thing they all do is not let stress get to them.  That's why I don't let things get *urgent*... :-)<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 2:14 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have what I call a '2 line' diet:<br><br>Eat reasonable portions of healthy food at regular mealtimes.<br>Eat in order to feel hungry for an hour before the next meal.<br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 11:48 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Smileypete, #2 sounds like "hari hachi bu" from the Okinawans - eat until you're 80% full.  My only problem is that I will mindlessly snack and if I eat anything in the morning, especially higher carb, I am ravenous at lunch time and will snack in the afternoon too.  And feel draggy during the afternoon.  If I don't eat in the morning, I'm not hungry until around 1 p.m. and by then I'm busy and don't get around to eating until 2 p.m.  Yet after that meal, I don't feel tired in the afternoon.  And I'm not hungry when I get home, so I make better food choices for supper.<br><br>Mel and Mike, I think that claiming genetics can lead to not doing what you *can* do - not to necessarily live longer maybe, but to have a better quality of life along the way.  I don't care if I make it to 100, but I'd like to hit 90 in full possession of my faculties and be as physically fit as my father or the 90 year old I met going up the gondola skiing this winter who still does double black diamonds.  <br><br>Or like this lady, who has since passed away, but I'd say she had a pretty good quality of life physically compared to most people her age:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAUQd1xfyPs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAUQd1xfyPs</a><br><br>Mel, I've moved away from doing pretty much any cardio exercise that isn't recreational in some way, whether that's downshill skiing (X-C w/dog too and this winter we tried snowshoeing with the dog) or skating in the winter and biking, hiking or walking with the dog in the summer - and now my 8 y.o. is keen to play racquetball, so there's something we can do together this winter.  We were at Glacier Park on our holidays and Sparky couldn't go on the trails (I didn't know this when we booked there or I would have gone to the Canadian side where they can hike) - so he got 3 hours of biking a day on the roads to keep him calm.  There's no pushing myself to do it at all, and I don't feel like it's wasted time either.  It's something that seems to add more to your life (socially &amp; with family) rather than taking away from being with other people.  Like you, I'm an extrovert and need that time with people.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 13:57 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline, I completely agree with you. And the body builder you've linked to is one of my heroines. :-) Like you, my goal isn't to live as long as possible but as well as possible. I now believe that weakness is not inevitable in old age. That prospect is exciting to me. I also love the idea of finding more social ways to include exercise in my life. I'm even excited about weight training with my kids. I can see the boys really pushing me. They're so naturally competitive that I think it will work well to encourage one another to reach new highs. My dh, on the other hand, is taking a while to make this shift. LOL He lives to go to the gym, so will struggle with this weight train twice a week thing. He never used to be a big cardio person except for recreationally, but I've created a monster with the 30 Day Shred approach. lol Now he wants to work out like a madman and I guess since he loves it, what's the harm? I honestly like it sometimes too. Great stress relief. <br><br>As for your carb problem, I've noticed that my need for them has dramtically improved since I've not been able to have them. I feel like I've gone through a serious withdrawal! On the other hand, I had a teaspoon of raw honey the other day and couldn't stop thinking about it. LOL Maybe after enough time has passed I'll be able to keep myself under control. I certainly enjoy not having the constant hunger and energy fluctuations I was experiencing before. <br><br>smileypete, if basic principles work for you in diet as they can in TM, that's wonderful. Unfortunately, I am the type that keeps stretching the definition to include my unhealthy habits. I need more structure than that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 16:20 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Finally - there's proof that when you exercise, it only makes you eat more.   It bugs me to think of how many hours of my life I wasted pushing myself to do exercise I didn't particularly enjoy when I should have just put the time into playing sports. :-(<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1914857-1,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1914857-1,00.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2009 at 19:30 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline, exercising more will increase your energy needs and may make you hungrier. But I don't think it's true that you automatically eat more junk. Whenever I've worked out, I find junk food really unappetizing. I think the more likely problem with obesity is fructose consumption (that is if other carbs are being controlled). Food allergies and intolerances are another major culprit. These responses set up an addictive cycle in the body and the body holds on to weight. Right now I can eat as much fat and protein as I want (and then some) and I will not gain weight. I haven't been working out either. But if I eat carbs that I am not able to absorb right now, I will gain weight. The number of people with digestive or digestive related disorders is epidemic. I think we've bashed people for so long for being lazy overeaters and unfortunately I don't think it's warranted in many cases. Yes, of course, binge eating will lead to weight gain, but what are they binging on? Meat? Don't think so.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2009 at 20:54 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm no nutritionist by any means, but it strikes me that thinking in simplified labels of carb, protein and fat foods is not a great starting point for basing a diet on. The value of proteins, fats and carbs and food consumption in general depends so much on the context. <br><br>With context I mean, the quality of the food (i.e. not all fats are the same), how you are eating it, when you are eating it, how much of it you are eating and in what combinations and last but not least, how are you feeling when eating and how well your digestive system functions (which is related to your general health and psychological well being).  <br><br>With nutrition I think in terms of maintaining optimum energy levels throughout the day. It helps to think in terms of how your digestive system best functions. <br><br>questions like the following in my view, are better starting points to addressing nutrition than attempting to find the perfect combination of nutrients according to some book or person. <br><br>are you eating while multitasking, standing up or sitting down, are you chewing it enough (since a huge part of the digestive process takes place in the mouth), when are you consuming? Just before bed? In what combinations are you eating foods? What's the quality of the food, is it processed or is it closer to its natural state that are easy to digest? Are you combining starches with fruits and meats? After you've eaten, do you do something to aid digestion, like walking? Are you eating things that take a long time to digest? Are you eating certains foods to turn a bad feeling in a good one? Are you eating just before going to bed when you're digestive system doesn't work at it's best? Are you eating portions larger than you can literally stomach? etc etc<br><br>Or to put it into two questions, before eating, ask how much your body has to work to digest what you are about to eat depending on your personal context and what nutritional value is it going to give you in return in relation to what you need depending on your personal context. I find those better questions than making choices based on the carb, protein and fat values.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2009 at 21:49 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b">http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b</a><br><br>Eat food.<br>Not too much.<br>Mostly plants.<br><br>:)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2009 at 22:15 | Sabrina</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Peter, I agree but not with the food combining stuff.

The following book excerpt for example discusses the effect of eating proteins in combination with starches.

Whenever I watch american television, which comes with a ton of commercials than in comparison to BBC etc, I notice getting quite the appetite for pizzas, burgers etc. It seems they jam those types of commercials in your face half the time.

That's very important for me as I malabsorb them. My point is aside from choosing quality food, I don't like to over think how I eat them. That doesn't seem very natural or traditional to me, kwim? But I have read some of the theory behind it. I do get weary of all the disagreement about what we should be eating.

That's a full on strategy!  I'm more lax .....I simply cook in large batches and freeze.  With vegetables, when I'm physically able (I tend to cut myself), I'll fill a huge salad bowl with cut tomatoes, carrots and red peppers as a base.  Then for individual servings I'll hack off a portion of romaine, rinse it, and then tear it with my hands to prevent cutting myself.  I can add beans, nuts, cheese, etc and whip up my mood at the moment salad dressing.   Sometimes I'll simply bake a couple dozen chicken breasts plain and  later pull them out for recipes or salads and sandwhiches.  A GREAT cheat is store bought frozen spinich and brocolli.  They don't taste too far off from cooking fresh. I don't like frozen carrots nearly as well as fresh, but carrots are hard to slice with my pitiful hands.......When I have a window of opportunity, I'll cut carrots like mad, blanch them and freeze them...........but I don't get too many days where my hands are up to the task.<br>I only wish I was as ambitious as you with this!<br>My biggest cheat is store bought bread....can't knead very well(you'd be surprised how much your neck is involved with seemingly unrelated movement)  Here's where I suffer the most!  REAL bread is delicious and cheap to make. Plus, I love putting in more oatmeal, nuts, etc into the mix.  My workaround is ...........don't laugh too hard.........pressing seeds, nuts or and oatmeal into each slice before I build my sandwhich!  ROTFL!!!!!<br>learning as I go<br>p.s.

(little sensation in parts of my hands and fingers...that's also why cutting is VERY challenging!

LOL!  Same for dinnerware and glassware.  Even when I'm up to cooking elegant meals, they are served on corelle.  I used to save glass wine glasses for guests....but I cut myself washing them......It's either plastic or bring and wash your own!  ROTFL!

I'll have to read it when my focus is better...but at quick glance, it looks quite promising!

My rx since I don't eat bread very often (I rank bread with deserts and usually something chocolate will win out!  LOL)  I love that I can store bread in freezer and zap it for 12 seconds in the miracle nuker (microwave).  I even use it to soften bread, warm up veggies on the fly, etc.  But good can be evil as well.......it'll ruin meat awful!!!!!  <br>With Bev's idea, I could mass produce several loaves and freeze them.  Lots of days it isn't worth the neck pain to bend over putting stuff in and out of oven.
