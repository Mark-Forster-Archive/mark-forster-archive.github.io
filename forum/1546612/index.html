The authors and the loyal visitors will recognize the ideas but I don't have time to search through the forum to give the proper credit here.<br><br>1} Although I gained a lot of insight from Mark's systems. I was never able to use them according to the rules.  Particularly, I don't dismiss tasks, I don't work the list in order.  The list is just an extension of my memory.<br><br>2}  I like having Today's tasks in one place, but second notebook, lose pages, dedicated pages in main notebook were rather not satisfactory.<br><br>3} The main problem is that I like to have one notebook, but it needs to be rather small, usually A5, flat, so either Rollabind or spiral, as I like to see only one page, hate flipping the pages and have limited desk space.<br><br>4} I liked Mark's ideas of SF with two columns C1 and C2, but for me it was still too much flipping of pages and problems with having Today column only, that would be rather static.<br><br>5} I got more hopeful when, Alan i think, proposed using dated pages with C1-new and C2-active pages.  It was closer to my needs, but after trying it for about two weeks, I found it still lacking.  The main problem was that the C1 columns contained usually only few tasks but kept growing in numbers.  And I worked mostly C2-active column putting there not just the active tasks according to Alan's rules but all the "Today" tasks that needed to be done.  But the next day I didn't need this column, I had a new one for the new day.  So why not to get read of it.  But that was not possible when using both sides of the notebook or the diary.<br><br>6} Then someone, I don't remember who, proposed cutting the notebook pages to the half of the width. That was the Eureka moment for me.  But I still needed some practice to adapt this idea to what works for me and what doesn't.<br><br>7} My System:<br><br>__ A) I use a spiral bound notebook, folded, open on the first page.  So I use only one, right side of the notebook.<br><br>__ B) C1 column is used to enter all the new tasks, and can be worked anyway possible from AF1 to AF4, or can be used as the running master list of tasks.<br><br>__C) C2 column on the first page is used as a "Today" list.  It can have a date on the top, but at any given time there is only one Today list so even this is not necessary, unless you want to use it calendar/diary style and add some reminders at the future dates.<br><br>__D) At the end of the day, or morning the next day, the half of the page with the C2 column is cut away, living C1 column with the master list of tasks, and exposing the next full page on which the C2 column can be used for Today list independently of other pages.<br><br>__E)  Advantages to me are, seeing only one page of the notebook.  Always seeing column C2 with Today's tasks no matter where I can be on the C1 list.  The main master list can be flipped easily without moving the notebook and losing the view of Today's page. The place on the C1 list can be bookmarked if necessary. After each day I can get rid of Today's list and never see it again, without worrying about the continuity of the main C1 list.  At the end I will be left with the notebook half the width and only containing my master list.<br><br>__F)  Possible questions, disadvantages can be uneven use of number of pages.  Like many empty pages left in the half-width notebook, you can use it for some other notes after starting a new notebook.  Not enough lines for C2 column (C1 doesn't have a limit), you can use the other side of the half page that is going to be cut away tomorrow.  The left side of the page that is permanent, closer to the binding, can be used for C1 column if you don't mind working this way.<br><br>At first, I hesitated to write so much since both typing and English are not easy for me. But since my solution is a result of all that I read here, I decided that maybe someone may be at least inspired by my solution to find something that would work for him.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2011 at 18:30 | Ilse</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That sound really neat, Ilse.  Just one question: Usually things I work on today (C2) are not done gone forever, but you are chopping those things out and throwing away.  What happens to the unfinished and recurring?  Are you copying them forward to the next C2?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2011 at 18:48 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>Yes, if something is unfinished and I plan to work on it tomorrow, I copy it on the next C2 column.  If it can wait then it goes to the end of C1.  Same with recurring.  If it's every day then it goes to next C2, if it's not day dependent it goes to C1.<br><br>I usually read all C1 task at least once a day, but it can be at any time of the day so if something needs to be done today it has to be in my face at any given moment, hence the importance of seeing Today list no matter which C1 page is open currently.<br><br>Also, I like having Today list fresh every day, otherwise I start drifting not seeing even what was written before.  I have very short memory, always had, so anything out of sight is out of mind. Also I stop seeing anything that's even day old on my desk, unless I'm physically engaged with it.  If, I have to pick up or shuffle something I start seeing it as needing to be done.  Otherwise it can sit on the pile forever.  So I need reminders to look through things that can be important.  <br><br>On the other hand, I'm also a neat freak, once I start doing something, so a fresh Today list every single day, plus getting rid of the last's day list suits my weaknesses, and allows me to be at peace that the most important things are on exposed C2, but everything else I may need is in one continuous C1list.<br><br>I may eventually come with a system of checklists for recurring tasks, but so far I have failed many attempts, and anyway I need a reminder on Today list to check the checklists anyway.<br><br>I once saw, although didn't have time to implement, an idea to print recurring tasks on a small sticker, like mailing label (in some sort of shorthand, symbols or abbreviations) and just paste it on the Today list instead of writing it every day.  For instance, 8 small circles for 8 glasses of water to drink, 3-5 squares for meals, a triangle for vitamins and so on, according to needs and imagination.  I was trying to find a link to it recently, but failed so far.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2011 at 20:49 | Ilse</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have found an example of using stickers with daily checklists.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/clkl/399843731/in/photostream/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/clkl/399843731/in/photostream/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 July 2011 at 3:26 | Ilse</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+JMJ+<br><br>Ilse,<br><br>You are referring to DarrenM's post, right? <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1535216#item1539676">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1535216#item1539676</a><br><br>What is funny is that I misread that post and had always thought that he meant making a HORIZONTAL cut, not a vertical cut, along the pages of the notebook. Funny, eh? But the horizontal cut makes more sense to me than the vertical cut, because (1) it makes it easier to look at other pages of either half than the vertical cut; (2) it is easier to use the back page of either half, compared to using the back of the outer vertical column.<br><br>So think about it:<br><br>1) Make the bottom half C1 (because it would have more lines; dividing each of the pages of bottom half to two columns will give it enough lines for the pre-requisite 25-35 lines per page.  <br>2) Make the upper half C2, with each leaf (therefore two pages) dated, so that <br>__a) you can rip each page after the day is done<br>__b) there is more room to write (front + back pages), making a dated C2 more feasible.<br><br>Of course this is much less neater than the vertical cut.

You could say it is an SF-inspired dashboard, in a notebook form factor. There is only one column, but I split the pages vertically, with something similar to C2 at the top.<br><br>Writing it:<br>- Tasks you have not started ("New") go at the bottom of the page, working upward.<br>- Tasks you have started ("Active" or "Unfinished") go at the top of the page, working downward.<br>- When a page fills up, draw a heavy line between the New and Active regions, and keep entering tasks on the next (blank) page.<br>- Urgent tasks get no special treatment, but they are easy to find on your latest pages.<br>- Recurring tasks have no special place, and I tend to keep them on a separate checklist. You could write in a few of these, but too many would clutter up the display.<br><br>Working it:<br>- Work the pages and tasks in any order, but strive to keep a concise list of current activity on the latest page. Particularly, copy all active items to the latest page's Active section. When you've just started a new page, though, it is more convenient to treat the latest two pages as one unit.<br>- Making heavy SF-style dots helps you see what you're currently doing. Start as many tasks as you want, with as many heavy dots as you want. Rotate amongst them in a "little and often" free-for-all.<br>- Moving any task forward in any way is grounds for crossing it out and, if not completed, reentering it in the Active section of the open page. If it is already in that section of that page, there is no benefit to crossing it out. Just leave it with a heavy dot until you feel like working on it some more.<br>- Filing a task in a project folder or putting on a calendar or in a tickler file, etc. is a great way to get it crossed off the list. Just clarify when/how you next to be reminded of it, and then file it appropriately.<br>- When you finish something and want to "shop" for new things to work on, scan your backlog. "Activate" something by crossing it out in the backlog and copying it to your latest page. You probably haven't worked on it for a long time, so it would go in the "New" section.<br>- Strive to finish everything in "Active." Flip often through your latest pages to knock out their entire top ("Active") sections. I make a blue "X" through the entire top section when done.<br>- If you feel anxious about recent unfinished tasks, flip through the notebook whenever you want.<br><br><br>Special notations:<br>- Any bookmarks or symbols that help you feel on top of the backlog are great. I have stopped using my bookmarks, though. I seem to be most interested in closing out the very oldest of the backlog, and in closing out the more recent pages, which I've been very successful with.<br>- Write the month and year at the top of each page. Date numbers will end up on the page later as mentioned below.<br>- Leave a two-character left margin on every line (I imagine writing two capital O's). The first slot is for a date, and the second is for that heavy dot we like to make when starting work on an item.<br>- This part is visually obvious but hard to describe—if you try it once, it will be easy: At the beginning of each day, write the numeric date (not the month, just the date) in that first slot of the margin. I also make a little dash (like an "over-line") above the number, showing the date boundary visually. Both page regions need this number; in the bottom region, the little dash underlines the number instead. The two date numbers thus bracket today's entries vertically. Visually, the days converge from the edges of the page toward the middle.<br>- It helps me tremendously to see these dates as I flip through the notebook. They are a constant gauge of recency, staleness, etc., very useful objectively and subjectively.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 July 2011 at 6:29 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am using pretty much vanilla SF; urgent tasks going in C2 on the current page, unfinished tasks to C2 on the next page.  My definition of "finished" can be a little flexible - if I can't bear the thought of carrying over a task to C2 on the next page yet again I generally take it as a sign that I need to redefine it, so will regard it as "finished" and put an appropriate "next step" at the end of the list. <br><br>I think what has kept the system feeling fresh for me is that I am now using an ADOC notebook with removable pages.  This means that I can treat the list as circular, moving a page to the back of the list when I move off it.  I also use a sheet of squared paper (rather than lined) to indicate whether I am on the front or back side of the first page; this effectively serves as a place to jot down notes as I am working since it is always the facing page to the list page I am working on.  I don't bother with a marker for the end of the list - it is always easy enough to find because it is the only page with space at the end of C1, and I only have 8 active pages (4 sheets of paper) for my work list and ditto for my home list.  Both live in the same binder, separated by a divider.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 July 2011 at 23:28 | Richard Stamper</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The feel and flow of AF1 feels good.
