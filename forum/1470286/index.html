Here is what I do:<br><br>- When I dismiss a page, I enter a new task, "Review dismissed tasks on page XXX".<br><br>- Thus I end up getting these "Review dismissed tasks on page ..." peppered throughout my list.<br><br>- These "Review dismissed..." tasks often stand out.  The reviews are quick, fun, and often illuminating.<br><br><br>(I used to just have one task, "Review dismissed", meaning, "Review ALL your dismissed tasks."  This almost never stood out.  It seemed too daunting, too large.  I noticed in one discussion thread that someone was entering "Review dismissed on page XXX" and decided to try that approach, and have found it much more effective for me.  Reviews happen much more frequently, and dismissed items are handled much more quickly and effectively.)<br><br><br>- Here is how I actually handle the review:   Read through the dismissed items on that page fairly quickly.   Then go through and think about each more a little more carefully, and go with that "stand out" feeling for each one.<br><br>- If it "stands out", then I ask myself, "Is this one ready to be re-entered?   Why didn't it get actioned before?   Has anything changed to make it more likely to actually be actioned this time around?"   If I have satisfactory answers to those questions, then I re-enter the task.  Sometimes it gets re-phrased.  Sometimes it gets entered into my tickler, rather than into my SF list.<br><br>- If it DOESN'T stand out, then I ask myself, "Is this one ready to be deleted?"  If the idea of deletion makes me anxious for some reason -- any reason -- then I leave it there.  <br><br>- Sometimes I can clear a page completely with just one review.  But usually it takes 2 or 3 reviews to either re-enter each task or convince myself it's OK to delete them.<br><br><br>Wishing you a blessed Easter!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 April 2011 at 4:30 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>By the way, I think it's great that you dismissed everything!   It sounds very liberating!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 April 2011 at 4:31 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Congratulations, Alan!<br><br>My review has been very simple and very satisfactory so far. I write "dismissed tasks review" in C1 every time a page is dismissed, and when any of those stand out, I review whichever pages I feel like reviewing, for as long as I feel like reviewing them. Normally I have a pretty good idea which pages I haven't seen in a while, and I tend to head for those pages first.<br><br>If I dismiss about a page's worth of tasks, I do not reenter the review task, but in most cases I dismiss less, so I do reenter it. My target is to keep one of these review tasks per dismissed page.<br><br>As the dismissals mount, I wonder whether I will need more structure. I have thought of putting a bookmark (sticky flag, special color) on the last-reviewed page, and picking up each time where I left off. I can always enter two review tasks per page if I need more mileage.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 April 2011 at 6:56 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>The review procedure is very simple. You put a task "Review dimissed tasks" on your list. When it comes up you review all the highlighted tasks. You have a choice of the following:<br><br>a) Delete the task finally.<br><br>b) Delete the task and re-enter it on the list. The task may be re-phrased.<br><br>3) Leave the task for a subsequent review.<br><br>The current SuperFocus rules (under Signs and Symbols) give suggested markings for keeping track of dismissed tasks.<br><br>And don't forget to re-enter the "Review dismissed tasks" task!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 April 2011 at 9:40 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim, Thanks for the "Review page XXX" idea (I know...you got it from someone else.) I've  been passing by those Review Dismissed items a few times. I think it will help to break them up. I know that I could interpret "Review Dismissed" as 'review as many dismissed items as you feel like to feel you've done it, cross that off and reenter'. But I think I'll like the more concrete version with the page number. I'm going to give it a try.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 April 2011 at 14:20 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The problem I can see with having your list peppered with "Review Page X" type tasks is that there is no indication of what tasks are on any particular page. <br><br>Of course you could solve that problem by putting the names of the tasks, e.g. "Review Write to Aunt J.". <br><br>And indeed why bother about the "review" bit? Why not just put "Write to Aunt J."?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 April 2011 at 14:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Καλό Πάσχα!<br><br>Actually, instead of writing "Review dismissed on page N", I write "Review dismissed MM/DD".   This does give me some small indication of what might be on that list -- or, at least how old those tasks are.  <br><br>But Mark, you are right, it is not a clear indication.  <br><br>But despite that, there are still some advantages to writing "review dismissed on page N" instead of just "Review all dismissed items":<br><br>- I know I'm going to be reviewing a "closed list" of dismissed items that gets smaller every time I review it.<br><br>- I know it's going to be pretty quick and painless.<br><br>- It makes it easy to start -- there is just one page, I know exactly where it is, and it's easy.<br><br><br>I found myself resisting "Review all dismissed" because it was an ever-growing open list and I didn't really know where to start.  I currently have about 20 pages of dismissed items.   I didn't want to start a whole new system for tracking which ones were the last ones I reviewed, how and when to cycle through all the dismissed items, etc.   It's much easier to just review one page at a time.<br><br>Also, sometimes I've found that when I've finished clearing out one dismissed page, and still feel like I have some time, I may go ahead and clear out another dismissed page (or two).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 April 2011 at 0:05 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Καλό Πάσχα και καλή Ανάσταση!<br><br>Well, ok, whatever works for you. But maybe you wouldn't have so many dismissed tasks if you reviewed them all every time. Finally letting go of an idea that isn't going to work is an important part of the system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 April 2011 at 8:23 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>To get the best of both worlds, I'll write it both ways and see which ones "stand out".  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 April 2011 at 4:53 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>And make sure you delete the other one!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 April 2011 at 8:47 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan - How did your reviews go?   How is your list looking nowadays?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2011 at 5:29 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I only work this home list about once a week, so not much different yet. I have 1.5 pages, and have reviewed one page but all seems fine.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 May 2011 at 16:08 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark - <br><br>I thought I'd give an update on the two dismissal approaches -- "Review dismissed" vs. "Review dismissed on page XXX".<br><br>The "Review dismissed on page XXX" was standing out more at first -- and it was really helping the review process to get "unstuck".   "Review dismissed" all alone just seemed too "big".   <br><br>But after awhile I was finding myself reviewing the dismissed items on page XXX, and then flipping to the next page of dismissed items, and the next.<br><br>Then, more and more, the "Review dismissed" task started standing out, and the "Review dismissed on page XXX" just stopped standing out.  It's come to be quick and easy to flip through 10+ pages of dismissed tasks, and reactivate two or three of those tasks.  <br><br>And even if I can't get through them all in one pass, it's pretty easy to "bookmark" where I left off.  Whenever this happens, I just re-enter the "Review dismissed" in column 2, writing it like this -- "Review dismissed from 4/23 onward" or whatever.   And when I finally get through all of them, I re-enter "Review dismissed" in Column 1 on the last page.<br><br>So, in the end, I am happy to concede that you were right about which approach works better in general.   But it did help me to get unstuck to try a smaller review batch at each go.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 May 2011 at 22:52 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
