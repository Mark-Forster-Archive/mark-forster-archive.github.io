So I go to my Project A sublist and work that list for an hour or whatever.  Then back to the main list.<br><br>Then, let's say "Misc Scutwork" stands out.  OK, so I go to my Misc DWM list and spend 15-20 minutes working through it.  Then I go back to my main list.<br><br><br>I had two objectives:<br><br>(1) Try to stay focused on the top objectives and projects<br><br>(2) Limit the attention given to scutwork.  <br><br><br>It was pretty easy to modify my Outlook setup -- I've been using Outlook for DWM and it's been great.  So I just slightly modified some pre-defined searches to get my master list and sublists.  Took about an hour to set it up.<br><br>I was all excited to try this out!<br><br><br>So, I looked at that top-level list.  And suddenly, I was hit with overpowering anxiety.  I felt like I had blinders on.  I could not remember what was inside any of those sublists -- could not remember which projects had the most pressing action items -- which people were waiting for a response from me.  WHERE TO START?  Which of these broad project areas is really calling to me?<br><br>The anxiety was so sudden, so powerful, and so unexpected, it was really quite something to watch.  It's still got my pulse level elevated.  Pretty amazing stuff.<br><br>So, I just took a stab.  Maybe all those items under "Misc" were the ones bothering me after all.  So I started poking through that sublist.  <br><br>After about 90 seconds, I couldn't bear the anxiety anymore, and went back to the main list.   I then chose one of the top projects.  But I couldn't even concentrate enough to look at each item and process it mentally.  <br><br>So I went outside and turned on the sprinkler to water the lawn.   (I am working from home today.)<br><br>Then I ate my lunch an hour early even though I wasn't hungry.<br><br>Then I came to this forum, and looked up the Theodore Bryant book that someone recommended.  Looks interesting, kinda pricey, and I've read enough books like that to start my own library.  <br><br>Meanwhile what I *REALLY* need to be doing is just go find that email I sent that is still waiting for a response, and then set up that meeting that my coworker is waiting for me to do, then spend an hour or two on our new content model, and then maybe take a break to get ready for tonight's meeting.  Hmm, now why can't I get myself to just DO all that, without feeling so much anxiety?<br><br>The problem for me has always been:  there are so many things on my plate, I am always worried about dropping something, missing some important deadline, etc.   GTD "contexts" made the problem worse:  what about all those other tasks lurking in some other context, that needs attention right now, meanwhile I am stuck in my "at computer" context when I really need to be getting on the phone or driving to town.<br><br>It seems this attempt to reorganize my DWM lists and sublists had the same effect for me as GTD contexts -- it made it much harder to get a clear picture of what is really on my plate overall -- everything is hidden from view.<br><br>So I immediately went back to my slightly-modified DWM approach, everything on one list, a few projects broken out with non-urgent project details in project folders.   My pulse almost immediately went back to normal, and I started cranking through my list.<br><br>Very weird experience.  And very stressful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 May 2010 at 20:06 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Those GTD next actions really are useful.  I think the grouping and showing only projects can work, provided what you really put in your lists are projects linked with next action steps.  Without some detail you get lost with useless categories that don't motivate action.  In fact, if you see an unmotivating category in your DWM list, take that as a sign that your action for that category is to study it and find the thing you need to do and put /that/ in your list.<br><br>I'm currently working with a categorized AF4 list.  Can't promise I'm successful with it yet, but I made it a point that in each AF4 item (a project) I include a list of several project-related things that need work.  So I can select a specific thing (and with it the associated project) and do the AF thing to it.  It seems to be sort of working well.  Definitely not feeling the overwhelm lately.  In fact, I did this so I *could* get a clear picture of my overal plate.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 5:17 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Alan,<br><br>For me the issue is not overly-vague project names and lack of next-actions.  I actually use that concept a lot.<br><br>The problem, rather, is that there are so many miscellaneous tasks that are hard to categorize into projects.  <br><br>I was hoping to corral them, by grouping them into maintenance tasks and miscellaneous tasks, and treating them like other projects.<br><br>But this artificial grouping hid too many details, and that's what triggered the stress.<br><br>It's much easier to SEE the item, be reminded that it exists, and then skip it if needed, in order to go find the real pressing and important work.  It's certainly not perfect, and easy to fall into thinking that the scutwork needs to be done NOW.  <br><br>For me, the lesson I learned from all this, is that the scutwork DOESN'T need to be done now -- it just needs to be SEEN now.   I think I was trying to whittle those tasks away to get to a "cleaner list", with just the "important" things remaining.  And then I could really "focus" and think only about these "important" things.<br><br>But today, after the disastrous experiment, I reminded myself to SKIP those tasks unless they are really PULLING at me.   I can always let them "expire" if needed, and let them bounce around at the bottom of the waterfall, till I have time to reconsider why that happened and rethink them as needed.   This approach did help me focus on the work that was really what I knew needed to get done today.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 7:17 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Don't group what doesn't logically go together."

I can still do them after all if I change my mind.<br><br>I got this idea from Mike, basically do a brain dump of everything but actively choose things you're NOT going to do, otherwise they'll niggle.<br><br>Maybe this is where dismissal needs to be viewed as a positive thing, by freeing up time for other stuff that's more desirable.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 18:57 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>Thanks for sharing your very interesting "Disaster" tale. I'd like to hear Mark chime in, if he gets a chance to read this thread.<br><br>My own modified WM system (DWM without the D, based on Alan's original idea) continues to work well - I scan through five "week-at-a-glance" double-pages several times per day and try at least to complete my "Big Three" items for today, selected from those pages. But I know the temptation to go to one of two extremes - either (1) consolidating a long list into categories, thereby only directly maintaining a meta-list, or (2) just dumping everything ("empty your head" in GTD-speak) into the list. I still tend more toward the latter, but often use my 43-folders tickler files (one at work and one at home) to push many things forward in time (both deadline-type stuff and recurring chores), without having them cluttering up my WM list before they can possibly be "ripe" for action.<br><br>I agree with Alan that everything on the list should be, or at least obviously imply, a Next Action. On my list, I try to use action verbs rather than nebulous nouns, especially for long-running many-step projects, e.g. Call, Buy, Write, Consider, Email Someone or Something rather than just Something or Project X. While scanning the list, if you haven't already identified the next action, the process will slow down a lot. Of course there's nothing wrong with "Identify NA on Project X" as a task. In fact, it's probably a fun one, as it shouldn't take long to do, and you get to cross it off and then put the next action into your list (or tickler, if you decide it isn't ripe yet.)<br><br>Another hack that I don't use often enough is to append a question mark (?) after a possible task. This trick encourages you to list any wild idea, thereby emptying your head of it to reduce anxiety, without any implied pressure to actually do it. When you come to that item, if you decide it was silly, you can just append NO and cross it off. I think I'll go through my list write now and append some ???'s ...  ;-]</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 20:09 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've tried several ways of working a  top-level list - in fact the method given in my first book "Get Everything Done" recommends a top-level list. However the conclusion I've come to is that it really doesn't matter at what level I put an item on the list.<br><br>My own preference after a huge amount of experimenting over some ten years is for a catch-all list in which anything can go at any level. Like ubi, I use ?'s when I'm just going to make a decision whether something is worth persisting with. <br><br>I don't insist that tasks have action verbs. So here's a short selection of the items on my current list with an explanation in brackets of the more cryptic ones:<br><br>Fund raising [Take some outstanding action on the fund raising project for my church]<br>Tidy files <br>Evernote [Make sure that all new notes are categorised, etc]<br>FTSE [Check the latest FTSE stock index level]<br>"Time" [Read a specific article from that magazine]<br>Reply R <br>SpyZooka [Run the anti-spyware program of that name]<br><br>As you can see, there's no consistency in how these tasks are entered - and that's the way I like it!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 21:57 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks everyone for the comments!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 May 2010 at 19:19 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've gone back to AF4 and am finding it comforting to have everything in one place.
