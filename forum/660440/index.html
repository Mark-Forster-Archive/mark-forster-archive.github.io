It's been working well for me since the start of the beta test.

I've made plans for these new goals and added various actions to my AF list and will see how they get processed.<br>I'm now curious - has anyone else here found AF to draw them way our of their comfort zone, or does the ease of choosing and doing tasks from the list tend to stay within the normal boundaries? I'm curious because I wonder if AF would follow our normal mental patterns or lead us to change them.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Matt</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2009 at 9:07 | Matt Gregory</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Matt<br><br>I t seems that a lot of people are finding that the Auto"focus" aspect of the system is enabling them to consider pretty major changes in their lives.

And I don't think I would have allowed myself the time or resources to indulge in such an interest by being rational alone. Possibly my intuition is starting to get some air time! <br><br>Looking back at my AF List:<br><br>5th Feb - Star wars figure?<br>6th Feb - Star wars - vintage or modern figures?<br>9th Feb -  Star wars (Vintage AFA figure preferred?)<br>10th Feb - Empire Strikes Back - Han Solo - ebay<br>11th Feb - ESB Han solo received? <br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2009 at 13:29 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF can help doing things that you previously had more resistance for. In that light AF makes stuff more comfortable but you'll also be doing more. But something that has come up for me in a previous post was that AF is just a system. What you put in defines what you get out. The incentive to go beyond the current range of experience is dependent on the person. I don't think AF necessarily brings on 'real' growth on its own except higher productivity and the accompanying better feelings. (which are big things in itself, but..)<br><br>Looking at the success stories in the forums I think the theme has been about people achieving things they needed to have done, breaking through procrastination etc. But the things we procrastinate on are often not the most meaningful things in life, a core reason of procrastination.<br><br>I think the downside of using AF isolated from a broader plan or vision which you implement and review regularly, is that it facilitates falling in love with productivity and getting things done. This is part due because it works so well. This is one observation that long term use might give us more confirmation of (or not). The same goes for most other systems though. <br><br>I've always likened GTDers as spinning in a mouse wheel much faster and efficient than an average person. I wonder if AF can express itself as the equivalent to being in the mousewheel but having a smile on our face with much less stress. In other words, a much more comfortable mouse wheel. It's still a mouse wheel. Not meaning this to be a generalisation, but I think it can warrant reflection.<br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2009 at 15:42 | Peter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting comment Peter. I think you make an excellent point regarding productivity but I think when you say "What you put in defines what you get out. The incentive to go beyond the current range of experience is dependent on the person." that you hit the nail on the head. I think a lot has to do with "how" you use the system; if you use it "just" to be more productive in a specific environment or environments, work, home etc., then there is no doubt that "the system" works well in that scenario.  The "added" benefit, I think comes from the individual user's willingness to, in a way, use that "added benefit"<br><br>If I have 20 or so pages of tasks, and I use AF to get them done I become more productive, less stressed, and whizz around my wheel like a happy mouse with a smile on my face.  However, I can also choose to "experiment" - or test the system as Mark puts it - by throwing other things into the mix, and allowing myself to consider what happens as a result.  I can choose "just" to be productive or to go that one step further. It is the choices I make, based on the insights I gain from using the system, that will determine the effect of those "added benefits".  As you say "The incentive to go beyond the current range of experience is dependent on the person".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2009 at 18:59 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well put Christine aka Moneypenny!

The main benefit has been the ability to look at reasons for resistance.  With AF effectively leaving the mind a lot freer to concentrate on things outside of "how to spin the wheel" I have the choice to just to do the high resistance items to get them out of the way, or to examine why I am resisting. If I allow myself to examine the reason I then have a further choice as to whether to act on what I learn.<br><br>Tasks that have had a "meaningful exchange of information with me"? <br><br>Stacking or unstacking my dishwasher - my resistance was down to not wanting to be tied down to a specific time to do the task (true for a number of my domestic chores which are now slotting in quite nicely).<br><br>Preparing a talk (which should have been something I would have enjoyed doing) - the resistance showed me that I needed to give a talk on an entirely different subject (and yes I had the discretion to change it!)<br><br>A major project that was deadlined did not stand out - I identified that my approach to doing it was based on perfectionism and that I needed to change the approach.<br><br>Various tasks that have been high resistance I have seen are linked to fear responses such as fear of conflict.<br><br>Whilst a lot of the tasks themselves have been pretty minor the impact has been massive (and that impact had been largely unrecognised for what it was pre AF).  In some ways it is quite overwhelming to face a lot of the things that arise but on the other hand it is incredibly freeing.  What I think is so amazing about AF is that the things that are able to be identified are identified so easily, and without any sense of threat or fear.  Also I am still in the process of actioning some fairly major changes to my project management system, changes I have never made time for previously, so anticipate an even greater degree of productivity going forward - not just a happy mouse but Super Mouse! :-)<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2009 at 17:21 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I definitely love how AF encourages helping reveal resistance and create changes of day-to-day kinds of decisions and I love how you describe it Christine. It does facilitate conscious making of things that would be otherwise on 'autopilot'. <br><br>I'd love to hear if Mark has gotten out of his comfort zone since he has been doing this the longest. <br><br>With my earlier point of reflection (does AF lead to real growth, expansion etc), I think if you look at AF as a system, it doesn't do the work, but the person does. For example, I'm very conscientious about what I'm doing and where I'm going. Goal oriented, ambitious etc. <br><br>There are also people that just simply want a comfortable living, aren't ambitious, or simply don't really know what they want (yet). I don't have to look far (family etc) to witness this. To them AF is more likely to be something that makes life more comfortable. Again it comes back to the point of 'you get what you put in'. I can imagine for one group, AF actually facilitates swimming inside the comfort zone and playing it small (life just got easier). And for others it can do the reverse. At least, that's what I'm theorizing...but we don't have any longitudinal studies to corroborate one or the other.<br><br>Tracking back to Matt's post, I do think continued use of AF inevitably leads to changing patterns of thought. It makes us think and feel about tasks differently. That has an impact on living and lifestyle. But does it lead to do doing things that our outside of our comfort zone? Still depends on the person. <br><br>I can imagine that a content mouse, that is relaxed, is more likely to reach deeper insights than a mouse that is constantly battling it out in the cage. <br><br>ps. always wondered, Why does the Autofocus page mention as one of the benefits 'A greatly increased volume of work'. Isn't that the opposite of what we want? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Makes me think of the speedy GTD mouse. Better wording might be: "greater capacity to process a high amount of work with much more ease", or something like that...<br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2009 at 17:58 | Peter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Peter<br><br>Must admit I hadn't noticed the "greatly increased volume of work"  - greatly increased volume of work processed, or even greatly increased productivity, but no, I don't think I fancy the first option either :-)<br><br>I think you sum it up well when you say about simply wanting a comfortable living. It is very true that a great number of people are totally satisfied with that but for others goals and development are a vital part of who they are.  However I do not think that is necessarily a constant, and that there are also phases in life.  Whilst I think that there are often different phases in life we all go through where it may be time for us "just" to want a period of comfortable living - and let's face it that's not a bad thing! - if we fall into the latter category a lot of us just wouldn't be satisfied with that for long.  However, even when that IS what we need, that in itself can have a guilt factor attached - we feel we ought to be more ambitious etc. because that is the norm for us.  <br><br>Having been through an incredibly stressful couple of years, even though I actually needed that "comfortable living" just to recharge, I felt that there was something wrong by virtue of the fact that I had somehow lost my drive and focus.  It's strange but AF not only addressed the "doing" of things that needed to be done, but by simply creating space in my thinking naturally restored that drive and focus (which I was beginning to think had gone for ever)!<br><br>At the end of the day I am sure you are absolutely right when you say "But does it lead to do doing things that our outside of our comfort zone? Still depends on the person."  It does depend on the person - as Mark has said on numerous occasions, the system is not some magical force, but a tool to enable us to do what we need to do.  What is it that makes some people perfectly content to live a simple self sufficient lifestyle, living off the land, where others need the buzz of the city?  What is it that makes some happy with a comfortable 9-5 workday where others have to be an entrepeneur?  At the end of the day, only we know who we need to be in order to truly fulfill everthing that is within us, and the more willing we are to genuinely learn where our paths lie then the more chance we have of finding them.  Oh, dear, getting philosophical again...... :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2009 at 23:15 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey Christine. Always enjoy your responses. Wanted to leave a quick reply before heading in.<br><br>Your examples made me think of 2 things. <br><br>One is the term comfort zone. I was using it in the context of doing a range of things that you are used to doing. I think when you mention the different lifestyles and the different periods people experience in life brought up a good point. I think with the words comfort zone, it's probably better termed familiarity zone (got that term from somewhere else). <br><br>Much like living through stressful years, it became the 'comfort zone' at the time. Whether out of necessity or because you learnt to tolerate the conditions (and a lot of people do). I think part of going outside the comfort zone is stepping outside of what we'd normally do. <br><br>I think one of the trappings of productivity in general is that it reinforces &amp; is sometimes an expression of this idea of equating doing with value. Don't we measure people based on their achievements all the time in society? Hence, a good productivity system can be used in such a way that it builds a monument to doing and getting things done. <br><br>Your examples emphasize that. Sometimes we need to recharge. Sometimes doing very little is exactly the right thing to do for ourselves. And definitely, what we do depends on our own lifestyle preferences and viewpoints. But we become entrained to do what we are used to doing, over and over again. If we're trained into thinking that we must do things, get things done...it's being in the mouse wheel. In this context, a system like AF feeds the life in the wheel. I haven't said it has to. I'm just saying it can. <br><br>I think those sentiments will haunt any productivity system. I mean, walking around with a book full of things to do, is like a constant reminder that we're attached to getting things done. Some days that's a good thing, some days that's a depressing thing. Ultimately it's about how you feel in your skin about your lifestyle, your commitments, your actions etc. <br><br>And the second thing was...well this idea is so good I can't just share it at the bottom of a discussion topic...I just want to say Thank you once again Christine! You are great to bounce ideas off. <br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 February 2009 at 1:08 | Peter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Peter<br><br>"Wanted to leave a quick reply" - I see we have the same definition - your posts are getting longer than mine :-)<br><br>I really do enjoy our discsussions too - in our busy lives of "doing" how often do we make the time to really think through things? -  so thank you too! <br><br>Your comment "this idea of equating doing with value. Don't we measure people based on their achievements all the time in society?" is so very true. Have you noticed that we always ask people "what do you do?" as if what we do defines who we are.  Interestingly the reply in most cases is not "I do ......" but "I am....."  However when you take that a step further it is normally we ourselves who are actually the ones making that measurement rather than others.  How often do we hear people say "I am only ......" or "I am just ...... at the moment"  as if apologising for their "position"? (Or do/say that ourselves!)<br><br>I also think you are absolutely right about productivity systems in general.  However, the more I think I think about it, I'm actually not sure if that can be said to be true about AF.  Let me try to explain that.  I think that in life in general we will all of necessity have our lists of things to do, regardless of the complexity of of our lives and/or the complexity of the "things to do".  As people "get more important" by conventional standards they are more likely to have people to do a lot of those things for them so that conversely their prestige value switches from "doing" to having "someone else to do".  How does that affect identify?  Topic for another discussion perhaps :-).  However, if you look at the concept that doing = achieving then any system that enables more effective "doing is going to have an impact.  Again the ability to do is not bad - it is essential in any context and a very necessary part of our lives.  What is a factor though, in the concept that doing = achievement,  is in how that belief is linked to the identity of the person "doing the doing" - how that ties in with their own levels of self worth etc..  Any system, particularly the more structured ones, can increase productivity and enable life to be lived more easily and in a more managed or more controlled way.  For many, maybe even the vast majority, that will be enough.  It satisfies the basic need to keep things in order and manageable, and that is what most people want.  But what about those of us who have never found "the perfect system".  Is it the fault of the system/s?  Or is it that somehow we feel that just "doing" is not enough?  That somehow our identity is not just in our list of "things to do"? <br><br>If that makes any sort of sense :-) ....... it is for that reason that I wonder whether that does hold true for AF.  Can it be used "just" as a tool for productivity?  Perhaps if it is used in a DIT type of way, with each list being treated as a will do list, then maybe.  I would imagine that there would still be a degree of resistance to the last few items and that they will be done by the "teeth gritting" method, but yes that would increase productivity.  However, if AF is used in the way it is designed to be used, then I think my answer would have to be "no".  It is the very way in which AF not only enables you to think about reasons for resistance, but to be used fully, requires that assesment, and for genuine change to be made requires that assesment to lead to action.  If we are not prepared to "go that extra step" then the system becomes "just" another productivity tool, and to contine Mark's Rolls Royce analogy, it would be like driving a Rolls Royce and never leaving first gear.  It would get you from A to B but what a waste! <br><br>One of the amazing things about AF for me is that it does, when used fully, focus the mind, enabling us to "really" think about things that are important.  That for me is the crux of the matter - do I "just" become more productive, or do I allow myself to really think about what I do, and as a result where I am going.  I may not know the end of the journey but it sure is exciting!  It made me realise why students are often so radical - they are in an environment where they are encouraged to really think.  As we get caught up in the minutiaie of our lives - or our "to do lists", I suspect that thinking is one the first things to go - or our thinking time is very specifically directed to our work related tasks rather than our lives in general and perhaps more specifically our own paths in that life.<br><br>The other thing that made me think was your use of the phrase "familiarity zone".  It is so true that we get used to what we are familiar with and that becomes our comfort zone, and in effect acts like a security blanket that we want to hang on to at all costs.  Even things like illness can become a comfort zone - if I become ill and cannot "do" then I may sit and watch the TV.  As I am ill I do not have to feel guilty about doing so.  Take away the illness and what comes back?  The need to do and the guilt of not doing.<br><br>There's a very interesting story in the Bible where Jesus heals a cripple, but before doing so asks "do you want to be well?".  You naturally think, what sort of a question is that?  Of course he wants to be well!  But just think about what would change in that man's life - his existing daily routine was predictable - he waited to be healed.  He was looked after and cared for by friends and family.  But if he was healed what then? His whole life would change.  He would no longer be reliant on others.  He would need to look after himself, to work, to do.  Was Jesus not, by His question, pointing out to the man that his healing involved leaving his familiarity zone? <br><br>More food for thought ......... ?   :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 February 2009 at 9:15 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>No 'productivity' system is entirely about productivity.

I know I did over and over again during school, all be it nothing serious. And I'm not talking about faking, but real symptoms, fever, nausea and so on. I think that's because there is a always a pressure to do or be a certain way or have a certain outcome. Productivity systems in turn can reduce the stress, but like you say, do they make you think? It doesn't treat the root cause directly. <br><br>The bible story is a whole big discussion in itself. The ill person isn't necessarily inclined to be in concert with a healthy living lifestyle. that example does make me think of people wanting to jump from one extreme to the other in one fell swoop, that's rarely a 'healthy' or likely outcome. Especially if multiple habit patterns, thought patterns and belief patterns are supportive of the 'old situation', rather than the new one.   <br><br>DM: I think the system doesn't stretch perse, but how the individual uses it that can be stretched.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2009 at 18:34 | Peter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Peter<br><br>Wondered where you were yesterday - I was waiting for the great revelation on "the second thing"!<br><br>You are right - the whole area surrounding health and, I would have to say "non-health" (not that there is such a word!) is another fascinating study.  There are well documented examples of how stress is linked to illness and how the body's immune system is depressed by stress, leaving a person more vulnerable to general illnesses, but there is also the aspect of patterns or habits that impact us.  We might be aware in theory how a minor injury can lead to a change in posture which in turn can lead to all manner of health problems if not corrected.  Nine times out of ten that postural effect will not even have been noticed. Do we ever consider that the impact of stress and worry can have a similar effect?<br><br>When you said above "walking around with a book full of things to do, is like a constant reminder that we're attached to getting things done", it makes me wonder how much our walking around with heads stuffed full of our to do lists has impacted us more than we ever realised ............<br><br>The example of your school time illnesses also raises an interesting point.  I think there has been a very common misperception that psychosomatic illneses are somehow "put on" but the symptoms arising from causes with emotional roots are no less real than those with a physical cause.  I suspect that even the medical profession would be hard pressed to identify where one starts and the other begins sometimes.<br><br>Anyway, just a brief (for me!) post ..... :-)  Looking forward to your "second thing" post ............!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2009 at 20:30 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would agree, I think the health industries are slowly coming about with a more encompassing view on health issues, causes and cures. I don't think there is anything that offers us more direct influence on our body's than our own thoughts. And if one acknowledges that and you realize we think pretty much non-stop, you can imagine that the compound effects of thoughts make a major impact. <br><br>But yes, if your thoughts are full of to-do's what does that indicate? Is a to-do list, or AF notebook an extension, or even externalisation of our mind or a product of our thoughts. If you consider it an externalisation it exposes how much we let our life be run by future actions. <br><br>I'll send you my 'second thing' by email if you're curious? I'm keeping it secret from the public for the moment... want to test it first.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 February 2009 at 10:23 | Peter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ah now that opens a whole new concept - "living in the now"!  That is a big subject!  But, briefly, as AF seems to be so adept at dealing with past issues (by means of identifying resistance factors and enabling us to address them) do you not think that the very reorganisation of our "life processes", for want of a phrase, will enable more productive future planning and by so doing free us up to live in the now?<br><br>And yes I am curious :-)  I've posted an email address in the AF Web Application Post so wait to hear!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 February 2009 at 10:47 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Peter and Christine:<br><br>I think one of the major benefits of AF for me has simply been the feeling "it's in AF, it'll get sorted". Even with DIT I never really quite had quite that confidence in the system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 February 2009 at 21:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
