When doing the first task, I find myself needing to do another task further down the open list, in order to complete the first task. I just mark both tasks for doing, cross out the first task, unmark the second task, and go to next task after the first one when I completed the first task.<br><br>Any better way? ;-)<br><br>Should I really consider the first task as not "ready", continue down the open list as normal, complete the second task, multi cycle round the closed list, get back to open list, and then only do the "now ready" first task? Mmm ...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 1:55 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think this is a matter of trusting your intuition and not making the system too complex.<br><br>If you are in the middle of a task, anything you need to do to keep working on it "for as long as you feel like" is part of that task.  It is no different than adding it twice.  When you get to it (or just notice it) on your list, cross it out and take credit for doing it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 2:55 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You also have to think if your productivity is served by going to the list in the midst of doing "things".  IOW, if I'm out in the barn because I see a task: "Muck the Stables" ;-) and I notice that part of a fence is falling down, I can either fix it right then or get into the jeep and drive back to the ranch house to make a note of it to do later ;-)  A silly example, perhaps, but I think it illustrates the things that affect my decision.<br><br>- How much overhead is there in going to the list at the moment<br>- How much work is involved in doing the new task right now<br>- What is the potential of missing something of higher priority if I do it now<br><br>It just all depends.  That is why I like my pocket book system.  Now that I'm experimenting with AF4 as Mark does it, I'm using a larger format book and I am finding that this situation crops up much more frequently.  IOW, I'm often not near my book and don't want to drop what I'm doing to go back and fool with a book when I know I should just do the damn work in front of me while I'm on the scene.  YMMV, of course ;-)<br><br>As to your question ... IMO, it does not matter.  The point of the system is to enhance productivity.  Do what seems to be most productive for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 10:01 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike wrote:<br><br>'I'm out in the barn because I see a task: "Muck the Stables" ;-) and I notice that part of a fence is falling down, I can either fix it right then or get into the jeep and drive back to the ranch house to make a note of it to do later ;-)'<br><br>I agree, though for the sort of person that's easily distracted, it might be beneficial not to feed those tendencies by responding on the spur of the moment.<br><br>If that was me I'd be at risk of fixing the fence immediately, find something else, then something else again, and maybe forget all about mucking out the stables... ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 September 2009 at 18:17 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Simley,<br><br>The horses would probably remind you ;-)  But I do take your point.  I'm of two minds about using this system for therapy.  I'm hoping that I'll find some kind of middle ground where the system will basically support my own way of being but I don't have to be hide bound by rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2009 at 11:36 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks MartyH, Mike and SmileyPete for the feedback. I'll try to trust my intuition more, but I also have to be wary of being distracted and continually doing necessary things and further necessary things, for current active task. I think I'll have to explore more what "doing little and often" means ...<br><br>Anyway, apologies for my late reply. Having a major hols on 20sep09, does take you away to more urgent part of the AF4 list then the "Read AF forum from 18sep09 2108" task. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2009 at 9:44 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re: Little and often.  I did not really get what that idea was until I watched Mark do his demo on AF4.  Ironically it is just what the name implies ;-)  You just work on something so long as you feel like it, then write it down do to it again and move on for now.  When you see it again, you are not so afraid of it because you KNOW you don't have to do the whole thing, but you CAN just drop it after a while if you want.<br><br>The flip side of this (conceptually, but it is really the same idea) is to work from a timer and stick WITH a task for a period then take an enforced break.  I really hate the hoo-haa about giving it a cool name (like Pomodoro) because it is just using a damn timer and that idea has been around since there WERE timers.  There is something about the sound of the timer going off that basically says "Are you doing what you should be doing?"  I dunno, it does seem to work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2009 at 11:19 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, the timer works great for me to keep me going with the "little and often" idea.  When I have multiple projects that all need to be moved forward, I just work on each one for 15 minutes at a time (or maybe 5, or maybe 30), and then do a hard stop when the timer beeps.  It's really quite effective.  I've been amazed sometimes how much it really is possible to do in 15 minutes.  It really can help move those projects forward that have been facing resistance for a long time, too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2009 at 22:08 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I used to have a really hard time stopping when my timer went off - my procrastination problem has always been about resistance starting a task, so I didn't realising that a work "binge" when I finally got moving was just as bad for me, because it left me too burnt out to approach the task a second time without trepidation.<br><br>So I started to practice "stopping" when the timer went off, without actually working on anything that I needed to stop doing between rings...hope that makes sense here, sort of like Pavlov's dogs IYSWIM.<br><br>I stole the idea from Steve Pavlina (who used the technique to train himself to get out of bed as soon as his alarm clock rang). Works a treat.<br><br>The other thing that works really well for me is the "ticking clock" timer that Andreas designed right here on Autofocus - its insistent ticking (like the Countdown clock, for the Brits on here) is great for boosting efficiency.Perhaps one of the more active members of the forums would be kind enough to post this as a tag for the new users of the forum who may have missed it?

Personally, I have one of those Timex Ironman Triathlon watches ... it has four timers that can take different actions when they expire ... I most often use the "repeat" function so it just keeps on looping.  It is by far handier than even the very nice timers on the iPhone.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 September 2009 at 18:31 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ah, I got one those Timex Ironman #T56371 too. But when working I tend to miss the alarm. I'll try the Timex 15mins cycle for the "little and often", and see whether I can focus on the alarm buzzer this time. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 September 2009 at 9:56 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, if you work outside, in a noisy environment, the alarm is in fact hard to hear.  Indoors it is just fine, in my experience.  My personal settings are:<br><br>- 15 minutes (sometime I do 20) for short tasks<br>- hourly chime if I'm not doing anything in particular task based<br>- 10 minutes if I'm under severe time pressure to meet a deadline<br><br>I have not played with it yet but it ought to be possible to do one of those pomodoro thingies by having the 10 minute alarm roll to the 2 minute alarm and then that roll back to the 10 minute one.  I'll try it later ;-)<br><br>In all cases, the alarm repeats.  Very handy.<br><br>I've tried the phone, but with all its function, it is useless to alert you if you have to actually use the phone for ... well, calling someone ;-)  Mel mentioned something called NotifyMe (for the iPhone) which uses "push" alarms.  That might work when talking on the phone.  I have no experience with that yet.  But if it DID work, it would probably hang up the phone in the middle of a call.  None of this stuff seems ready for prime time yet.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 September 2009 at 11:30 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike,<br><br>"I can either fix it right then or get into the jeep and drive back to the ranch house to make a note of it to do later ;-)"<br><br>I keep a piece of folded A4 and a pen on me in case of such a predicament.

That's so odd.  Deb did make some comment about too many animal posts, but  blocking you?  How very odd.  I may have to start a new group ... all animal stories all the time ;-)<br><br>Wuss ... yeah.  I think the funny part was that the water was warm and it kind of crept up on her.  She was a prize.  One day the wind blew the front door open and she got out.  I searched the neighborhood for a week for her.  One day it was pouring rain and something told me to open the front door ... there she was ... drenched, looking like a drowned rat.  She looked inside, then looked at me as if to ask if she could come in.  Poor thing, she was pretty fat at the time and when she reappeared she had lost a lot of weight - maybe one third.  I'm sure she was too fat to close much distance on any of the local bunnies!  LOL ;-)  I doubt she ate all week long.<br><br>So I scooped her up and threw her in a warm bath ... she did not object in the slightest.  I don't know if it felt good to be warm and clean or she just accepted it as pennance or punishment.  I washed her in shampoo and so she smelled like a big black coconut.  I even turned the blow dryer on her and you know how noisy those are ... it must have hurt her ears but she said not a word.  Then I fed her ... she ate two cans of cat food.  Then she climbed into my lap and went to sleep.  After that, for a few months, she dogged (pardon the expression) my every step ... she did not want me out of her sight.  I wonder what her adventure was like.  I hate to think of how many times she must have come back and not been able to get in ... poor thing.  Silly thing.

It is no different than having personal relationships at work.  You go to work for the job, but you'll certainly talk with others about your mutual love of bowling ;-)  Can it go too far?  I actually don't think so ... that is my philosophy, anyway.  The only way it gets out of hand is if people get hot about someething or other ... I feel that has to be moderated.  Much as if a fist fight broke out over bowling scores at work ;-)<br><br>Some people just get overly protective about their lists ... others, not so much.  Mark is a pretty "live and let live" guy.  Deb can get ... well, "moody", is the best way I can describe it.  The downside of that approach is that those most apt to have their posts rejected are those who post the most.  And they are the "fuel" that makes the list run.  As I said, probably fewer than 5 percent of the list membership post at all ... if you lose some of them the list can run out of fuel and just grind to a halt ... the others are not going to jump in ... they, the lurkers, don't post because that is not their nature.  They learn by watching, not by participating.  If the conversation stops, they don't jump in and keep it going, they just pick up their drink and wander of to lurk on the fringes of some other conversation.<br><br>Anyway, it is what it is.  If there is any strong demand for a place to talk about our pets, one of us can start such a list.  But that is problematic as well.  It would be like telling everyone interested in bowling that they had to get a new job.  And if you are interested in bowling and baseball, you'd have to get TWO new jobs.  That is just silly.  We are multi-faceted and social beings.  Artificial classification only goes so far.  And how would I know that we are both pet lovers if I had not mentioned my cat ... or wood workers (to whatever extent ;-) if you had not mentioned building your desk (or was it me saying I wanted to build a standing desk?)  If I mention that I'm listening to Al Jarreau just now ("Summer Breeze") I might learn that you are a Jazz lover ... who knows?  But then should we need to start a new list to discuss our (possibly) mutual love of Jazz?  How silly can this get?  LOL ;-)<br><br>As to Laffee, yeah, I was sick about it.  She was my only cat and I lived alone at the time and the house was empty without her.  Awful.  Not nearly as awful as it was when she died, however.  The downside of falling in love with pets.  I'm still mourning the loss of Thelma.  &lt;sigh&gt;   Hopefully Mark will not crack down on our off-topic banter, or then I WILL start a "pet lover, wood worker, Jazz affectionado, whatever" list!  Now what to call it ... hmmmmm...  ROTFLMAO ;-)<br><br>One day, a few months ago, someone started an informal poll of professions on this list.  It was fascinating to observe how the place took on "color" (that's the only way I can think to describe the feeling) once the names took on more human form.  I find that I simply LIKE Will more now that I saw a fuzzy snap of Rosie.  I can't help it.  He is no longer such a faceless name now that I have an image of his kitty trying to help him manage his lists ;-)<br><br>OBTW, I don't have a picture, but Fitz will sit on top of the printer and look over and inside the slot where the paper comes out to try to figure out what is going on in there, when I print something.  Of course, he swats at the paper as it comes out and that screws up the collation something terrible ;-)  I'm going to utilize him next time I have a paper jam, he loves to get his paws in there ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 October 2009 at 11:16 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good Morning, Will<br>Because my memory is so unreliable, I forgot about my October wallpaper.

Otherwise, I'd be swooning in admiration like a chatty school girl talking about her first crush! &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I like all kinds of music ... well, I guess because I don't classify stuff like Smashing Pumpkins as music ;-)<br><br>My wife is a band director ... I think I mentioned that.  She teaches music, concert band, marching band, arranges musicals for the school, and from time to time plays bassoon in the local civic orchestra.  She is really quite something.  Anyway, I never thought much about band music until I met her ... now I kind of like band music.  I'll never match her enthusiasm for it, but I do like it.<br><br>I'm more in love with the big romantic composers: Brahms, Schuman, etc.  And the romantic/moderns: Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Khachaturian, etc.  Oh, and most piano and organ works.  I love Jazz (Charlie Parker, to be sure).  I also like Swing.  As I say, there is pretty much no music I don't like.  (Grover Washington is playing right now ... "Mister Magic")<br><br>I mentioned that I used to run with an artist crowd ... in the '60's '70's (has it really been that long?)  So I'm also a big fan of the visual arts: Michaelangelo, Da Vinci, Dali, Vermeer, Maxfield Parrish ... I'm pretty eclectic there as well.  I loved that time in my life because I had never been with such creative people as my artists friends were.  (One year a couple decorated their apartment in ultraviolet paint and had UV lamps everywhere.  The placed looked like "It's a Small World"  ROTFLMAO ;-)<br><br>As to literature, the same is true.  I mostly read non-fiction (hard science and psychology, mostly), but I can get lost for days in fiction if I allow myself.  My preference there is for GOOD WRITING ... something increasingly hard to find.  Ray Bradbury is one of my favorites ... but there are so many ... H.H. Munro also comes to mind.  Recently I've started working my way through the Western Canon, via "The Great Books of the Western World" of which I am the lucky owner of a first (i.e. 54 volume) edition.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  You really do know me....better than most current 3-D characters in my little life! &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I would not classify your life as "little", by any means.  Just ask your fur ball for her opinion on the matter ;-)  But yeah, I think we know each other better than "real" people do because what we exchange here are those things that are most important to us.  I have a neighbor who I exchange "favors" with.  She takes me shopping at the big box store in her truck, and watches our cats when we are away.  I help the nurses move her kid (wheel chair bound) when she is away and take care of her dog.  Yet she does not begin to know who I am  (after 23 years!) simply because she does not share any of my values (that I can ascertain) nor does she exchange information of any importance (to me, at least.)<br><br>Of course, on-line life can be as trivial and meaningless as any, but the things I share with my on line "buddies" are apt to be more important to who I am ... essentially.  And I think we all worry when one of our "buddies" vanishes for a while.  (I'm missing Christine and do hope she is doing well.)  I've also not heard from Jacqueline lately.  (Hmmmm, do you think there is a Clark Kent / Superman thing going on there?

LOL ;-)  All I have to do is mention a word like "epistemology" and the sounds of heads hitting tables across cyberspace is deafening ;-)   And if I wander down to my local Starbucks or Panera, the weightiest conversation I could get going would be on the temperature of the coffee!   Alas, I fear my great debates are behind me.  Now I just read and debate with myself.  That is one sure way to win an agument!!!  ;-)<br><br>But Europe can be another matter.  Back in the early '80's I took the first vacation of my life ... my then wife told me I could come or not, but she was going ;-)  In any case, after Greece and Italy, we went to Bern to visit some friends.  I really would love to have moved there, but there was no way to afford it.  But they had ONE TV station and it was only on for a couple of hours a day and the picture was unwatchable.  The locals visited pubs (I don't know what else to call them ... coffee shops / pubs / restaurants / ????)  in any case, they had a "route".  They would go to the same one at the same time each day and meet the same people and talk for a while.  Then they would go to the next and meet a different set of people ... on into the night when they would have a late dinner.  What a way to live.  Now THERE is a place you can discuss metaphysics.  Actually, almost anything.  Europeans are so much better educated and more aware than Americans are.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Sometimes I'm really embarrassed.  When Bush was in office, I was always apologizing.  Sheesh.

She works so hard.  Today she is hosting a Band Competition at her school.  Something like 30 bands or some such nonsense.  She organized the whole thing, getting judges, supplies, coordinating, etc.  She is awesome.  Two days ago she was shocked to realize that she had to provide audio tapes.  (Each band is taped with a running monologue by the judges who walk out on the field with them, and others in the boxes judging music and arranging, etc.  So there are 6 judges and something like 30 bands which is like 180 tape cassettes ... the bands get to keep them to review comments.)  Well, the mad scramble was on, where to buy that many tapes and get them delivered overnight!  She did it!!!  LOL ;-)  So today is the event.  She will get home at about 1:00am, have one day off, then it is back to it.  Monday morning it's back to her classes of 80 sixth graders.  She is an energetic powerhouse.<br><br>I kid her about her job.  I tell her: "In what other jobs do you get paid to have little kids hug you?"  LOL ;-)  The kids are funny.

If it's on the closed list and doesn't get dumped, then it's probably important!  Mark did a great job with this latest incarnation of autofocus.

We also had rigatoni ... with big gobs of ricotta on it.  WooHoo.  ;-)  Lisa met me there and was on her second strawberry martini when I got there.
