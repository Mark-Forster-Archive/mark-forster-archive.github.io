I'm beginning to think that I either just don't have the gene, or (more likely) I am just no good at setting goals (that get me excited) and figuring out how to achieve them (which of course is what drives the todo list).<br><br>I'd really appreciate some practical help with this - I've even looked at personal development seminars but they are horribly expensive!  Can anyone point me to any work, blogs, books etc on setting goals that I might find useful and which are practical?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2011 at 15:15 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My first suggestion is to read Mr. Forster's book _How to Make Your Dreams Come True_ which is available at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/6/2/how-to-make-your-dreams-come-true.html">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/6/2/how-to-make-your-dreams-come-true.html</a> . In a nutshell, you envision yourself in the future-- see the person that you want to be-- and focus more on the feelings than on material things. For example: "I have a clean desk because it makes me feel more organized and less chaotic." You can then focus on creating those feelings and discover different ways to obtain those feelings. In a way, it lets you focus on the *results* of your goals, which lets the goals themselves float up out of the aether.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2011 at 16:12 | jFenter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison,<br><br>You may like the simple approach I espouse in Desire Outcomes Implementation Technology.  It is a paper based system to identify and achieve three desired outcomes or goals.  Personally, I have found that separating life goals from the day to day time management we all do was a much better approach.  You can get the ebook for free on my site it is a very quick read and easy to get started with.

I'm not sure if you realize that this web site is about Mark Forster's time management approaches, which are different from GTD. Many of us find Mark's approaches work better for us, but YMMV.<br><br>You might want to read one of Mark's time management books (Do it Tomorrow or Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play). Or you might want to read his book How to Make Your Dreams Come True <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/storage/How%20To%20Make%20Your%20Dreams%20Come%20Word%2097.doc,">http://www.markforster.net/storage/How%20To%20Make%20Your%20Dreams%20Come%20Word%2097.doc,</a> which is now a free download. The latter works on the Pull principle, as opposed to the Push principle of the other two books.<br><br>Or, you might want to look at Mark's latest system, Superfocus (there is a menu bar item on top for this), which comes out of his earlier Autofocus systems (see blog archive).<br><br>Or... maybe really want to focus on GTD... in which case you are not on the right web site (although you could search for GTD as there has been some discussion of it on the boards, but mostly in relation to Mark/'s approaches).<br><br>I hope this helps.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2011 at 22:27 | silviastraka</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Many people here struggled and failed at GTD. A common opinion is that it's more complex than valuable. Superfocus achieves most of what GTD promised but fails to deliver by an extreme focus on doing. As for goals, they get added to SF as things to think about and plan. The idea is to gradually develop both your goals and achievement of them. <br><br>"how to make tour dreams come true" is a completely different approach focusing on big picture idea generation leading to spontaneous action. <br><br>What these approaches have in common is Mark's distillation of psychological principles into very easy methods designed to encourage success by enhancing your natural inclinations.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2011 at 3:57 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm sorry - when I said 'getting things done' I meant in a general sense not in a GTD sense (which I found far too complex) sense. I have read all of Marks books and indeed tried most of his systems, and contributed in this forum on and off for the last 2-3 years. I understand that his approach is about getting through the todo list generally.  What I am asking help for is really setting goals and recording projects that then make up the todo list. So it's really the bit that comes before.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2011 at 9:11 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I thought the name looked familiar...  If Gerry's book doesn't suit, I'd suggest just writing goals in AF, and separately have a work area to elaborate on them. To work a goal is to work this page, and think about tasks that may get you there. Enter such in AF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2011 at 13:32 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oops. Sorry. When I saw you had capitalized and put into quotes 'Getting things Done' I assumed you were talking about GTD. <br><br>I've been using Dreams. As @jfenter said, "it lets you focus on the *results* of your goals, which lets the goals themselves float up out of the aether". Dreams also has a process to zoom into your goals and develop them at a more detailed level. <br><br>My complex projects are mostly text based, since I am an academic. So I use Scrivener (now available in Windows Beta) to organize all the materials for my course prep, the articles I write, and my research projects. I usually create a text document within Scrivener to make notes about any next steps or things I need to do or keep in mind. When I see the project name come up in SF, I open my Scrivener project and scan the Tasks document to figure out what needs to be done next. <br><br>For this kind of low-key approach to projects, you could also use Evernote or OneNote.<br><br>I really like Mark's advice to manage projects only to the degree absolutely necessary. So Scrivener for projects and SF for tasks, all under the Dreams umbrella, is working quite well for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2011 at 13:53 | silviastraka</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison:<br><br>Some suggestions.<br><br>1. each day, for a week, write out 10 answers to "What I seek from living now is..."<br>2. ask yourself what adds to your life, and what reduces it<br>3. appreciation: maybe your goal is to maintain the aspects of life that you are satisfied with?
