In my day-to-day work, I have found that my most successful days are when I take some time to simply physically write out all of the things that are buzzing around in my head.  Journaling style.<br><br>Often it starts out as a bunch of ramblings and expressions of emotions, but I have noticed that it also often turns to some clarifying direction and action plans that helps me push through on projects or tasks that I'm stuck on.  <br><br>For a long time, I'd tell myself I didn't have time to write/journal, because I had too much to do. Lately I'm thinking, I have so much to do, I need to write/journal  to help me get it done.  <br><br>Similar to Mark's Dreams book,  I'm finding that the slightly more structured conversations with my self that writing provides are actually one of my best productivity hacks.<br><br>I'd love to hear if anyone else has experienced this and if so, how have you made writing/journaling part of your productivity process? <br><br>Brent</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2024 at 18:29 | Brent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Perhaps this might depend on how much one is writing.  If one is writing much of the day as part of one's work, either handwriting or typing, which is both a physical and mental activity, then more writing might be more of same, and not provide a break. <br>Also if one is keeping a long list, such as Autofocus,  which fulfills some of the same functions as a journal if one is brainstorming and writing down as a catch-all list, then more writing might not be as useful. <br>The default mode of the brain is the mind-wandering mode, and perhaps some journaling is useful for this.  I am not sure when it is better to write or not write.  For some it might be better to  go outside and sit and watch the clouds drift by, and hear the rain fall, and listen to the bird sing, and notice your breathing.  Or take a walk to the nearest park, and smell the flowers, and see the children playing, and spot a fish jumping.  Apparently, the brain is active when it is wandering, and making connections in the brain, and perhaps it is better to try not to make it happen. <br><br>This is why I question the advice of Cal Newport to plan every minute of the day.  I don't think he himself does this, but it does not allow for the opportunity to do nothing, or to do things spontaneously with freedom.  I read that Cal Newport will sometimes if he is thinking of a problem, will take a walk in nature and think about the problem.  But it might be better to take a walk in nature and not think about the problem.  Cal Newport also has a thinking chair where he will sit with paper and will write.  But for some, it might be better just to sit and think, and for others just to sit.  <br><br>Some do start journaling as a daily practice, but it can become a chore, and they become bored, and give it up.  However, some are bored, and they turn to journaling.  Apparently boredom can be a good thing, and is related to the mind-wandering mode.  Some advise just facing our boredom. <br><br>Journaling is a broad term, and someone could write the pros and cons of a decision, or plan a project, or do a mind dump, or write in a bullet journal - are they journaling? Do they need to write complete sentences or not?  Or express emotions or write the events of the day? <br><br>I am just thinking aloud.  Perhaps we should listen to our inner promptings, and that will tell us what we need to do.  There have been times in my life when I journaled, and they were times of emotional stress and uncertainty, and it was helpful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2024 at 21:05 | Mark H.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I might have come across too negatively in my last post.  In the past my regular practice has been to write a lot (several pages a day), and am trying to find a better balance in my life now.  <br><br>Perhaps Aaron can chime in here, but my impression is that the Autofocus method of starting with a catch-all list replaced the Dreams method, so that the brainstorming/rewriting/journaling of the Dreams book wouldn't be necessary in the Autofocus system because one is regularly brainstorming/processing/and rewriting in sifting the long list. <br><br>However, if one has no long list, which involves a lot of writing, or one uses an intuitive approach with little writing, one might need to do what David Allen in GTD calls "capturing".  As I remember, he advocates journaling, brainstorming, mind dumps, etc.  <br><br>If one is not writing much, some regular form of writing might help.    I find it useful to mix up and change my methods rather than use solely one method.  So it might be helpful to take your list to a different environment, or journal - in a coffee shop, library, outdoors, or vacation.  On the other hand, it is good to sometimes leave your list or planner at home.  Or not to use it for part of the day or week.  Plan some of the day. but leave some of the day unplanned.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2024 at 4:34 | Mark H.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;I'd love to hear if anyone else has experienced this and if so, how have you made writing/journaling part of your productivity process?&gt;&gt;<br><br>My entire workflow/system is based on journaling. In a previous post on this forum, I shared some images of what this looks like. My plan is to record a video, throw it on YouTube, and share a link in this forum.<br><br>The barebones version: <br><br>1. (Paper/pen) Throughout the day, capture what you're doing, what you've done. Stick to the facts, only include feelings if they're provide crucial context to the facts. Example: 6:26am - Read Mark Forster's Autofocus instructions<br><br>2. On a separate index card, I rewrite (daily) intentions, tasks, and goals I'm focused on at the start of the day. Inspired by the book Time Surfing, I don't refer to this index card throughout the day. I assume fear, motivation or some other force will help me get done what needs to get done. The purpose of rewriting the list daily is two-fold:  1. primes my brain for what I've committed to, and what I'm avoiding. 2. Reduces anxiety/worry that I'm going to forget something.  Example:<br><br>- Contact car dealership<br>- Pay attention to Sammy's interaction with Izzy<br>- Sign up for hockey lessons<br><br>3. At the end of the day, I take scribblings from #1 and type them into a document (Pages, Mac) and include any photos or sketches. I add emoticons for every project I'm working on. <br><br>4. On January 1, I export the Pages document as a PDF and sent it to LuLu. A few days later, a beautiful hardcover work/life journal shows up at my house.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2024 at 12:55 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Phew... for those who are interested, I threw together a blog post (with photos) documenting my journaling process: <br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://nadigel.com/meaning/journal">http://nadigel.com/meaning/journal</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2024 at 13:40 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum, <br><br>I looked at your blog post. From what I can see you are doing: schedule today, record today's events, plan today, review today, review and plan week, and publish the diary of the whole year. I'm doing some of all of those although maybe not as organized. I use for every month a composition book with 200 pages and I fill up at least half of it maybe 150 pages. And I collect them and I have about 3 years worth of them and then several years before that when I use the moleskine. However I'm wondering what to do with them now and I rarely look at them and they are not in a format that is easy to review. I can see your published year would be very easy to review.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2024 at 15:37 | Mark H.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark H.<br><br>&lt;&lt;From what I can see you are doing: schedule today&gt;&gt;<br><br>I don't do any form of time-blocking. I abhor that type of Cal Newport-ish planning. I simply copy my appointments from iCal to my daily planning page, and indicate available discretionary time. I then adopt a "Time Surfing" approach to discretionary time. <br><br>&lt;&lt;review and plan week&gt;&gt;<br><br>Not exactly. On Friday, I reread my daily entries, and add footnotes to any idea/project that requires  more context. It provides a more organic feel for the entries, and is cool to re-read in the future. <br><br>I don't do any type of planning for the upcoming week. As a therapist, my client times are already booked. The same for my kid's activities, supper/cooking, etc. <br><br>&lt;&lt;publish the diary of the whole year&gt;&gt;<br><br>This is a critical - and very enjoyable - part of the process. Mostly because my children will inherit the story of their "ol' man" - good, bad and ugly. I wish my late father (and grandparents) did something similar. <br><br>&lt;&lt; However I'm wondering what to do with them now and I rarely look at them and they are not in a format that is easy to review.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Without some form of formatting, coupled with an aesthetic that is pleasing to you (very subjective), I can appreciate why there might be resistance to reviewing your notes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2024 at 16:11 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like interstitial journaling. You cycle between two things, doing and writing:<br><br>1. Thinking of what you want to do next, writing that down.<br><br>2. (try to) do that thing<br><br>3. writing down how it went and any thoughts about it.   Go to step 1.<br><br>Here's one random article about it: https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling (She mentions you can write the time on the entries so you can also use it for time tracking.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2024 at 17:10 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Don R, <br><br>Thanks for your post.  I have not heard of "interstitial journaling" before, and I went to the article that you recommended, and google searched it.  I can see that this is similar to what I have been doing, and might be helpful to me.  I see also that someone combines this with Rapid Logging from Bullet Journaling.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2024 at 18:14 | Mark H.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cool thoughts and links Mark, Don, and Avrum.  Keep them coming everyone.  I'd never heard of interstitial journaling.  It looks like something I want to try.  <br><br>Brent</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2024 at 20:29 | Brent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I really like Interstitial Journaling (IJ).  So far it is a much more tangible way to follow many of the concepts in the Time Surfing book.  I'm still keeping a separate task/project list that I can refer to as needed.  IJ hasn't replaced that master list.   The journaling is in a separate notebook and is really just helping me focus on closing out what I just did and then focus on what I'm going to do next.  It feels very "present" and has so far helped me bust some pretty severe procrastination tendencies I've had as of late.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 June 2024 at 16:39 | Brent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Working digitally, here.  I have a mode of working to create a journal that goes like this.<br><br>1. Have a list of things I want to work on.<br>2. When I have done a thing, move that item to a 'recently did' log.<br>3. Occasionally review the log ("Review log" is on the todo list above).  Things of note are moved into a journal, with possibly details added (how well did the task go, what's the outcome like).  Follow up work for things in the log are added into the system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 June 2024 at 16:14 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Freeform journaling as a method for thinking through problems and thoughts has been a pillar of my life since at least as early as I could write (6 or 7 years old). I find it immensely useful to be able to simply write out my thoughts and feelings as though I am having a dialogue with myself. <br><br>I tend to prefer unstructured exploration and talking to myself more than anything else, but if I do put structure on it, I usually start a journal session with a title that asks a question or establishes a topic. Otherwise, Morning Pages and the page limit idea is also very nice when I just want to clear my head and I am itching to write. <br><br>My life is organized enough right now that a simple monthly diary and the morning prompt of asking myself what I wish to accomplish on a given day suffices for task lists for me. However, I still regularly work through tough ideas or feelings via journalling, and I find it highly effective. <br><br>For myself, I find the conversational form more effective than just making lists of things, but I'm long winded anyways.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 June 2024 at 10:13 | Aaron Hsu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Did you decide to think-journal on your own, or who taught you this idea?  I find it remarkable it was practiced so young.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 June 2024 at 16:13 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I wasn't given a lot of guidance or structure, but rather, I remember my mother at the time handed me a brown marbled faux-leather notebook and said that I could keep a daily journal in it, and write whatever I wanted about the day and how I felt. I can't remember, but I think she would also look over it from time to time. I still have that original journal. <br><br>In a sense, I don't know if it was as much taught to me as something that emerged through careful observation of myself and my mother. I think we realized early on that writing enabled me to be more honest and direct with things, and would let me express ideas that I might otherwise have found challenging to express verbally because of their complexity and the time it takes to put them down. By having me write them down, it created a space in which I had the time to put the words down in a form that I liked, and it also enabled her to read them and get a feel for what was going on without having to sit there the whole time waiting for me to try to express things directly. <br><br>Recognizing the value of that sort of buffer between us was something that I think she had insight for, and that's how it originally came about, but there wasn't anything more structured than that for a long time. Since no one had time to listen to me drone on and on for hours at a time on my thoughts, being able to express them in writing made it possible for me to do as much thinking as I wanted to do without needing to have someone else there to listen.<br><br>It certainly wasn't understood in the same way that journalling today has become such a fashionable idea, and maybe I was better off for that, because I developed my own style. <br><br>I do think that if I didn't have this, it would have ironically been much more "lonely" for me, because being able to write always gave me the ability to talk things out even when there was no way that there were any peers or elders who could actually sympathize or empathize with me. But having that writing enabled me to have a vehicle of expression that tempered my interactions with others and I think helped manage a lot of things growing up, which made me a much more stable character over time compared to many of my peers (all of them?). <br><br>I also think it really helped me gain a kind of clarity and maturity that didn't exist for others of my age, but then again, maybe that's a chicken and egg problem, because my mother likes to joke that I was always a serious, old person even as an infant.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 June 2024 at 5:34 | Aaron Hsu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
