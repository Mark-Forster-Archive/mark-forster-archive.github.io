I carry it nearly always with me. That's the reason, why I put errands on the backsite of the list. I also carry a pilot g-2 (pen) in my right trouser pocket (clip outside - pen inside).<br><br>I pocess stuff from this notebook in an similar way as DA suggests.<br><br>Stuff which will not be sorted out will go to my SF list - a pocket sized moleskin (the thin one, which comes in 3 notebooks in one package). Left site C1 - right site C2.<br>I work with the list exactly to the rules of SF.<br>If the molesin is full, I transfer important/outstanding stuff to a new one and dismiss the rest. <br><br>For time related stuff I use a pocket sized moleskin calender (1 week on 2 pages - horizontal).<br><br>I switch form AF1DiT (a AF1 tweak which combines Autofocus and DoItTomorrow in an IMHO effective way) to SF. Compared, I found SF more balanced. I'm quite sure that SF will also work as SFDiT. But I will give plain SF a chance.<br><br>The only shortcoming (but I can't blame SF) is, that I can't go through the whole list in one day. To much ad-hoc stuff coming up if I leave the car after commuting from work and enter my home ;-) <br><br>I also do a weekly review (I have an entry in my calendar every friday) where I check ~ 2 weeks before and ~6 weeks after the current day. I also check my projectlist and do a slow reading/thinking of the task on my SF list. In this go some of the entries will be deleted, rephrased, etc.<br><br>Work:<br>I use Outlook as hard landscape and started a week ago with SF on excel (before I used AF1DiT with mylifeorganzied).<br><br>- Jens</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2011 at 11:27 | jens</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Paper. More precisely, a coat-pocketable notebook (same height as A6 paper but slightly narrower). A problem I've always had with my to-do systems is neglecting to actually use them. One part of that problem is simple (lack of) physical presence. Books or binders that are bulky tend to get stowed away out of sight. Lists on a computer are entirely out of sight until called up. The current notebook so far has managed to be reliably present. (The one downside of a smaller notebook is that it only gives around 20 lines per page. I combine facing pages into a single "virtual" page.)<br><br>With this notebook always present, my second important time management component, the calendar, could actually be on a computer. It currently isn't, but that's not an important choice.<br><br>In another thread, I've described a precursor to the system I run in that notebook (called AF Advance). I don't currently recommend trying it as described.<br><br>To my thinking, it is important that the AF1-like systems, like the one I'm using, are not a substitute for a calendar or a clock. They work best with tasks that are ready to do now, but at the same time not so urgent that they have to be done immediately, or at a specific time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2011 at 12:19 | Marcus</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Only 10 days into SF. I've been home on vacation and go back to work today. At home I've been using a large Moleskine (cahier) I've been using it for collecting and doing. I haven't yet figured how my old OmniFocus-GTD system will fit into it. I'll reflect on that next weekend. For now, as I've dismissed things that I will want to revisit, I've put them into one Single Action List in OF. So I'm thinking I'll use OF as part of my review process, but not to work from (I work better from paper). I use iCal for my calendar-type things.<br><br>I go back to work today. I teach high school math. My day is very structured. :) I look forward to setting up a separate notebook there. I'm thinking that I'll use a composition book. I know I'll scribble more and I want the increased size. Plus, I have a few so I don't mind giving it a try 'for free' and moving to something else if necessary.  <br><br>I found that any of my 'buy X' tasks tend to make me have an excuse to run out and get X when I'd be better off doing that another time. This is not because of the rules of SF but because I use shopping as an excuse not to do other things. If I think of something, I'll write it on my SF list because I'm often not sure if I'll go buy it or purchase it online. If I find it's a 'go buy it' task, I'll put it on a separate list. I will probably go back to some kind of software for this, but for now my bigger items are on a separate page in my home Moleskin and my grocery-type items are on a post it on the first page of it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2011 at 14:03 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Malisa:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I found that any of my 'buy X' tasks tend to make me have an excuse to run out and get X when I'd be better off doing that another time.
