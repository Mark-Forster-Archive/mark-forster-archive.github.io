I was thinking about going back to it but cycling through my Will Do list in the AF fashion. Thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 September 2009 at 23:17 | Pete Parker</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree entirely.  To be honest, looking at all of the tasks I have to do or am considering doing on several pages is overwhelming to my senses and results in me getting stuck in the mud instead of making progress.  With DIT I can chunk it down and say "this is what today is" instead of having it be a free flow list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 September 2009 at 8:45 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I should add that a lot of these systems are doing something that doesn't get much play here, at least that I've seen:  it is all about dealing with your perception of timelines.  Some folks work best in one day increments, knowing what they'll do in a day, and some work best when the tasks are 2-3 weeks away or even longer and are unbothered by a large list of to-dos.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 September 2009 at 8:48 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have been experimenting with running AF4 as specified, except that I use the rules to pick out 9 tasks at the start of the day that are my objectives for that day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 September 2009 at 10:18 | David C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>TK,<br><br>I found your perception interesting.  I too have had bouts of being overwhelmed by great numbers of tasks.  That is one reason I put my task filter in place (to delete immediately any task I did not intend to do this week).  But your observation struck me as something different.  The glut of tasks bothered me because they were "in the way".  IOW, they would not get done so they just clutter and I had to read over them each time to realize that they would not get done.  That messed me up.<br><br>What you are saying here is that the NUMBER of tasks bothers you?  I had not thought about that aspect of it.  Strangely, I don't have that feeling.  Something about AF4 allows me to see the tasks one at a time.  Granted, when I read over the list in the morning to get a handle on what may be lurking there, it does seem onerous ;-)  But I feel that the problem may be that I am not used to it yet.  I watched Mark go through his list several times and I can imagine that if I get to that point of quick flow through the list it will not feel as if dragons be there ;-)  I think the key (or at least what I am striving to achieve) is to develop a more "narrow focus" on the list.  IOW, save the broad view for the morning review and while working during the day, focus on one task, then the next then the next ... following the rules strictly.<br><br>I'm not there yet, but I have a feeling that it is the right way to go.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 September 2009 at 11:33 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I get more done with AF4 than I did with DIT.<br><br>It all depends on your work situation. If mine were very structured, with few interruptions, I might stick with DIT. But mine is highly variable. Some days are very intense, with urgent stuff flying at me at a rapid rate. Other days I have hours at a stretch of discretionary time. I like the flexibility of AF4. DIT couldn't accomodate the unpredictability of my days.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 September 2009 at 17:19 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi moises,<br><br>I must admit, I do miss the structure of DIT.  My work too is a lot like yours in that some days, I don't have as many meetings and I used to like to work off of a focused, closed list.  But in GTD parlance, the other type of work we have is what comes our way, somedays...well...many of my days....throughout the day and much of it requiring action either immediately or that same day.  I remember being amused sometimes at how many new tasks that I would have to add at the bottom of my closed list because of this!  My biggest problem with DIT was that I could never seem to keep up....the 3-5 day norm and if you did not get "all" of your work done, then it went on the backlog.  I had backlogs on a regular basis.<br><br>AF4 seems to be much better for me and I can say here now that I am finding it to be BY FAR the BEST version of AF yet!!<br><br>-David<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 September 2009 at 22:05 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting discussion, and I can relate to the comments made: Maybe it's the way my brain's been wired but I cannot seem to sustain a long open list for more than a week or so. I just find it quite overwhelming, and I get very tired constantly passing through the list to choose an item. <br><br>Moreover I always seem to have the urge to move onto the next task after a few minutes rather than allowing myself space to get into the flow of the task. For this reason I also miss DIT - yet AF4 seems far more intuitive and flexible than DIT. What is a time management neurotic like me to do? Any suggestions?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 September 2009 at 8:21 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Use AF4 timeboxed within DIT?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 September 2009 at 9:59 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have been using MArk's system for 2-3 years now using GED, DIT &amp; AFs 1-4 and here is where I am up to<br><br>I have found that the way I use AF4 varies precisely because the sheer quantity of tasks I have to keep moving can be overwhelming.  However a main benefit of af4 is that nothing gets missed because I write down those things that could be done.  Because I keep all my pages in an archive file, I know I can go back and recapture possibilities from before.<br><br>I took Mark's concept of "Daily Tasks" which was in one of the books, and have changed it to 48 hour tasks - tasks that I know need done regularly so that my work keeps flowing. To myself I call this "sweeping the runway" - concorde sadly crashed because someone did not make sure the runway was swept and eventually it caught up with them.  I keep this separate because it is 28 tasks that I do not want to manually enter into AF4.  I may time limit the length of time to do my 48 hour tasks in which case any left undone go into the active AF4 list<br><br>Secondly I run through AF 4.  I have three ways I do this: standard; with highlighting; with closed lists:<br>When time is very tight I go through the AF 4 list and create a closed list on the right hand side of my final page.  I focus on these tasks using the timing system I learnt from Mark until time runs out or I think I have done enough then I put them to the end of the active list.  I use a computer timer or online timer to keep me on track.<br><br>When I feel the need to rationally plan at the beginning of the day, I may go through my AF4 list with a highlighter underlining anything that has been slipping using standard AF4 and cycle through those once.  This means that I focus on the tasks and don't reflect on the whole list in that cycle.  This can be a relief on occasion!<br><br>Other times, like today I do AF4 as standard which includes reading this forum.<br><br>Finally, if I find a lot of tasks relating to one theme I may turn it into a project.  A project goes in CAPITALS in my AF4 system and then I have a separate section of my notebook for projects.  When running through AF4 I treat a project as a normal entry.  When I reach a project I may use any of the approaches above.  I may also schedule time to work on particular projects.<br><br>Finally, in my notebook I have a third section for notes.<br><br>When I have completed a page I do not chuck it but file it as often there is useful info there.<br><br>I like the fact that Mark's approach is experimental.  It encourages us to work it out as we go along and to keep adjusting.  He is less of a parent telling all those who need to learn : "Do it this way, dummy" but he is more of a coach suggesting things for us to use and work on.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 September 2009 at 13:46 | Mike Jones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:  Yes, it is very definitely the NUMBER of tasks or objectives that bothers me and bogs me down.  For whatever reason, when I see a list like that I feel like I have to do it all at once-a habit I've tried to break but that's just the way I'm wired, so I'm more successful if I chunk it down.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 17:59 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike Jones:  thanks for sharing your method.  I may adopt some of your ideas.  The key thing for everyone I'd say is to try it and if it doesn't work after a fixed amount of time, change it until you find something that does work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 18:02 | TK</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
