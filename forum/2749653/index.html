Comments welcome! <br><br>The broad approach is that (a bit like Seraphim) I want to include elements of short/no-list systems, which for me bring focus and energy, and also a long list / seedbed approach, which I need to keep track of everything over a period.  Here it is: <br><br>I keep all my work tasks on a simple Word document.  Working down from the top, there are several sections:<br><br>1. Today’s date and a short list of tasks intended for action today.  <br>This can be freely added to at any time.  <br><br>2. Completed items section, to drag and drop (or write) tasks into as they are done. <br>This I like to paste into a Completed items diary at the end of the day, as I find it helpful to be able to look back over what was done when.  So, this section starts each day empty. <br><br>3. A short list of repeating items to be copied into the day section each morning, eg check calendars for forthcoming period (incl my wife’s!), check all yesterday’s emails and meeting notes have been processed, review list as below. <br><br>4. A long list of tasks.  New items can be added to the top as they arise.  This gets reviewed every morning at minimum, and items that stand out are moved into the brief action list at the top. If day items are not cleared (I try to avoid this, but unexpected things do come up), they are moved back to the top of the long list at the end of the day. Items that are not moving for any reason show themselves by gravitating towards the bottom. <br><br>And that’s it!  It’s working well for me (I seem to be clearing away a backlog for the first time in a while), I’m appreciating the short focused list, a bit like the will-do list in DIT, as well as the catch-all option to track things that may take longer to come to the fore (or be dropped).  Not sure how similar to Seraphim’s Serial No-List this is, if it is it’s an accident!  Plan is now to continue for a period (a non-Lent challenge) and track how it goes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 September 2019 at 12:50 | Colin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like your system. I am fascinated by the format of one text file for a very long time now. (In fact I am tinkering on a very similar system myself.)<br><br>I like your departments, but I am not sure if the constant shuffling around of tasks doesn't turn out to be too much of an overhead in the long run.<br><br>Also reviewing your long list every morning sounds unrealistic to me. I know I couldn't do it.<br><br>How do you deal with tasks that you want to work on multiple times per day?<br><br>Do you use an "algorithm" to travel the today list?<br><br>I like your "journaling" section, it's a very cool way of marking things as done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 September 2019 at 23:03 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Christopher.  The system has evolved partly out of listing my worst work habits, considering what their opposites would look like and adapting my ways of working to suit (as recommended by Mark). <br><br>I must admit the daily review of the full list is more aspiration than routine as yet, though it is needed as I'm looking to strengthen the habit of being properly on top of everything. <br><br>I find the moving of tasks very quick and easy (quicker than crossing out and rewriting), and with a short list of immediate tasks I only need to do it as they are completed.  If it's something I need to keep coming back to I just keep it on the day list till it's done. <br><br>I don't use an algorithm to travel the today list, I find "standing out" works really well. <br><br>Yes the document of dates and tasks completed is a really handy reference!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2019 at 15:34 | Colin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If you're using Word for Windows, a very quick way to move paragraphs up and down is to click inside the paragraph, press Alt+Shift+up arrow or down arrow. Apart from Ctrl+S and Ctrl+Z, it's the combo I use most often in my day job as a tech writer.<br><br>That key combo also works for moving rows up and down inside a table. MUCH easier than cut and paste.<br><br>I like the idea of this hybrid document very much. If you give each section head a style of Heading 1 (or whatever heading level suits you), you can use the Navigation Pane on the View tab to quickly hop around inside the document.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2019 at 16:48 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Colin wrote:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Not sure how similar to Seraphim’s Serial No-List this is, if it is it’s an accident!  &gt;&gt;<br><br>It seems very close!<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; 4. A long list of tasks. New items can be added to the top as they arise. This gets reviewed every morning at minimum, and items that stand out are moved into the brief action list at the top. &gt;&gt;<br><br>If you change this rule slightly, it will be very close indeed.  <br><br>First, instead of reviewing every morning, you could do it like this: cycle through the Today section over and over till nothing stands out.  Then take a single pass through the Long List and either take action on tasks, or copy them to the Today section.  <br><br>Second, if there is anything left over in the Today section at the end of the day, you could just move it to the top of the Long List for later processing, and start the next day fresh with a new Today section.<br><br>These two changes would make it pretty much identical to Serial No-List, unless I am missing something.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2019 at 0:57 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike: Thanks very much for the shortcut tip re moving paras up and down.  I love it!  On a Mac it is Ctrl Shift Up or Down, and as you say is much easier than cut and paste.  This is my new favourite shortcut. <br><br>Seraphim: That's really helpful too, and the changes suggested are more or less what I have been doing at times - I'll have to have a proper read of the Serial No-List discussion, it's clearly all very relevant to this system.  I might need a different name though, maybe No-List+Long-List.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2019 at 16:28 | Colin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello all! Is anyone familiar with WorkFlowy? (https://workflowy.org) - it's free for up to 500 items per month (which is plenty!) and functions much like the single Word document, only all of the sections are collapsible. I highly recommend it!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 October 2019 at 23:32 | Carrie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Carrie,<br><br>I higly recommend checkvist.com (same prinicple as workflowy)<br><br>In the free verison far more than 500 items possible and a hell lot of keyboard shortcuts at your service. E.g. you can duplicate a task, move it to the end of the list and jump back where you left  simply by pressing CTRL+D, CTRL+END, G+'arrow left' - That's it.<br><br>Fits perfectly for AF, FVP, RAF and so forth.<br><br>IMHO the perfect alternative to pen and paper...<br><br>Drawback: IMHO the app for smartphones is, let's say very basic...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 October 2019 at 11:32 | jens</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Familiar with Workflowy but jumped onto DynaList in its place.
