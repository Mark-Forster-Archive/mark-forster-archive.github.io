Once you get on a roll, you kind of know what has to be done.

The difference is in how one approaches that list, whether it's paper, electronic, or in one's head. No system is for everyone. But your system appears to be effective for most of us! Please rejoice in the criticism as it's a sign of success. No one bothers to criticize someone who isn't doing anything big. It also seems as if the critics haven't tried AF. These are the types who want something so complex that it seems genius. True genius is simplicity. You're on to something big! So study if you must (as a psychologist trained in research, I feel compelled to also), but know that your instincts are right on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 15:16 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Don't be stung.  The original beta-testers were probably people who are already familiar with your counsel.  New folks coming over from Lifehacker are going to have no background knowledge to "get" the system right away.  If they try it--and follow the directions--then they'll get it.  The only thing you can do is to keep being awesome and explaining why it works.  Maybe you could offer to go on a "blog tour" to be interviewed and answer questions about AF on other productivity blogs to better get the word out.  Not so much to promote the system but to frame and define it the way you'd like.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 15:23 | Jim (Atlanta)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well, I love this AF "Rolls Royce" too. (I mean, a Porsche is just a glorified car? sheesh) I also admit that I "use" AF without the AF list too! In other words, not sure how to put this, but it has also changed what I do "off-list" which helps just as much as what I do ON-list, and I've considered that part of the (common sense?) "AF magic" from the beginning. <br><br>(Mel, I really liked your list as to why AF works on the other thread. On an ordinary "to-do" list I would never allow myself to cross anything off the list until it was DONE, which was rather demotivating at times... )</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 16:02 | Bev</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I just added a comment to Lifehacker, but I guess it's awaiting moderation, because I still don't see it (hope it didn't evaporate).  My comment addressed some of the naysayer comments, based on my experience with AF.  <br><br>Right now, the Lifehacker item has gotten 22,966 views.  Worry about a handful of naysayers (what fraction of views resulted in naysaying comments)?  Nah.  If it spurs you to push out the frontier?  Sure, why not.  <br><br>I haven't kept up with any Lifehacker fallout comments on this site, so I don't know about that yet.  But, I'll bet that's a small number too compared to how many have come to the site.  You did say "stung by a couple of people commenting."

And I've been using the system since Day One. Unfortunately I didn't mean it to read it was 'only' a to-do list, but anybody who starts of with "Hi, I don't mean to be incendiary..." is obviously looking to start a flame war IMO. Actually, I thought pretty much everybody was going to ignore the thread.

I found this initially with routine tasks, that whereas I had started by listing them, once I had gotten into a pattern, or AF had prompted me to change the way in which I did them for some reason, it just seemed unnecessary or inappropriate to return them to my lists.  However, every so often it feels the right things to do to put them back for a while.<br><br>I am now starting to find that a lot of my project tasks are "wandering off" as well.  Initially I would do something on a project and readd it to the end of my list, but I have been so prompted to overhaul my project management system that virtually all of my projects have temporarily placed themselves within my project management system awaiting review.  I have regular tasks to review my system, which is picking up anything that has any degree of urgency, and any project related individual tasks are still within my lists.  I have no doubt that those projects will return to the lists in due course when the time is right, and I am totally confident that nothing is being missed, but at the moment they are not in my list as such, although are indirectly through my "review project management" task.<br><br>AF is becoming in a way the glue that holds everything together - but without it - no way!
