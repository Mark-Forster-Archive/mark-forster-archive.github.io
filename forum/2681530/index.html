As it says. Enough to remind me what I want to do, maybe even a bit more detail, such as "vacuum living room; Jan did behind furniture on north wall; Feb east". (I prefer a diary of what I did, since that doesn't change. My plans, however, change often.)<br><br>Date last done. When I see "vacuum living room", I know how long it's really been. I sometimes get optimistic. Vacuum again in one month! Due date arrives, then passes, and eventually I wonder how long it's been. This way, it's right in front of me, waiting patiently.<br><br>Date due (or tickler date). This one takes a bit of math, but not too much. If it's due in a week, include the day name, and my best guess of the date. If it's due in 6 weeks, that's close enough to 1 month plus 15 days. If in doubt, set it a few days early. As the date gets closer, and the correct calendar page is in front of you, correct it.<br><br>If I want extra notice, so you can set aside time to do the task by the due date, I use the tickler date instead of due date. You could add a symbol, but I don't find it necessary.<br><br>Flag. An extra column for dots or symbols or highlighting. Especially useful if I need to focus on only the highest priorities for a week.<br><br>Use:<br><br>When planning, look down the Due (tickler) column.<br><br>As you do something, cross it off, and write the next occurrence on the next empty row.<br><br>Eventually, the page will only have a few active tasks, most of which aren't due for a long time. Copy those to the next empty rows, and throw out the old page.<br><br>Benefits:<br><br>No need to change calendar page when I want to write something down.<br><br>Record of how long it has really been.<br><br>More room than a calendar to include details. Can use more than one line for a task.<br><br>Simple layout. Lined paper, possibly in a Bullet Journal, rather than calendar grid.<br><br>Handles any length of repeat.<br><br>Robust. No need to check old calendar pages in case I forgot one. No pressure to do things just to turn the calendar page.<br><br>Quick to check. All on one (or two) pages.<br><br>As much room as needed for multiple tasks due on the same day, without wasting space on days with nothing due.<br><br>Variations:<br><br>Move things due in several months to the top of the next page. This puts them in a block that I can ignore for now.<br><br>Move things due in several months to several pages down the book. Not worth the effort.<br><br>Sub-columns for Due date, perhaps one per month or per season. This makes it faster to scan, since you only need to look at rows with something in that sub-column.<br><br>Spreadsheet. I didn't stick with this, but it was easy enough to set up. I added a column for "days between," and let it calculate the next due date. Then I sorted by due date. Then I added a column for task type, and sorted by that as well, and it lost the simplicity of pen and paper.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2017 at 20:50 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree about Date Last Done. That really is what it all comes down to!<br><br>A long time ago, I bought OmniFocus and set it up in a ridiculously elaborate fashion. The only part that survived was the recurring tasks, and they still run beautifully. I keep wanting to get rid of it, because I have a very old version that I don't want to upgrade, and it is yet another app in the mix. Too bad it's so darn convenient! It is basically your system but digital. Every item has a nice big comment box where I can keep a log of what's happening, last time it was done, things to remember for next time, etc. It gives me a great readout of the upcoming due dates, and it has no trouble with overdue tasks. They simply go at the top of the list in red.<br><br>I bought Scrivener (and love it), hoping it might replace OmniFocus (that would be a joke in general, but not the way *I* use OmniFocus). Scrivener has turned out to be a really great environment for taking notes and organizing them, but its date support is too primitive. So now I have all info and notes in Scrivener, with OmniFocus running as the due-date engine, containing lots of links to Scrivener items. Some day I will get out of OmniFocus completely; maybe there's a way to rig up your table in Scrivener. It does a spreadsheet-like column view. Hmmm.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 July 2017 at 7:19 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Comment boxes with details reminds me of a system I tried, that failed. A separate index card, and in a later attempt page in a binder, per task (or group of tasks). The index cards were sorted by date I next wanted to do them. That was very difficult to keep up if I wanted to see just the truly important tasks, and had to look through each card. It was a bit better with larger pages and groups of tasks, but not much.<br><br>When my system crashed, I found remembered the details well enough. Every few days, I clean a kitchen shelf, the one that stands out most. (One shelf, in one cupboard, or even one side of one shelf--it's a Little-and-Often project, and when it's done, it will be time to start over.) The ones that get used more often, and therefore dirty faster, get cleaned more often. The rarely-used ones get cleaned rarely, usually when I want to put something new on them. No need for a detailed plan, or even a detailed record. (The thickness of the dust is the record!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 July 2017 at 21:11 | Cricket</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
