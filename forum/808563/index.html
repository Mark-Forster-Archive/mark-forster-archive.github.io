Of course time in itself is not manageable; we all have the same amount of hours in a week.

If I've predetermined my meal selection, then I needn't look at the menu.  Other times, I want the menu to make a fresh decision.  Even then, I've still must chose THIS meal.  I don't have all my future meal selections ordered in a queque.  I'll plan some of the meals I'm going to cook........but I also like spontaneous choices as well.  I've only chosen eating as an example.  The same goes for anything...people, books, my new current initiative, when I'll go to the dentist......Life is a mixture of pre-determined selections and spontaneous selections.  That's part of the fun of it!<br>re: time management vs processing work....please re-read my above post.  I know of no other way to explain the difference.  Example:  I've scheduled a time block  at 2 to 4 pm for project X(time management).  I used my work system to decide to work on project X  to completion rather than begin project Z before it's completed.  (Of course, this is only an example.

The commitments, of course, come first.  But....but....but.....my ABILITIES can't be predermined because the pain levels can't be predicted.  It also plays havoc with my brain damage.......pain also fractures focus.  I AIM for a normal planned session of work, but, alas, I'm forced to choose what I'm able to do at the time.  My weekly format helps immensely in this regard.  Before I was disabled, the weekly format was great mostly for surprise oppurtunities and burning inspirations.  Now it's mostly a framework for my unreliable brain and body.  Somehow, I still maintain it....with an open-mind and a flexible attitude. I try my BEST to follow the given format (shedule and habits combos) as closely as I'm able.  Adding to this, when my pain levels are more "merciful", I still need to split that time between work and pleasure.   I'm like a cat on a hot tin roof!

Today, my neck and shoulder feel like someone is pumping boiling grease out of my spinal cord and it's running down my left scapula!  I feel GRATEFUL that I finished Friday Accounts day round-up on Monday as, today,....there's no way I can crunch numbers with any accuracy.  Hell, even time references disappear without hard focus......I don't CARE that it's the 19th day of June in the year 2009....all I care about is doing the best I can 5 minutes at a time for a maximum of 90 minutes.  The drugs don't help either.  Now I'm both stupified and suffering!  LOL!  This is a great day for lowest level house chores.....but....but....but......it could all change.  The unpredictable pain levels are both vexing and a blessing!  LOL!  I'm PRAYING for a pain level change ASAP!  LOL!  LOL!   LOL!   When the pain levels are more merciful, I jump on my opportunities like it's a gift from heaven............yet.....in the back of my mind, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.......ROTFL!   On the bright side, it's taught me how to spontaneously strategize! while staying firm with my weekly output /accomplishments aims.  LOL!  I may be a mess but I'm somehow making the grade.
