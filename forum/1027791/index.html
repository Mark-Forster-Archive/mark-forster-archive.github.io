I'm not experiencing any pressure to do my tasks. By chance, most of them are not urgent, and not particularly fun, pretty gray tasks, but important nonetheless.<br>The thing is, I'm having a WHOLE month, so I don't feel the need to work on them. And I should!<br>The same goes for re-entered tasks. I work a little, and then I have a full week until I pick it up again.<br><br>I really like the concept of DWM, but I feel that it should be more demanding. I remember the pressure of AF2. It was a race! I know... I didn't let a month pass, but I have the feeling that it won't be much different.<br><br>Did anybody try to use, lets say: two weeks for new tasks, and three days for those that were re-entered?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Walter</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 February 2010 at 20:09 | Walter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; I'm not experiencing any pressure to do my tasks&gt;&gt;<br><br>Do you believe if the deadline was altered, the pressure would be enough of a motivator? At the end of the day, you can still ignore the system and do whatever you like. <br><br>&lt;&lt;not urgent, and not particularly fun, pretty gray tasks, but important nonetheless&gt;&gt;<br><br>Sounds like a recipe for procrastination. When I have too many of these, my emphasis shifts from my system to my life goals. Of course, major events (birth, death, illness, etc) throw wrenches into the best of plans, providing many "not particularly fun, pretty gray tasks, but important nonetheless" to content with. <br><br>&lt;&lt;The same goes for re-entered tasks. I work a little, and then I have a full week until I pick it up again.&gt;&gt;<br><br>I'm finding the 7 day threat provides enough of a threat to keep working. Moreover, if a honking chunk of tasks appear as "due today", I know I'm taking on too much. <br><br>&lt;&lt;I feel that it should be more demanding&gt;&gt;<br><br>I felt the same way at the 2 wk mark. <br><br>&lt;&lt;Did anybody try to use, lets say: two weeks for new tasks, and three days for those that were re-entered?&gt;&gt;<br><br>Walter, at the end of the day, we really should strive to have tasks/projects on our lists that represent "the best in us". The deadlines serve as anchors, but really that's all they are. If you have a chunk of new projects/tasks that you haven't touched in 29 days, you might want to consider where you're time/energy is going. <br><br>Best of luck.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 February 2010 at 20:43 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum,<br><br>"Do you believe if the deadline was altered, the pressure would be enough of a motivator?

If a task's do-something-by date is 30 days out, I may make a decision NOT to do anything on it because I know if I tackle it and don't finish, then I have only SEVEN days to get back to it. If I let it ride at the 30-day, then maybe when It's down to 14 days, I'll think about it. To me, it almost seems like a punishment to work on far out items (time-wise) since my next time-frame is much shorter. I'm still trying to follow the system as is, though, for a few more months.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2010 at 4:10 | TerriC</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Not feeling pressure is a bad thing? <br><br>The world sometimes needs your help; most of the time it doesn't.

And you probably are unable to hear the needs of those that require your help due to your desire to cling to your fantasies.<br><br>Why not choose any AF and stick with it no matter the anxiety or "problems" for six months. No hacks, no tweaks etc. I assure you the world will not end (at least not due to your commitment).<br><br>Or just be honest that you will forever cling to the ideas that you have held onto forever about your importance and the amount of work you need to do, no matter how miserable you are. <br><br>Write down for your largest project: continual frustration punctuated by brief hope of change when some promising system comes along which I will abandon once significant changes begins to occurs.<br><br>Or you could just give up on your fantasies and commit yourself to a gentle discipline for a while and see what happens.

If they are really important, take courage and choose one important task, create a file, write a title, save it, and move on.

It doesn't matter what you choose to act on (unless you think it does in which case choose what matters).  Just take two minutes, activate one task, and move on.  Problem solved.

You sound a lot like American Idol's Simon Cowell. Like you, he would most likely deny making personal attacks. Yet, his comments sometimes are very cutting. Do you agree that you don't have to say, "Hey you, you're an idiot" to hurt people's feelings? <br><br>I'm a psychologist and I sometimes had to speak painful truths to my clients. The difference here is no one is paying you to tell it to them straight. It sounds like you do have some fans here who like your straight talk, however. You certainly don't have to take my advice (lol), but I find that asking questions to help people realize the truth accomplishes the same purpose without any hard feelings. I remember Mark asking me once why I had a problem with dismissal for AF1. He didn't say, "I don't get it," or "Words, words, words" which really would have come across to me as "You're an idiot." Instead, he enabled me to say that to myself. LOL <br><br>And rather than say "good luck" which can come across on this medium as sarcastic, I say best wishes, Norman.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2010 at 1:57 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hmmm...<br><br>I've re-read all Norman's posts on this thread and for the life of me I can't understand what people are getting upset about.

For me, 30 days is enough time to either get started on a task or come to terms with the fact that it's not important enough to me to work on.  It's also enough pressure to encourage me to work on things I don't really want to but need to--without being so much that I ignore everything.<br><br>It does sound to me, from what I've read on the board, like DWMs pressure generally feels less than AFs, and that different people like whichever one they like because the pressure fits them best.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2010 at 13:22 | Jessica</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Walter: It worked in a somewhat opposite way for me. I did have a bunch of tasks at the 1 month mark when switching over from AF. At first, there wasn't much pressure. As I started facing some dismissals on the one week mark, the pressure was there and a couple of times, I *had* to dismiss tasks I didn't really want to dismiss. But I kept to the rules.<br><br>That is when I realised that there could be a couple things happening: either I was probably doing tasks that were far more important that those I dismissed, or I was procrastinating and letting things slip. It was a useful mental audit.<br><br>So, after that first hit, I now have developed an internal habit of trying not to bunch up too many tasks on the one week and one month mark. I try to complete or partially complete them, so they are constantly moving in my calendar. <br><br>Overally therefore, I would say the pressure is certainly there, but it took some time to develop.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2010 at 13:24 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel: Projection</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2010 at 13:56 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>re: Norman U.<br><br>Content: Bang-on... something I need to hear. <br>Style: I'd probably decline a coffee date.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2010 at 14:47 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Walter, I again I don't understand the problem with dismissal with either AF or DWM.

The dismissal mechanisms of the AFs tended to be erratic. The AF rules created situations where items could remain open for very short or very long time periods. DWM solves all that.<br><br>I know that, except for David Drake, I am probably the only regular participant here who thinks there was much good in GTD. Back in the day, pre-DIT, when I would roam David Allen's forum, there were constant discussions about what to put on the list. This was never specified in Allen's books. Some people would say that only stuff that would be actioned within the next week should be allowed.<br><br>I used to review my GTD list every week. And some stuff would sit there literally for years. And I am not talking about "Someday/Maybes" either. <br><br>GTD got me from undisciplined to sort-of disciplined. Each of Mark's successive systems--DIT, AF, DWM--have allowed me to strengthen my discipline a bit more. The leap from the AFs to DWM was bigger than that between any of the AFs.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2010 at 19:43 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>moises,<br><br>I loved GTD too and had the exact same problem with items sitting there forever. <br><br>Where I thik GTD got it wrong was the theory that if you break everything down into next actions, (and review them weekly) things won't sit on your list.

Furthermore, I think that Mark's Little and Often Principle preserves the tiny kernel of truth that lies within Allen's "next physical action" notion.<br><br>Where Allen went wrong was in requiring me to WRITE down the next physical action. Where Mark went right was in requiring me to DO any physical action (as in the paradigmatic "I'll just open the project folder").<br><br>My problem with Allen was that how I describe an action changes all the time. If I am charging forward and energized, I will say to myself "I am going to start writing this proposal." If I am anxious and fearful, I might say "I'll reread my notes from the last meeting." The point with L&amp;O is that I can just write on my list "XYZ project" and as long as I do some physical action, I have (a) overcome inertia and started work on the project, and (b) I get the reward of being able to mark the item as done and the concomitant good feeling of knowing that I have moved the project forward.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2010 at 21:44 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman,<br><br>"Why not see if they stand out and let them go if they don't?" <br><br>Interesting idea. I find that what stands out varies hugely depending on mood and pressure. If I've spent all day in meetings, I find that very little will stand out - otherwise I simply wouldn't get through the list. Similarly, if I have a major issue coming up, anything between my current task and actions to fix the issue is going to struggle to get my attention.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2010 at 22:01 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It works, Norman!

The discipline of AF or DWM encourages progress, which is satisfying at one level .  But at the higher level, you have to have the right things in the system in the first place, and they have to 'stand out' at least as much as the 'ought to' tasks which can divert time and energy instead.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2010 at 20:13 | Jane P</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Janep,<br><br>I always thought that one of the nice things about the system is that you don't need to have the right things in: it sorts them out for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2010 at 20:18 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman,<br><br>"Why not see if they stand out and let them go if they don't?"<br><br>What you're saying is that instead of using the dismissing as a motivator to works on tasks that were sitting for some time, just use it to let them go?<br><br>Walter<br><br>---------------------<br><br>Umm yes and no.

For some reason people are afraid of letting go of tasks they just are not doing. The salient question is why? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>You may disagree, but I don't think it's just a neurotic resistance to letting things go.  There's more to it than that, at least for me.<br><br>For some tasks, it's not a problem letting them go.  They were usually hare-brained ideas in the first place, or I am just not committed to them.   These aren't the ones facing expiration, at least not for me.  After seeing these kinds of tasks on my list repeatedly for several days, I realize I don't need to do them, don't want to do them, am not going to do them, and just delete them.  <br><br>A few of them really do stay around and end up "expiring", but by far most of the tasks facing expiration are not that kind of task.  Rather, they are tasks associated with some kind of commitment, and if I just let the task expire, then I am reneging on that commitment.  This is not acceptable to me.  If I am going to back out of a commitment, then I need to do that explicitly, and also work it out with any other people that may be involved.  It can affect my wife, my family, my coworkers, my boss, etc.  <br><br>Also, tasks of this kind don't have any problem "standing out" for me.  The problem is just that there are too many of them, and not enough hours in the day.  <br><br>More than any of the AF variations, DWM is helping me identify this kind of thing.  It is helping me realize what is getting in the way of meeting some of those commitments; to see what will really be required to meet them; and forcing me to decide what to drop, or at least what to re-think.<br><br>The AF1 dismissal process didn't really help with this -- my AF list just kept growing and growing.  As time went on, the number of open tasks never really went down.  I did lots of work, got lots of things done, but couldn't keep up with all the new things I needed to do.  AF4 helped with that a little, but every time I started a new "closed list" it was longer than the previous one -- and never shorter than 5 or 6 pages.  <br><br>The DWM "space invaders" marching forward every day really helps me see how much is on my plate and how much I have over-committed -- in this way, DWM is very much like DIT but much more flexible.  Also, seeing what kinds of things are expiring and thinking about why, is giving me lots of ideas for improving my systems for handling my work, not just re-thinking my commitments.  <br><br>Anyway, that's how it's working for me, and it's great!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2010 at 22:43 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman,<br><br>"I will not engage in too much word mincing, pop-psych, or circumlocutions to accommodate the someone's possible fragile sensibilities."<br><br>My dear mama used to tell me to call a spade a spade, but not a bloody shovel.<br><br>(My archaeologist chum got very upset about this, pointing out at some length the differences in design and use of these very different implements.
