I'm working on a new system!" thread it looks like there might be a few of us working to a deadline with our tax returns.<br>I like the five minutes everyday rule - although am yet to do it.  I suffer from being unable to make myself sit down everyday and do routine paperwork, like my tax return and business records. I know I need to address this to make life run more smoothly.  I have been successful in setting up some systems to keep on top of some systems, so I know there is hope.  It is because I work from home, have 3 lively boys and no day is ever the same!  As a childminder I get up at 6am to receive children at 6.30, so finding time in the morning is tricky - by the evening I am shattered and forget to do it!<br>One tip I would like to share with you which I found helpful years ago and run without fail every tax year is to have on my shelf 12 A4/foolscap manilla envelopes labelled individually April 2010, May 2010 etc for the whole year.  Any business paperwork gets filed straight into the relevant month - invoices, receipts, orders, notes, statements everything goes in there.  Which does make the tax return easier, Mike - I think you mentioned time spent digging out the paperwork, this is what prompted this thread.<br>It also makes finding paperwork easier as it is stored in the relevant month.  I am hoping that even if I don't do 5 mins a day - dealing with one months paperwork isn't that bad and doesn't take too long - so why can't I even to that???<br>Hope this may help some of you out there :-)<br>Look forward to hearing any other tips you use to make the process easier.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2010 at 13:16 | Stephanie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I also have trouble getting my paper done.  However I keep all my business papers in a lever arch file and file under the following headings:<br><br>Bank<br>Business Credit Card<br>VAT<br>Invoices<br>Receipts<br>and so on<br><br>Then I file everything in the right section in date order with the most recent on the top.  I then create a spreadsheet for each year.  One one sheet I have all my invoices listed with the dates I invoiced and the date paid, on another sheet my 'cash book' which is a list of everything I have paid out and what is was for and the gross and net figures (for VAT purposes), another sheet has a VAT calculator into which I can plug the necessary figures and it tells me what to put onto the VAT form and how much I owe.<br><br>All this goes to my accountant once a year for him to prepare annual accounts and he does my tax as well.  I'm useless with figures and don't trust myself to do my tax return as I would surely get it wrong.  He can also advise me on any tax concessions I may be able to claim, and as he does my husbands as well he advises us on the best way to distribute out assets to make the most of tax allowances and so on.  I know I have to pay him, but I am paying for his experise rather than his bookkeeping as I do most of that myself.<br><br>Hope this helps.  It makes a huge different if at least all the papers are in the right place.  I'm getting better at this, but am no angel and often don't get around to fliing some stuff when I should do!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2010 at 13:30 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Stephanie,<br><br>Yes, that was my system as well, but it fell into disuse.  <br><br>I had it refined a bit more.  I would file ALL receipts by month, as you do, but then I would also mark the taxable ones and put them in a folder for taxes.  That actually got most of the paper where it should be for taxes in advance.  IOW, I did not even need to go through 12 envelopes at the end of the year.  At one time, I was using Quicken and stuff went in there so when the year was done, a press of the button moved everything into TurboTax.  This takes considerably more discipline, however.<br><br>As to tips:  If you take David Allen's advice seriously and empty your in-box daily into that monthly folder, you'll take less than five minutes a day.  Also, it really DOES pay to take a red pen and circle the date and the taxable amounts.  That way, if you look through 12 folders at the end of the year, you are just seeing red ;-)  But seriously, sometimes it is easy to forget that something is a taxable item.  You COULD go one step further and note the form the info goes on.  IOW, Sched A, Sched E, etc.  (Or maybe in your country "Charity", "Medical", etc.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2010 at 13:53 | Mike</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
