I'm afraid it will be deleted there, but also I like the thought and want to discuss it.  This is about what happens when work gets complex:<br><br><br>Just because things are getting very complicated in my life and I have be obliged by the events to come back very quickly to GTD even if SF was really my preferential system.<br><br>About SF, since I used it, I have noticed a strange experience (common with with AF1, AF4), it's the incredible increasement of my brain power but I must precise my thinking.<br><br>Working on tasks little by little without any link with my projects has a real impact on my thinking creativity. My brain find solution I could not imagine. Then, the system seems perfect for working on some topics or projects which are not too numerous or too complicated.<br><br>But when things are getting really complicated ie multiples projects, strategic decision, multiple action to do in the rush I notice that for me GTD is much better and make me more creative, efficient. GTD force me to be more creative and give me a better control than SF.<br><br>Then in a way, for me SF yes increase the brain power but the engine is intuition, heuristic scheme of tony Buzan increase brain power and the engine is creativity, GTD increase brainpower but is engine is rationality.<br><br>Anyway I realize at last that i am like a sailor on the sea. When the sea is quiet I am comfortable with SF, but when there is a terrible storm, juste like what happened for me about the last two weeks, nothing is better for me than GTD.<br><br>Life is never has simple as we imagine.<br>March 15, 2011 at 19:13 | Registered CommenterJupiter</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 March 2011 at 19:46 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Discussion:  I had the same feeling today.  Not about GTD per se, but about the need to review all the important things that need doing, and figure how they connect so I have an orderly scheme of how they should be tackled.  Only once I had untangled the complex threads of work did I feel comfortable actually tackling particular work elements.  It's the visually oriented creative planning that really helps.<br><br>Having done that, I can use the plan as one thing that I'll persistently work on within SF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 March 2011 at 19:49 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For me AF/SF is about Task Management.<br>Project, Time, Life Management are other monsters all together.<br><br>You want to eat through tasks at the speed of light; use AF/SF.<br><br>You want to have a vision of where you want to go; you need project management.<br><br>You want to make sure you have the time; use a calendar ;)<br><br>You want to be sure to balance your commitments; you need life management.<br><br>Anyway, what you get out of the other management disciplines are tasks big or small.

It's the visually oriented creative planning that really helps. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>I've run into that problem too.   I think one reason I'm more successful with SF than I was with AF (besides Column 2) is that I have better project management tactics now, and keep the PM separate from SF.  <br><br>Every time I look at an SF task, I like to be able to draw a mental line connecting it with its source -- the project that generated that task, or the fact that's it's a recurring maintenance item, or whatever.  I've become a lot better at that over the last two years, which keeps SF cleaner and sharper.<br><br>Funny, though, my reaction would be the opposite to Jupiter's, RE GTD -- I found that it sometimes worked OK when things were very smooth but it couldn't handle the slightest increases in workload or stress.   Under duress, I try even harder to stick to the SF method and rules, because it carries me through those stressful periods so well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 March 2011 at 1:47 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Erik has nailed it: SF excels at executing a series of tasks, period. When tasks are connected by projects, we reach a certain complexity that requires "project planning" in a separate system. I get by as long as possible with small notes, arrows, etc. within the SF page, but when a project outgrows that space, it goes into folders, computer documents, online bookmarks, etc. This still drives me crazy at times, and I could use better skills in this area.<br><br>I try to heed Mark Forster's advice, to manage each project with precisely the complexity it deserves, and no more. My prior GTD practice usually oscillated between project-management overkill (as I attempted to plug *every* item into the six horizons, etc.) and a cavalier under-management. Letting SF items grow into projects at their own pace strikes a much better balance for me.<br><br>One unexpected turn of events: though GTD had solidly converted me to the "next action" faith, and I still tend to enter SF items in the form "Project: Next action," I am stunned at how often I ignore this next action! Instead, when the project "stands out," a completely different action suggests itself, much better suited to my current "context" and all the latest developments. In GTD, I would probably not even be looking at this item, because it would be on the wrong context list, and when I would eventually see it, it would be phrased in such an out-of-date manner as to be a total non-starter. I think this is a major part of why my GTD lists stagnated so quickly (plus the fact that I rarely did those awful weekly reviews, ahem).<br><br>The next thing I need to improve is better connections between the SF tasks and my project support material. There are many places a project's "stuff" might be, and not much room in SF to write down a reference.<br><br>Here is my latest idea, which I hope to test soon:<br><br>Number or date each SF page in my notebook (when I first write on it). Then, whenever needed, create a folder (or a "document wallet" or any such thing) with a label matching this SF page. All those one-off scraps of paper, jotted index cards, tiny receipts, a booklet received in the mail, etc.—the stuff for which you can't bring yourself to make an entire "project folder" and which you would never want to store alphabetically—they go in this bin. If you're on this page, you're on this bin. Kind of like a tickler file, but for SF pages instead of dates. I hope it works!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 March 2011 at 3:00 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie: <br><br>&lt;&lt;I try to heed Mark Forster's advice, to manage each project with precisely the complexity it deserves, and no more.

I'd spend so much time developing the projects and arranging the projects and struggling to fit things I wanted to do into projects that I'd get frustrated and then I'd end up with a bunch of one-off/single action lists related to different AOFs, then I'd switch the AOF's to folders and on and on. <br><br>&lt;&lt;One unexpected turn of events: though GTD had solidly converted me to the "next action" faith, and I still tend to enter SF items in the form "Project: Next action," I am stunned at how often I ignore this next action! &gt;&gt;<br><br>I didn't start recording SF like this, but as I've used it over a number of weeks this has started happening organically. It seems to help items jump out from C1 for me better.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 March 2011 at 12:54 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just two topic I wrote to complete  About perspective. For me perspective is what we call in GTD LEVELS ie seeing globally the bigs rocks of every aspect of my life and decide. SF is not a global system. It is a specific task and action system. GTD is a global system includind control (what does perfectly SF in acting) and perspective replacing it system instead of contexts. <br><br>Now I feel more comfortable with GTD about the feeling of control because SF is un able now to give me all relatives tasks about a project or at a certain level the consequences of one task on a pre defined aim. But in action I admit that the system is incredibly addictive and it pull my intuition on the most important things to do at the right time. More it stop proscratrination. And this is important too. <br><br>But I also now that for my efficiency like you Rainer i often come back to GTD <br><br>I guess the better system for me would be to integrate SF RULES inside GTD RULES. I almost succeed. It is possible on paper. So I guess it may be possible on digital.<br><br>Also, as Melisa I love omnifocus. I is such a great and easy software which make indeed easy the making of projects. But for me if it is perfect for project it is un easy with contexts. I tried make it like  superfocus on my note book but I Fell. <br><br>The only way I conciliated the two system (ie GTD on Omnifocus and Superfocus on my paper note book) was to report some task each day from OF to SF but it doesnt work very well for the present time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 March 2011 at 16:35 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I too bought OmniFocus and have used it for several years. Like Jupiter, I use it mainly in Project view and have rarely ever made the Context view work for me (partly because I work from home, so practically everything is Home context). The one context that does work great is Errands—very, very useful. Other than that, I leave the "Due Date" view open all the time, and it has become my "urgent" filter.<br><br>Like mailsa, I found OmniFocus to be a huge time sink, inviting me to over-organize all my Next Actions and Next-Next-Actions, and construct intricate chains using those serial/parallel arrows ... only to find the whole thing outdated rather quickly. I realize this is not OmniFocus' fault, but hey, it's what happens when I use that tool.<br><br>After my first week with SF, I thought (like Jupiter): this is a great way to run my GTD action lists! But, as I got more used to the "standing out" and "sifting" phenomena, I decided SF is far more than a way to run action lists. For single tasks, it replaces the whole GTD action chain from inbox to clarifying to next action, without a single Weekly Review. For projects, SF gets them next-actioned and started the first time, but then for complex projects with parallel chains, I want additional support materials to keep my place and trigger subsequent Next Actions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 March 2011 at 3:15 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie - Great summary of the power of SF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 March 2011 at 15:11 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
