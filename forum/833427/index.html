It's almost fool-proof!  It's flexibility aides your resolve rather than being a vehicle to lure it away. Another huge benefit is that a weekly format accepts adjustments better.  It's hard to wreck it unless you're hell-bent on doing so!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 14:16 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Learning, can you explain more about your weekly DIT approach? Do you process next week what comes in this week? How do you handle urgent matters? TIA</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 15:07 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel<br>My brain isn't really up to par today but I'll try to highlight it.  You do it almost identically to daily DIT except you're you're pulling your daily MIT's from last week's incoming and project progress charts.  Of course, you still can add something tomorrow that came in today if it would be a better use of your time.  Afterall you have a week to finish the stuff!<br>And, when absolutely necessary, there's the below the line option.  Below the line is also great when you finish your work early and you want to free up another day.  <br>Because it's a weekly format, you need to have strict office hours.  Otherwise, Monday through Wednesday, your leisure time might get sacrificed in attempt to churn out a weeks worth of work.  The checklist covers the regular occuring chores and acts as a vehicle to conveniently batch your work. (email, inbox, calls, etc)  I use round-up days for my broad categories.(Accounts round-up, Projects review/plan round-up, Detail Housework round-up , etc) On the exact day, that category must be completed but I can chip away at it on previous days.<br><br>The beauty part is that it's VERY flexible and also it ensures that your work doesn't bleed into your leisure time unless you pre-scheduled over-time to free up a future day(s)...example: vacation , all day special event, or an all day work party.  The flexibility also accomdates emergencies, opportunities, wellness, sickness, etc.  The flexibility aspect works with your resolve and aims, not against it.<br><br>Also the flexibility allows you the ease of doing your normal habits and giving the ebb and flow of life to happen with a welcome attitude while maintaining control over nonsense distractions or wasting time on piddling stuff at the expense of what you deem to be worthwhile (even if it's not the exciting stuff)<br><br>You learn to measure your efforts against your aims within the work hours allotted.  That alone keeps reminding me the reason I'm doing the scut....to free myself up for the grander aspects of living...........inviting the passion of your life's work, cuddling a baby, learning something new, taking in a cultural event, sharing a cool one with friends, community work, etc...whatever you consider the grand aspects of living.<br>learning as I go<br>learning as I go<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 16:07 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel<br>I'd recommend reviewing Mark's book again.  There's things such as current initiative, time boxing, backlogs, etc......but it's more than the how to's he offers......It's his reasoning that really helps to know what prompted his suggestions and solutions.<br>Then you can set up your own lab and customize it to your personal needs with the assistance of his expertise. The attitude of the book invites you to think, experiment, etc within the principles....or outside of some them!  It's hard not to succeed if you're willing to tweak if necessary. ....and some tweaks are temporary....just to get over the hump!<br>I like a bit of variety to freshen things up.  The weekly format allows for lots of that!  LOL!<br><br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 July 2009 at 16:16 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel<br>Today my mind's a bit clearer.  Of course, you need to customize your own checklist.  Mine is mostly a printed copy of my normal habits and batching aid. Sometimes my checklist items will elevate to MIT status especially if I need the 30minute peace contract to be different than my Current Initiative.  It's a judgement call.<br>Also, if I'm flagging, I'll guiltlessly add below the red line, "What's better?" to right my attitude a bit.<br>The flexibility aspect allows room for these judgement calls.  Bottom line, I'm aiming to make best use of my time with the sub-goal of getting rid of the scut ASAP.  Like my working hours are used to reign in my focus and protect my leisure time, I place a limit of 90 minutes on my scut work or have it add up to no more than 9 hours a week.  True, it's necessary/important.  I'm simply being realistic about my reaction to boring work.  After it's done to my satisfaction for today or the 90minute cap, I'm free to do my more welcomed work without the nagging element.  (I might be over-reacting to the scut.....but it's my system realisticlally based on my strengths and my short-comings.  You checklist, projects handling and MIT's might be radically different.<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2009 at 16:04 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Learning,<br><br>You made me laugh when you wrote this:<br>"Because it's a weekly format, you need to have strict office hours.
