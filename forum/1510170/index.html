There is no such thing as erasing tasks.  Beyond that, if you use an electronic device it's technically possible to erase tasks, but doing so may destroy the balance in the system.  C2 should be of limited size such that if over time you are doing too many C2 tasks, the remaining C1 tasks are dismissed (highlighted and put away for later review).  C2 tasks are never dismissed, but all must be worked on.<br><br>"If I can erase it or make it with unlimited lines, thing gonna be easier."  I completely agree that it would be mechanically easier in most digital programs.  I can't vouch for whether you will have success either way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2011 at 14:22 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Pencil!

And won't destroy the balance.<br><br>If it technical possible, I wish when I go back to the old page (1st active page), all finished and highlighted tasks are achieved, so only unworked C1 tasks and unfinished or new entered C2 tasks are on that page (or every next page).<br>Just like when I move to the next page, I cross and re-enter all unworked C1 tasks to the end.<br><br>I gonna try it myself :-) Fun.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2011 at 17:02 | IL</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Why dismiss when C2 is full?   Here are some reasons.  It depends partly on WHY C2 got filled.<br><br>(1) C2 got filled because you have lots of ongoing unfinished work and/or urgent work.   This means you really don't have time for those C1 tasks right now.  Dismiss them.   You can re-enter them when (if) you have more bandwidth in the future.   Right now, you already have too much on your plate, so take care of that first.   Dismissal allows you to do that.<br><br>(2) C2 got filled because you cycled through your list many times but only a very small number of C1 items stood out on each pass.   This means you've had repeated exposure to those C1 tasks and they STILL did not feel ready to be done.  Dismiss them.   This will allow you to focus on what's really important to you right now.   You can re-enter them when (if) they call out to you in the future, during a review of dismissed items.   But for now, you need to get them out of the way.<br><br>(3) Combination of (1) and (2).    Dismiss them.    You've got enough to do already.<br><br><br>"Dismiss" does not mean "delete" or "kill" -- it means "put them in the drawer, for later consideration".<br><br>Dismissal frees you to focus on the things that are really important right now.   Don't be afraid of dismissal.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2011 at 21:54 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>Thank you so much. now I'm more clear now.<br><br>Reason 2 sounds like it accelerates tasks being dismissed.<br>It's for a better balance to let me (auto) focus on the really import tasks.<br><br>How often the (2) happens in your experience?<br>When it happened, about how many times had you visited those C1 tasks?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2011 at 7:51 | IL</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Now can someone explain their thinking pattern for successfully clearing the dismissed pages?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2011 at 13:33 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Most of the time, you viewed it more than twice (3-5 times?) before you dismiss it.<br><br>Some are not worth to do, some will not work on it in the near future (5 days or more).<br><br>Highlight it and forget it.<br><br>If you really wanna give it a chance, re-enter it, and highlight the rest.

Having a recurring task "Review dismissed" works fine.  <br><br>When there are too many dismissed pages and I can't cycle through all of them in one review, then I start entering "Review dismissed on page XXX" instead of just "Review dismissed".  Those smaller review items work well for filler time, such as waiting at the doctor office or multi-tasking during part of a meeting where my attention isn't required.<br><br>If the items for review are in a previous SF book, then I put a limit on how many times I should review it.  I'll enter "Review dismissed, old book, 1 of 3" or something like that.  After the first review, I'll enter "Review dismissed, old book, 2 of 3".  After 3 of 3, I am done with that old book and cross everything out, or toss the book, or file it.<br><br>Once, I just cut all the dismissed pages out of my book, stapled them together, and put them into my Paper In Box.  I then handled them as any other project -- "Clear the stapled stack of dismissed pages" -- which got entered into C2 repeatedly until it was cleared.   That worked pretty well - I liked how SF drove me to finish up with that stack.  It helped force me to be more decisive about whether I really wanted to keep those tasks hanging around or not.<br><br><br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt; I have my own answer, but it doesn't fit the SF rule set, so I ask. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>What is your answer?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2011 at 19:13 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My answer: Change the SF rules drastically, so that it's not really SF anymore.  With these rules, the question of dismissing comes up less often.  More often things are deleted from a page long before they get dismissed.  When an occasional page is dismissed, I immediately consider the handful of items, and either delete them or merge into a project plan and add "plan this project" back into SF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2011 at 20:22 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I still feel strange about the dismiss full page rule.
