(https://www.habitrpg.com/)<br><br>Site:<br><br>It focuses on gamification and productivity. It is a role playing game in which you get points for being productive and lose points for not being productive. It is broken into 4 sections:<br>Habits, Dailies, Todos, and Rewards. <br><br>The natural algorithm the site has will make you aware of the tasks that you're avoiding/procrastinating, the things you're doing to much (creative procrastination), easy tasks, hard tasks, and urgent tasks. The points for completing these different things scale proportionally. <br><br>There are even graphs for your vices and good habits.<br><br>Overall, the site is extremely powerful,very organized and with a very uncomplicated layout. On its own its amazing. But the extension, makes it even better!<br><br>Extension:<br><br>Its extension syncs with Workflowy, Asana, Tomato.es (pomodoro timer) and Google Tasks. This is a huge plus for it as you can drop your tasks (or manage) your tasks in any of these independent apps which suit your preference and HabitRPG will keep track of your productivity at each site. Also, there is a site blocker within this app which also gives or takes away points ( for visiting productive sites versus vice sites).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 May 2013 at 9:31 | GMBW</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Also, which I just have figured out... You can join 'Parties'  kind of like productivity socials. :) Basically, a group of accountability partners and/or friendly competitors to keep you from slacking off. :) If anyone, picks up on this and would like to join one/have an accountability partner let me know. Obviously, try out the site first to see if its something you like. :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 May 2013 at 16:11 | GMBW</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sounds a great site. I poked around on it a bit on your recommendation, and was impressed. There are quite a few sites popping up these days which take the addictive qualities of computer games and apply them to something constructive. One such which I been testing out is Duolingo for language learning, which is very good indeed, though still a bit rough around the edges in places: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://duolingo.com/">http://duolingo.com/</a><br><br>Unfortunately I can't try out HabitRPG myself because I'm working on developing another method at the moment, but I would be very interested in any reports from people who do try it out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 May 2013 at 16:21 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting site as well. Thanks Mark. I've been wanting to learn Spanish so this site will come in handy. I'll have to park that goal for a bit as I am juggling a few goals right now myself.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 May 2013 at 17:55 | GMBW</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark - great to hear you're working on a new method.  I've returned to DIT (early days yet) to see how I get on with it.<br>Best wishes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 May 2013 at 10:50 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Better explanation of the game (short and long version) can be found here:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://community.habitrpg.com/section/tutorials">http://community.habitrpg.com/section/tutorials</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2013 at 16:29 | GMBW</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Its been about 3 weeks now of consistent usage of HabitRPG. I must say, that this site really is effective. So, an update:<br><br>At first, I was still figuring out how this game is played as many of the (quickly growing) community starts out as well...confused...until you understand how to play and how to lose.<br><br>Now that I am clearer on how the game is played, let me reiterate/resummarize.<br>_____________________________________________________________<br>As I explained earlier, the developers allow you to enter a habit, a daily, a todo or a reward. <br>-Habits, are things you want to track more than once a day (stop smoking, drink water, pushups etc.) <br>-Dailies are things you commit to do once a day (prepare healthy breakfast, wake up before 7am, wash dishes, 1 hour of productive work etc.). <br>-Todos are plain old (one off/non recurring) todos aka things you do once. <br>-Rewards, are things you want to reward your self with for doing work (Read Mark Forster Blog, Cookie, watch youtube etc.)<br>_____________________________________________________________<br>Units that control the game:<br>Health- You are given health points (hp). 50 hp is a full healthy life but at 0hp you die and are set back a level.<br>Experience-You are given experience points (xp). Each level requires more xp to level up. <br>Money- You are given Gold and Silver. Each Reward costs some monetary amount. You use this to buy rewards and armor (armor is a whole other story, but for the sake of simplicity, ignore it for now, and just assume it decorates your character and helps you along your journey).<br><br>_____________________________________________________________<br>How do you gain/lose Health points, Experience Points and Money?<br><br>-When you complete Habits, Dailies or Todos you are given ‘Experience’ and ‘Money’. The amount ranges but depends proportionally on a powerful algorithm based on how much you procrastinate on it, urgency of it, and difficuly of it.   <br><br>-When you level up, as in gain enough Experience for your level, you re-up on your Health Points.<br><br>-When you fail to complete your Dailies by midnight, you are punished in Health.<br><br>-When you delete your Daily, (delete a commitment you previously made to yourself), you are punished in Health points.<br><br>-When you do bad habits, you lose Experience.<br><br>-When you purchase a reward that you can’t afford, you are punshised in Health points.<br><br>-When you complete 21 Dailies in a row (Dont break the chain) you get a bonus in experience and money<br><br>_____________________________________________________________<br>Parties?<br>Parties are other community members you can invite to join to be accountability partners, chat buddies, real life friends, competitors, productivity enthusiasts etc.  <br><br>_____________________________________________________________<br>How am I using HabitRPG?<br>As I’ve been a Forster system person for a few years, I’ve been rotating through lists Habits, Dailies,Todo,Rewards similar to AF4R (i think?) in which you rotate in the manner of unfinished, urgent,old and new (you guys know what I mean :p) or D,W,M for DWM, or Column 1, Column 2 in SF.<br><br>_____________________________________________________________<br>Results so far?<br>Overall, excellent. It is so much fun to do dreaded tasks! Your entire life is treated like a game. The better you do the more you win and the worse you do the more you lose. But the motivation, competition, rewards, and the midnight deadline is what really is the driving force to actually be productive consistently.  The best way I can describe it is addictive fun productivity which happens to be governed by a ui that represents your life.<br><br>Ok, some actual results I’m impressed with (By the way, HabitRPG measures/tracks everything graphically):<br><br>Healthy meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) prepared consistently 17 days in a row.<br>Workout on schedule and on time consistently 14 days in a row.<br>Phone Calls Backlog wittling away<br>Vice Websites minimized<br>Junk food minimized (Well, I have Chocolate as a reward and cookies as a reward, but have been making them more expensive to decrease the chances of choosing it)<br>Obsessing/Overplanning minimized<br>Decision time less than 5 minutes maximized<br>3 MIT completion 16 days in a row <br>todos completed -65 (not bad as my 3MIT’s are getting completed consistently!)<br>Wake up by 6am- slowly getting better at this<br>….<br><br>Those are specific results but a very good measure is HabitRPGs graph of Experience over time. The higher steeper the slope, the better you’re doing. But there are more detailed stats (which I don’t expect many to understand, if you havent played it) here:<br><br>Training Sword: 0% Exp gain<br>Cloth Armor: 0% Defense<br>Leather Helm: 2% Defense<br>No Shield: 0% Defense<br>Stats<br>HP: 45 / 50<br>GP: 68<br>Lvl: 9<br>Exp: 209 / 250<br>Strength: 4<br>Defense: 4<br>Pets Found: 6<br><br>Total Strength: 4 %<br>Total Defense: 6 %<br><br>Thanks for reading (all the way here) :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2013 at 1:40 | GMBW</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Again, it would be interesting to have some forum members (productivity ppl) in a party.
