I had assumed, reasonably enough I think, that my not wanting to be told when to do something (even by myself) would not impact on things I enjoyed doing.  Someone else posted that they never had any problems with things they enjoyed doing and I thought I related to that, that my reasons for not doing things I enjoyed were purely down to my time management and the "guilt factor".  However, I am finding a resistance to things I enjoy doing that have a deadline, so think that there is more of a deadline issue than I initially realised.<br><br>To be specific I have a talk to prepare for tomorow - that is something I will enjoy doing so the task itself is not the issue.  I am not on the right page so that is a factor, but I could use the common sense rule (and obviously will do so if it gets to that stage).  I have started the task so it is moving. I can see how the system will eventually get me to stage you are now at, of working primarily towards the end of your lists but I am not there yet.  I know that I may have to action tasks "outside the system" (common sense/scheduled) but would prefer that to be the exception rather than the rule for all but static appointments.<br><br>I am just going to "trust the system" and strongly believe this issue will resolve itself once I get more proficient but have you found any solution to this problem yourself other than the common sense rule? <br><br>Actually I'm not really sure why I'm bothering to post this question Mark, other than that it has already helped me to get the issue clear in my head?  I have a strong premonition that your answer will be "just trust the system and use the common sense rule where necessary!" <br><br>Thanks :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2009 at 13:04 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine, what was the outcome?  Can't wait to hear.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2009 at 23:13 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Actually the outcome was very interesting.  I had pretty much free reign on the topic but had a fairly good idea as to what I was going to talk on.  However preparing the talk didn't stand out and "just doing it" didn't feel the right approach.  I had already done the basics on a Powerpoint presentation so had no problem finishing that off - the Powerpoint was incidental to the talk and did not specifically relate to the content.  The amazing thing was that, when finalising the Powerpoint, my thoughts went off in a completely different direction and I prepared a totally different talk to what I had originally intended  ............ So, yet again "trusting the system" came through for me .... :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 0:04 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The same thing happened for me on Wednesday.  For two weeks I had needed to prepare a demo of our new system for some engineers, but I just kept resisting it.  Finally on Weds morning the time was right, and I just cranked it out, and it all came together really well.  <br><br>Part of me still questions and doubts... isn't this the same old college behavior, cramming before the test, waiting till the deadline before a superhuman effort is required to get the thing done, so I can get the adrenalin rush of an amazing achievement?  <br><br>But then part of me answers back -- maybe there's some value to this kind of procrastination -- letting things stew till their properly cooked.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 2:04 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I know what you mean about worrying that it's a repeat of "usual" last minute behaviour but I've found that it feels completely different.  The stress isn't there, the panic isn't there and I am not frantically trying to cram everything in at the last minute.  it may be done at the last minute but it has been on the basis of working productively on an hour's work in an hour rather than feeling I've tried to cram 6 hours work into that hour and not done a particularly good job at it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 10:21 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine and Seraphim:<br><br>I had a very good example of this a week or so ago. I had to circulate the members of a new committee to find the best day to have the next meeting. It was more complicated than it sounds because some members were still being recruited, and not all were on email.<br><br>Anyway I started panicking because some of the related action didn't stand out for me on AF. So what I then did was change the system so that the action would get done. Result: a huge increase in resistance to the whole project. <br><br>Two days later I went back to "pure" AF and the tasks got done without fuss, but probably later than I would have done them if I'd stuck to AF.<br><br>I learnt my lesson!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 11:27 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So Mark, I guess my premonition was right!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 12:38 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just trust the system and use the common sense rule when necessary.

I worked on them because I HAD to, not because I got that "standing out" feeling.<br><br>Hm, wonder if I'd get a written notice from my manager or something?  Is it worth the risk?  I'd certainly need to justify my lack of action, and I'm not so sure "Autofocus told me to do something else" and "It just didn't stand out" would go over so well...  :-)<br><br>I'll let you know how it turns out...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 15:32 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To follow up on my last post a minute ago, the reason it's hard to explain some of this to my manager, is precisely because AF operates at the intuitive level.  One doesn't always immediately understand WHY AF is prompting you to do (or not do) something.  It's not so easy to articulate those intuitive reasons.  Though I think the whole AF process is making it easier...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 15:35 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim<br><br>So far none of my decisions to go with AF have caused me to miss a deadline and although I have had to do some of the work partially outside the system (in that it has been when I have felt the time to be right but have not necessarily been on the right page) the completion of those tasks has been drastically different, with less stress, no sense of panic, and sometimes with a complete change of method.<br><br>You seem to me to be articulating the intuitive side pretty well from your various posts.  Have you thought about recommending AF to your manager?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 15:54 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine:<br><br>That's certainly been my experience as well - that AF makes me more likely to meet a deadline rather than less... and with considerably less stress too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 18:34 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have the same experience -- AF certainly does help me meet deadlines.<br><br>I'm just thinking about pushing the edges of the system, to see how far I can really trust it under difficult circumstances.  These are "what if" scenarios at this point...  <br><br>Maybe those mission-critical tasks with a hard deadline will just always "stand out", and thereby never get missed.<br><br>But what happens if I *do* dismiss it?  That's what I'm interested in.  Will it become clear that the "mission critical" task really wasn't so mission critical?  Will I be able to communicate that to my manager?  Or will the task just pop back up again on the end of my list because (1) I caught it when reviewing dismissed tasks or (2) it came into my mind that I hadn't done it yet!   Or (worst case) will the task just get missed, and cause trouble for me, my manager, and our project?<br><br>These are the areas where I am finding I am still reluctant to "trust the system" and still get tempted to "make exceptions".  I do lean toward trusting the system, since I've found it to work so well.  But I still have reservations about some of these scenarios.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 19:34 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think we have to make our decisions based on how strongly we feel about the task at hand and how strong our gut instinct is.  To a degree that will depend upon the importance of the task and the penalty for not meeting the deadline - if we were due to appear in court then the "I didn't feel it was the right time" reason might not be appreciated and we can be pretty sure about the penalty. <br><br>From experience so far, when a task gets to dismissal stage it is clear why it is being dismissed or alternatively what the reason for the resistance is so that the course of action can be chosen in an informed way.<br><br>If you are reviewing your lists regularly a crtitical task is unlikely to get missed - if you decide not to action it it will be more likely to be a conscious and informed decision than otherwise.  Your subconscious is after all aware of the deadlines involved.<br><br>However at the end of the day you can only see what happens when it happens - hypothetical doesn't work well with AF because your subconscious knows it is only hypothetical.<br><br>There's a saying that we need to decide which bridges to cross and which to burn - we cannot do either until we reach them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 20:02 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't think you could ever dismiss a mission critical item (other than rephrasing it to make it more "doable" or transferring it to your calendar) because then if you could dismiss it, it wouldn't be mission critical. It may be the last thing on your list and it may not stand out in the way that items stand out when a page is new but some things are always going to be horrible to start. Why AF is so powerful is that it creates another option which is worse - dismissing the task which effectively adds another task to the page in addition to the one you are resisting and you can do either but you have to do one. If the task is important that in comparison that horrible task doesn't seem so horrible (much less horrible than dismissing it when it's mission critical). <br><br>If you started finding yourself dismissing items that were truly mission critical then that would be a signal that you were not committed to the project and if the project was a fundamental part of your job, that you were not committed to your job. Could be your subconscious saying that you need a job change?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 21:38 | Catherine CS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim (and others):<br><br>I know we talk about "trusting the system", which makes it sound as if it's some sort of external power, but I think it's important to remember that it's actually us who are in charge. AF simply gives us a framework to think more effectively. It's not an excuse for behaving irresponsibly in any way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2009 at 8:34 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
