I think Autofocus is still the best system I have ever used, and that includes DWM.  After several test trials with DWM -- on paper and digitally -- I have found that Autofocus works the best for me.  And you know what -- I am having a wonderful time with the original version of Autofocus!  And I am very happy to be back to my spiral-bound paper notebook.<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2010 at 14:34 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Welcome to the club!<br><br>Although I'm sitting over there, in the dark corner of the tweakers...

Glad to be joining the AF1 group in the corner.  Yes, after so much testing and searching, the original Autofocus seems to be the best for me.<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2010 at 18:30 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A bit of advice if I might...Spend little to no time reading about others' latest and greatest AF/DWM versions then. It's an unnecessary distraction. I have found this advice to be helpful where homeschooling curriculum is concerned. I am very happy with what I have, but I can get sucked into looking at something else and before I know it, I've lost money and time and for what? To fix something that wasn't broken! Wishing you both well with AF1 which is the method my friend still uses successfully.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2010 at 18:52 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I Like using AF1 too even if i am acustomed to AF4. For me the main difference beetwin the 2 is that there is for me a better control of each page with AF1 but a danger about not doing the urgent things first this is why i start my day from the end of the list. AF4 use mote the concept of close list but finaly AF1 or AF4 both are efficient with me... So what else ?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2010 at 19:36 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As I've posted here before, I'm also still using and happy with AF1. I think the more complexity added to rules for managing your lists just brings your higher-level thinking down into the mundane. AF1 is simple, trustworthy, and efficient and there's not much to think about.<br><br>Regarding the supposed drawback around urgent tasks: I don't seem to have that issue. First of all, if you're doing a good job managing your work, you'll have few urgent tasks related to work that you can control. <br><br>The other type of urgent task that might come up is from an external source (like a firedrill from your manager). Since this essentially gets thrown in your face, it's not like you need a special technique for managing the urgent task. It basically temporarily kills your time management (and that's why managers who have many firedrills have unproductive workers).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2010 at 23:36 | Jonathan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As I posted elsewhere - I have ended up back with AF1 also - and extremely happy with it.<br>I never had any problems doing urgent tasks - they interrupt page-by-page flow and only if really really necessary - and I get through all my pages several times per day anyway.<br><br>The ability to focus on just one page is very comforting to me. And I just let my right brain decide whats ready to be addressed. It helps me do a little and often all the time.<br><br>I have tweaked my own rules for dismissing pages (I currently have no pages older than 7 days) but dismissal was never an issue for me anyway. I happily dismiss untackled items, confident that they will pop back again sometime in the future if they are essential to my life or business.<br><br>Viva AF1!<br><br>Respect<br>Paul</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2010 at 12:30 | Zytex</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've pretty much stuck with AF1 all the way through - I tried each new version but found that AF1 suits me the best - simple, uncomplicated and it made me the most productive I think I've ever been.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2010 at 2:15 | Warren Peace</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi David,<br>Could you elaborate a bit on why you are favoring the original AF over AF4 - i.e., what exactly are the key differences? <br>Thanks!<br>Claudia</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2010 at 11:25 | Claudia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Long live AF2.

I sometimes leave my ToDo list for days at a time and it was a bit of a fuss in renumbering days. (I was using an electronic approach so I was shifting tasks around electronic folders).<br><br>There's just something about the simplicity and power of AF1.<br><br>AF4 is pretty good too with the only downside being that the closed list really feels too long compared to the AF1 lists.<br><br>I have been thinking recently about having an AF4 open list tagged onto the end of a series of AF1 closed lists, instead of just one long closed list as in AF4...and then turning each AF4 "dismissed" closed list into a new AF1 list instead to extract the maximum from it.<br><br>I'm still thinking over the mechanics of it :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2010 at 13:48 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Claudia,<br><br>As you know, I think that AF4 is a great system.  But I went back and reread the instructions for AF1 and realized that I really missed the simple one page blocks of AF1.  Plus, believe it or not, I find I can get to the end of the list more quickly in AF1!  With AF4, one must keep cycling through the closed list before one can move into the open list.  I would find myself doing a lot of work on the closed list, which is good, but I would tend to stay there as things kept getting added to the end of the open list.  With AF1, it seems easier to navigate through each closed page and before you know it, you are at the last page.<br><br>Hope that is clear and makes some sense....<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2010 at 18:31 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been thinking about mixing AF1 + AF4. Specifically, AF1 using AF4's dismissal.<br><br>Instead of marking the tasks and leave them marked until whenever I want, <br>I would highlight them, and the next time I travel the page, I have to decide for each of them to do it, rephrase it or discard it.<br><br>That could make the system more dynamic. Anyway, I'm trying DWM by now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2010 at 18:46 | Walter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I suppose that one could come up with a DWM/AF variant where you mark the date tasks are added, use one of the AF modes of working, then if you get to the point where there are tasks on the list added &gt;30 days ago, you delete them via the DWM dismissal rule.  You could get past the renumbering problem by just mentally taking into account how many days were lost and accounting for it by adding to 30.  The advantage would be that the simplicity of simply adding to the end of the list (as in the AF systems) would be there and the complexity of adding to different places on different days would be removed.  The decision to delete tasks via calculating the date would be as simple as in DWM and renumbering would be a non-issue.<br><br>I think there would be some mental gymnastics that some would like and others not so much ;-)  Or you can grossly simplify by just deleting tasks over 30 days old no mater what!  I mean, so what if you are out sick two days.  Does that impact things that have been on the list for 30 days?  And if it is a three week vacation, maybe the entire list should be "reset".  Maybe just draw a line and put: "Stopped for three weeks here and leave anything before that on the list until you reach tasks past that point ... then go ahead and delete them.<br><br>I think much of the problem with the DMW system stems from assigning magical properties to the numbers 7 and 30!  ;-)<br><br>Just a random thought or two.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2010 at 19:15 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; I think much of the problem with the DMW system stems from assigning magical properties to the numbers 7 and 30! &gt;&gt;<br><br>Slight correction, DWM magical numbers are 7 and 28/29/30/31 depending on the month. Now if you chose lunar month (like Norman U do) the magical numbers would be 7 and 27/28/29/30 depending on which moon you're following.
