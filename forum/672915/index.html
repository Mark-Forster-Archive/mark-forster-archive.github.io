Add a task to "check schedule" on every page.  That should fix the dates in your mind each time you check it.<br><br>2) Try adding a task "review bill payment system" and when that stands out look at how you deal with bills.  Look at things such as using Direct Debits, internet payment etc.<br><br>3) Be aware that AF identifies reasons for resistance.

I don't understand how that works.  If I finish the item and cross it off, now it's not on every page (and on fewer pages each time I do it).  If I don't cross it off, then the the first 5 or so lines of every page will be periodic things like pay bills, check email, make calls, etc.  How does this work with AutoFocus?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 February 2009 at 17:18 | wired.abyss</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>wired.abyss<br><br>It works for recurring items such as "check email" or "check schedule" that you need or wish to do on a regular basis.  I have "check email" on every page, and sometimes more than once if I have actioned it and feel a need to readd it, perhaps owing to a larger than normal build up.  You are correct that it will be on fewer pages each time you cross it off but those pages will have fewer items. As you are moving through the pages, you will see that item on one page or another, and action it or not, according to whether it stands out.  I will always have to check email on a regular basis so will put it on every page.  That ensures it will not get forgotten (as if!) but also enables me not to check email every two minutes or so!<br><br>Hope that helps .......</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 February 2009 at 17:55 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For tasks with a hard deadline (like paying a bill might be) I write the due date left of the check-off box and highlight it. Every morning I scan all active pages for tasks due today (and quite often they are already done).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 12:21 | Christian G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For the last number of years, I have prepaid my monthly bills.  I set up an automatic payment for the year so that I stay roughly one month ahead (with one off seasonal adjustments for heat etc.).  There's a wonderful psychological feeling I get when I open up the bill and it says CR bal - DO NOT PAY in big bold letters.  If I did have a balance on it, I would write it on the AF list with a due date (about 5 days before it's *really* due) - sometime in the next 2 weeks or so you'll surely see it.  I also get those bills that I can paid off directly to my Visa (I get points!) so there's less bills that I have to worry about.  The big Visa and Mastercard always get paid off in full well online prior to the due date, and I write the date that it's due on my AF list.  I also have an automatic payment going through for my Visa after the bill goes out, but before it's due of approximately the average amount I spend on a low-purchasing month.  That way I could never miss a minimum payment.  And when the payment is due, often I either don't owe anything on that previous bill or it's a fairly small amount.<br><br>From a strict financial viewpoint, the above doesn't make any sense because someone else is using your money for a period of time.  But it's like keeping a large balance in my checking account that doesn't earn much interest, the psychological effect of knowing I could be on holiday or really busy at work and not have to worry about this stuff is worth the $10/year in foregone interest I could be earning on that money.<br><br>Six months ago, I accidentally double paid my Visa by a very large amount - a hardwood flooring purchase.  I had an automatic postponed payment going through my postdated list through my bank which I had forgotten about and written in my calendar to pay the visa on a date 5 days before it was due.   I was so paranoid about paying it off that I paid it twice.  Which is especially embarrassing since I'm an accountant by training.  :-(<br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 13:21 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Regarding this comment,  "Be aware that AF identifies reasons for resistance.

I had one bill that I had high resistance to (posted about previously) and could not understand why I just resisted paying that bill in particular until I realised that there were a lot of other things tied up with that particular invoice.  Nothing to do with the amount of the bill, the ease of paying it, money in the bank etc. ......... :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 17:46 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I experience similar issues with email and sorting desk papers. I am sure putting these on every page would solve it, but that is effectively a two list system, and I would like to make purist AF work if possible.<br><br>Perhaps with emails it does not matter if I am slightly behind, but before AF I had zero inbox and a clear desk for months, which was a psychological boost.<br><br>The other side of the coin is that I have done other things with the time I used to spend on zealous email clearing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 18:22 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't use AF for these kinds of tasks.  I subscribe to Backpack (www.backpackit.com) and use its Reminders to 'remember' things like bills.  I schedule a monthly recurring reminder and each month on the day and time I choose, I get a text message on my phone and an email.<br><br>I did/do use AF to first set up those reminders - "set up reminder for electric bill'.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 18:46 | Zane</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Personally I pay all my recurring bills by Direct Debit. That both saves a lot of time and means I never get hassled over unpaid bills.<br><br>Non recurring bills I pay immediately as part of the "Clear Paper" task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 16:44 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline,<br><br>Have you been spying on me?  ;-)  That sounds almost EXACTLY like my system.  My Visa is auto debited from my checking so the only thing I NEED to do is be sure that the checking balance is always high enough (by the due date anyway) to cover the automatic debit.  I always keep it WELL above what I need.  My bank will send me emails when eBills come in and pay then (because I've chosen that option) just before they are due ... I have time to review them once I see the email which is my reminder.  No need for AF at all.<br><br>I may change to the option by electric company offers for a level payment program.  That way I could forget about them all together.  Now I do what you do ... pay what I think is a reasonable amount automatically then make a second payment to cover s shortage.  I got busy and thought I had the electric company covered, but I got behind because if a REALLY cold winter this year.  What I thought was a safe minimum was only about 25% of what the monthly bill came it at.  WOW!  It cost me a few bucks in late fees, but no really big problem.  For the moment, I'll update the permanent amount and drop it again when spring comes.<br><br>But the really big lesson there is to set a side a day of the month (at least) to review all bills.  My practice is to drop all bills into a bright yellow folder and keep that in my inbox.  I can review it on Saturday mornings and manage the bills from there.  Again, this is not an AF thing. I make it a rule to not put this kind of thing into AF.  I pay bills BECAUSE it is Saturday, not because I saw an entry in AF.  If I needed a reminder to do it on Saturday, I'd put that in my calendar, because it is date related.<br><br>Neat to see someone with such a similar system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 20:57 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re. auto debit to your bank account - the reason why I don't do this where I can have it auto-charged to my Visa is that it's virtually impossible to get back your money if your bank account is directly charged, but this is not the case with Visa/MC.  <br>And again, don't forget the points!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 21:42 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline,<br><br>Yes, I was unclear.  I have already found out the dangers of allowing companies to autodebit.  I do allow them to ebill and let the bank pay the ebll, sometimes.  Mostly I use Visa, but that once was a problem when the cable company hiked its rates without notice and I missed seeing the change ... I had to fight them thorugh the county government to get that one backed out.<br><br>I use Visa for about everything now except the mortgage payment, which won't allow payment by credit card.  Also, the electric company and water won't take cards.<br><br>Points are great.  I've not figured out how best to use them yet.  It seems as though they don't translate well.  IOW, it takes a whole lot of points to buy very little.  It seems as if they really devalue them.  But hey, better than nothing ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2009 at 10:04 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use my points to buy gift cards for people at Christmas time so Christmas is almost paid for that way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2009 at 13:37 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gift Cards  ... hmmmmm, what a great idea!
