I am always fascinated by this system which mixes all my stuff and make me really efficient. AF1 forces me to reformulate my thoughts and has a real control on my stuff. <br>Compare to SF there is a lack with urgencies. So I try do do them first, dropping what is less important in the double reading process. I still prefer AF1 because The big mess of all tasks i.e. unfinished, urgents, non actionable, actionable, future and dismissed and so on, has a real peaceful effect on my mind like a feeling of new on everything what does not appear to me with SF. This effect makes me really enthusiastic about everything and desapear with SF which is for me a kind of control. Then I may conclude that AF facilitate intuition and SF the rational part of my brain. But it is only my own feeling.<br><br>But there are still some question which haunt me. <br>I am trying to make an organization for 2012 which will accept the huge work I have every days. So I red again AF1 rules but there are some question I am sure were told in this forum but I forgot. Could you help me about it ?<br><br>1. About project. I mean project in the sense of GTD do you separate Tasks in AF and project or do you include them in the list ? <br><br>2. About Urgencies. AF1 is created to do things little by little. But as you said Mark urgencies must be done first. How do you do ? Do you dash them in the list ? <br><br>3. About the tasks themselves. I put everything which comes to my mind and everything I am waiting for and if something is not finished or is in a waiting for I reformulate and put it at the end of the list. <br><br>Reading it again, I notice that the un actionable tasks are dismissed and after erased and some would better go in a someday may be list and some will begin in the future. I also noticed that I work on maximum 2 full A4 pages.<br><br>Then my question is simple what do you put in your list ? Or exactly what is left in your list only actionable tasks ? Do you use a someday may be list for things you don't know you will do or not, Do you use a tickler list or a file or your agenda for the future tasks or projects in the sense of GTD ?<br><br>Thanks for all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 December 2011 at 10:51 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter:<br><br>I share your feelings about AF1. It's far the most pleasant method to work with - even pleasurable. However it does unfortunately have drawbacks. Most of my subsequent AFs/SFs etc have been attempts to overcome the drawbacks without sacrificing the feel of AF1.<br><br>In answer to your questions:<br><br>1. You can enter projects however you like. As a complete project, as individual tasks within the project, or both at the same time. I usually do both at the same time, but I don't attempt to be consistent about this.<br><br>2. I don't have a satisfactory answer to urgencies, which is why I've spent so much time designing other systems. The official answer is that you treat them exactly the same as any other task, but if something becomes so urgent that you need to do it now, you do it now regardless of where it is on the list..<br><br>3. I put everything I think of in my list, and allow the system itself to filter it. Dismissed tasks are marked up and reviewed regularly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 December 2011 at 11:27 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF1 and organization Part 2.<br><br>Thanks for theses quick answers mark it is clear for me. <br><br>I have some others questions.<br><br>The first one is about dismissing. You said a "dismiss task is a task which is no longer active but subject to review" if I well remembered. <br><br>I have a curious example. <br><br>4. I plan to make a new account spread sheet for 2012. <br>It is a project with takes a lot of time. I have to imagine the template, I have to report the numbers and finally, include the future previsional incomes. I guess it will take about 3 hours at least. <br><br>Reading it I thought well I must do it, but not now I need to call my clients first. It is not dismissed cause it is not "no longer active but subject to review. It is a real important task but I will do it in my cool time may be at 9 PM tonight or later. How do you do for this kind of tasks with AF1 ? Is that kind of task a dismissed one ? I have quiet the same with the 2012 wishes it will take a long time too may be 6 hours. How can I treat this one ?<br><br>5. I need some specific lists.  I like reading all my business opportunities on one page. I put here all the potential business. It makes me focus on the most important potential incoming cash-flow. Does it go agains AF rules ? Or can I keep the system ? Other example are my lists of buildings or list of clients. <br><br>6. I like having all my info on one place so I use an A4 spiral paper note book which never leave me everywhere. I use the left page for AF1 and the right page for incoming notes and thought which will help me later to decide about doing things or not. I also use some specific pages for notes about complicated projects when I am outside the office. All that notes are later on if needed summarized in a specific .txt file on my computer . Does it go against AF rules or is it ok with the system ?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 December 2011 at 13:02 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter:<br><br>4. I'm not clear what the problem is here. On the face of it the answer is obvious: schedule the task to be done at 9pm. But why are you talking about dismissal in this context? I don't understand. I suggest you re-read the rules of AF1: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/</a> or the French version at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/french/">http://www.markforster.net/french/</a> with particular reference to the sections on dismissal.<br><br>5. and 6. Specific lists and information pages are fine. And even if they weren't, we're not talking about the 10 Commandments here - you are completely at liberty to adapt the system to your own requirements.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 December 2011 at 13:41 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>How about a quick day plan for urgent and time specific stuff?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 December 2011 at 13:47 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>OK I red again the instruction. In English :-)<br>Nothing to say. The system is almost perfect. <br>As you said "It's far the most pleasant method to work with - even pleasurable." For myself I think addict able and pleasurable ;-)<br><br>It is a very comfortable system. I have worked with it since 2 days, after having letting it down for years and I did not miss anything. More I spent these 2 days doing the most affordable things I had to do. However I try to take some altitude to be less in the action. Because the system is so fast and so easy that it makes you acting and acting and sometimes it is nice to rest and think about things. <br><br>The truth is in the middle. <br><br>I solved the problem about point 4.<br><br>I laugh about de ten commandements. ;-) Thanks Mark.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 December 2011 at 16:50 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks again for the brush up about dismissing stuff. I saw again the video and understood lot of details I did not catch years ago. The video is very well done, clear and helpful to understand.<br><br>After testing all yours systems and GTD and Brian Tracy system I think that AF1 is the most suitable for my activity. First because it collects everything, second because it make me doing the write choices at the right time even if I am completely overwhelmed, third because it is perfect to control my stuff even If there is many interruption. By the nature of my job it is very difficult to stay a long time on a subject. The little and often approach is the perfect system to control what can not be usually controlled e.g business opportunities. <br><br>About urgencies Thanks to smilepete the idea of a quick plan for urgencies is a good idea. But there are not a lot of real urgencies. There are situation were I must be reactive, but is it a real urgency ? Even I I do it 2 or 3 hours laters there is more often no consequences. <br><br>I don't know what will be your new system you are working on but I hope it will be in the way of AF1. On my opinion, there is nothing better than this system and it is almost better than no system at all and what is most important I take a lot a pleasure working with it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 December 2011 at 7:26 | FocusGuy.</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
