I think if I were one of your clients, I'd appreciate your being honest enough to admit you're overwhelmed at the moment, and I'd be happier to receive an honest estimate of when you could complete the work, rather than being left in the dark and wondering whether I'd ever get my accounts back.  <br><br>To get to a good honest estimate, you could make your best guess at how long each job would take.  You could then decide whether to do a little work on each client's accounts and keep rotating through them, or whether to work on one client's accounts to completion, then the next, etc.  <br><br>I think that doing the above may help to get over the overwhelm you're feeling, and give you some space to think of a better way of working, in which you allow time for the routine admin, but focus more strongly on the actual accounting work.  It shoud hopefully give you practice in estimating how long each job will take, so that you can be more realistic about how much work you take on.  <br><br>Best wishes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2010 at 11:06 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Simon, <br><br>Thank you for your detailed post, it makes it much easier to get people to address the situation when they understand your context with some clarity.  <br><br>I could have written your post about a dozen years ago when I was self-employed as an accountant.  My experience was that I hated working alone so much that I procrastinated on my work all the time.  I ended up getting an office and hiring someone on contract to work with me.   I procrastinated on the work, yet I loved - and still love - accounting mostly because I liked being part of a team effort at work.  The procrastination behaviours didn't really resolve until I went to work in a team environment in a corporate setting.<br><br>I would suggest as well as examining the kajillion threads on procrastination on here and the posts above  that you go a little deeper and look at whether you're really enjoying either what you're doing or the way that you're doing it (ie. working at home, isolated from others, multiple "bosses"...)  Mechanics can make you want to do something, but often only temporarily.  You have to keep on using the techniques, but then again, sometimes if you do it enough, you change your view of yourself too as a "procrastinator" or not.<br><br>I also thrived on "deadline adrenaline" (still do).  I'm not sure if that's the case for you?  I ended up finding work that was really narrow window deadline oriented where it ended up being a positive, not a negative to be that way.  There's ways to manufacture that if that's part of your problem.  <br><br>It sounds to me that you're still looking at the whole picture when you're talking about contacting your clients, etc.  It would probably help if you started to not do that.  Can you move all the filing and all the files and whatever to another room or just to get over this mess, go to another location like a library, friend's house or coffee shop with nothing but one client's work and your computer?<br><br>Here's a passage from Anne Lamott's book on writing - "Bird by Bird":<br><br>"I also remember a story that I know I’ve told elsewhere but that over and over helps me to get a grip: thirty years ago my older brother, who was ten years old at the time, was trying to get a report on bird written that he’d had three months to write, which was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother’s shoulder, and said, “Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.”<br><br>Good luck!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2010 at 13:22 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thank you for your comments, apart from Norman, who obviously thinks he's either witty or clever - he's neither.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2010 at 15:54 | Simon H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Simon - Norman is the self-appointed Yoda of this board.

This can be a rather more positive mindset. <br><br>Most of us would say that the VERY first thing is to stop the backlog building up any further. This may mean looking at systems and at the number of clients, and looking at asking someone else to help (or even finding another accountant for some of them).<br><br>Until you have done that, I wouldn't make any promises to anyone. when you have addressed the underlying problems, you can credibly go back to your (remaining) clients and explain the position and how you would like to go forward.<br><br>Don't worry about the filing. Just get the first file out. And start. But the important this is to get the first file out.<br><br>Do It Tomorrow has a load of great stuff on procrastination.

However, there are indeed some gems as Avrum points out, and Norman does make some good points if you can stand his somewhat direct approach.<br><br>I would hesitate to broadcast your problem to all your clients, I'd try and start dealing with the one that might have the biggest impact if left untouched for much longer.  By all means seek out all the tips and advice on this forum, and then try the one that appeals and works for you as who you are.  Be true to yourself, you do strike me as someone with a sense of integrity.<br><br>One of the nice things about this forum is that it makes one feel NOT alone, others have similar problems, and procrastination crops up time and again.  When I'm not working abroad "in strange places with questionable people", I work in my home office.<br><br>Just like Jacqueline states, it's not easy, we have to impose some structure on the situation. Rather than just a "formula", I believe Mark Forster's approach is pragmatic and there is much to learn from this forum.<br><br>Beware of too much introspection (says me who falls prey to it sometimes) and analysis, but some reflection can help.  I think one of my problems is a low threshold for boredom, I like getting excited and immersed in new things - and suffer by not finishing off obligations etc.<br><br>None of us is perfect, including those that scorn our inefficiency.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2010 at 21:25 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Simon - I could have written your post myself as well!  There are some great points here, and I agree you may have to do some soul searching at some point and also some re-organisation of your priorities. However now should be the time for action before anyone has a serious problem with you not doing some work - the outcome for your clients could be severe if you are late filing paperwork for them, and the quite frankly you wouldn't have a business at all.<br><br>Looking at it from the outside here is what I would do:<br><br>1. Make a list of all outstanding projects.<br>2. Identify the projects that will be the most problem if they are not completed soon. - These will become your priority.<br>3. Do not contact your customers with any half baked excuses or they will run.  Make sure if you have to report a delay or problems it is something they can relate to - IT problems, illness or something - just owning up to incompetence is not going to inspire confidence in your abilities no matter how good an accountant you are!<br>4. Make a plan - with dates - preferrably with daily lists - this may include drafting in some help if you can either afford it, or if you have the resources generally.<br>5. Once you have a plan then you can confidently talk to your clients.  <br>6. I certainly recommend Mark's books - they are packed full of tips you can implement as you go along. One of his great ideas is to ring fence a problem area (for example the filing) and then to make it a 'current intiative' which mean you spend a small amount of time on it first thing every day and clear it as quickly as possibly.<br><br>Good luck Simon - and let us know how you get on!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2010 at 23:24 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>RogerJ<br><br>"Beware of too much introspection (says me who falls prey to it sometimes) and analysis"<br><br>Important. If you have to be consumed with yourself, best to do it with someone else, so they can keep the extremity of your vanities in some reasonable context.<br><br>I find this is where someone who cares enough to be "direct" and honest is handy. Folks who are willing to risk the sometime pain of honest intimacy are rare. When you find them, treasure them more than all else. <br><br>I fall prey to the vanity of introspection too often and avoid the pain of extrospection more so.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2010 at 3:48 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Simon H - <br><br>When I've been in a situation like that, I've found these Do It Tomorrow principles to be helpful:<br><br>(1) Declare a backlog.  Take all of those clients and other work that you are so behind on, and put them in a pile somewhere off to the side.  (Figuratively or literally, your choice!)  :-)   This becomes your Backlog.  DO NOT ADD to this backlog -- it is a Closed List.<br><br>(2) Stay current on all new incoming work.  If necessary, adjust your systems for processing work, so you can actually do this.  Otherwise you'll soon have a NEW backlog.<br><br>(3) Your Backlog becomes your "Current Initiative".  That means, first thing every day, work on your backlog -- for at least N minutes, where you decide ahead of time how much N will be (keep it consistent).  In this way, the backlog will get smaller every day.  This is encouraging and makes you want to just get it done.<br><br><br>This approach has really helped me dig out of some deep holes.  Maybe it will help you, too.<br><br>If I were a client in a situation like that, I really wouldn't want you to call me and apologize and tell me it's still going to take longer but you can't give me a specific date.  I'd rather hear nothing, than get a call like that.<br><br>On the other hand, if you do have clients calling and complaining, you can put them at the top of your Backlog pile.  This can help you estimate when you can actually have their work done, so you can know what to tell them.   <br><br>I don't think clients are interested in why you've been procrastinating, or that you are struggling to fix it.  They really just want results.  At least, when I am a client, that's what I want.  But I'm an INTJ and we're kinda weird, from what I hear.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2010 at 5:15 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am going to come at this from a slightly different perspective.  Quite frankly if you are in danger of missing important tax deadlines for your clients your entire practice and livelihood is at risk.  I would immediately hire someone to come in an help you get the work done.  Yes, it will impact your profit for this year, but if you have a bunch of dissatisfied client your profit will suffer next year when they leave you.  You may find that your strength is in marketing and client service and not in cranking out the work and actually scale up your practice making it more profitable in the long run. <br><br>This problem will not be solved by making lists, it will be solved by some tough reflection and planning.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2010 at 14:48 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim<br><br>&lt;&lt;I'm an INTJ and we're kinda weird&gt;&gt;<br><br>See Seraphim, we have a lot in common.

IBM paid for me to get tested and learn MBTI for a week ... but I saw no evidence that it made any better use of my unique talents as exposed by my typing.  Companies like to waste money that way.<br><br>Next, realize that personality type can be (at least in some limited range) contextual.  At work I usually acted as an "E" ... but I actually tested as an "I".  I was tested by an "official" tester (LOL ... what a scam that is ;-) but she was good and worked hard at getting it right.  And that made loads of sense.  I HAD to be an "E" at IBM, I mean, nothing else would have worked.  I was making sales presentations and giving classes and running teams.  So what you appear to be and what you really are may be two different things.<br><br>Next, realize that all theories of personality are just that ... theories ... to the extent that they try to explain anything.  MBTI simply DESCRIBES ... it does not do much explaining.  And you have to admit, don't you, that people are different and you need a way to put that difference in words.  In your post you describe nurses as caring.  O.K. fine.  Then you call them SJs.  Still fine.  Who cares how you label them just so we understand you?  MBTI gives a language to personality observations that is more rich than just "caring" or "selfish" or "solitary".<br><br>Another thing to consider is that if you work at it, you can make any system that describes personality work for you.  IOW, I have seen people adept in astrology and palmistry, and reading tea leaves get as close to nailing how I feel about life as any other personality system.  It has more to do with the ability to perceive and project, than anything else.  A lot of factors are working here.<br><br>Jacqueline suggests you look into the Enneagram of Personality, if you have not already done so.  I concur. I like it better as a way to explain personality and it is at least as good as MBTI to describe it.  It is more dynamic than the MBTI in that it has associated spiritual practices to help you "move" along the path of personal growth.  (Basically not get stuck in the weaker attributes of your "type" and build on the stronger ones.)  It is also somewhat more mystical in its history ... being linked to Sufi mystics and the Jesuit priesthood.  Be that as it may, it has given me a much better predictor of future behavior than MBTI, though I find MBTI works reasonably well.  But even on the basis of parsimony, nine types are better than 16 ... if the nine explain it all.<br><br>But then Mark calls me a closet mystic myself ... so ... back to my tea leaves.  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2010 at 8:03 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This seems so typical of this forum.
