With RevAF, my production has gone up but it's a little frustrating to watch my list grow and grow. I track my open tasks every morning. So I was thinking about doing the audit proceedure. If after 3-4 days, my number of tasks has grown, I would go through the list and prune/dismiss some of the items. Your thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 14:10 | Ron Hoop</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sounds like the time frame might be too short.

However I am beginning to wonder if the fascination with statistics (which I certainly have myself) could detract from the "purpose" of AF.  If we go back to the advantages of original AF, the main benefits people noticed were (a) the achievement of a higher number of tasks without procrastination and (b) the ability of the system to enable genuinely important tasks to be actioned and genuinely unnecessary tasks to be put aside.  The emphasis on allowing the system to grade (and ultimately dismiss) tasks was a key factor.<br><br>It seems to me that the desire to keep our new lists "lean and mean" could cause us to start our own forms of preselection by restricting task entry, or removing the filtering options by dismissing early for the wrong reasons.<br><br>Just a thought ..... or two .....:-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 21:58 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt; beginning to wonder if the fascination with statistics<br><br>Christine - I've wondered the same thing. To date, I care about only two stats:<br><br>1) How much time I spent working from my AF list <br>2) How much time I spent doing quad 2 activity (high quality)<br>3) How much time I spent doing quad 4 activity (web surfing, etc)<br><br>I do this by using Chronolite-lite ( a free timer app for the iPhone). One timer is entitled "quad 2", and another "quad 4). Whenever I'm working from my lists, I hit the quad 2 timer. When I switch to web surfing &amp; email, I trigger the quad 4 timer. At the end of the week, I have a general idea if I'm moving goals forward, or being a slack-ass.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 22:24 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine:<br><br>From reading the posts on this forum, it seems that the mental focus produced by RAF is totally different from AF1.  As you say, the emphasis in RAF is on keeping the list 'lean and mean', either by filtering tasks before writing them down or dismissing them very rapidly afterwards.  AF1 allowed everything from 'do the dishes' to 'conquer the world' to be written on the list and to be considered many times before dismissal.  I feel that under RAF many items end up being dismissed automatically.  <br><br>So far as I understand it, the reason these changes were made was to solve the problem of people focussing too much on 'important' tasks on early pages and missing 'urgent' ones later in the list.  Personally I felt this was dealt with very well by the common sense rule.  Perhaps it is just that I have no problem dealing with urgent and immediate tasks, whereas I need lots of help to face up to the long-festering but very important tasks.  But whatever the reason, I feel that AF1, applied little and often!,  helped me overcome my own obstacles and begin to make progress, whereas RAF just encourages me at the things I find easy already.  In other words, it becomes a standard to-do list, with older items dropping off the end, day by day.<br><br>All the above must be read with the proviso that I haven't been much of a success at any version of AF!  I just know that AF1 did at least make me use mental 'muscles' that I had never used before and RAF doesn't.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 22:26 | acedia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>BTW, the above should have read "to date, I care about only THREE stats".<br><br>Also, I don't use timers for any items occurring outside of AF. Why? Because I'm trying to measure mindfulness, as well as general productivity (quad 2) or not (quad 4). Regardless, when working from my AF list, I'm automatically more mindful then when I'm not.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 22:30 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt; and RAF doesn't. <br><br>Which is why I've settled on AF2, and haven't looked back.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 22:32 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ron:<br><br>Oops, apologies for replying to Christine and not to your original question!<br><br>Why do you think this is happening?  If you are dismissing the first contiguous block of unactioned tasks every day, the list should be getting shorter at one end, even while it is growing at the other.  Is there a temporary increase in workload at the moment?  Or could you be seeing an apparent increase in tasks because you are writing down more steps for each project you are currently working on?<br><br>I guess the audit procedure could help, but is it really any better than reviewing the dismissed items - which you will have quite a lot of, sooner or later!  What is the advantage of removing items from the list before you have had a chance to consider doing them?<br><br>Obviously, everyone's needs are different - if you are in a very fast moving work environment and cannot wait for the list to take its own course, then drastic pruning may be the answer, perhaps even every day rather than waiting three or four.  <br><br>Good luck with whatever you decide to try!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 22:44 | acedia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum:<br><br>Do you mean that AF2 works best for you?  I only tried it for a couple of days before RAF came out, so I may be wrong, but doesn't it have the same tendencies as RAF, to focus on the more recent items at the expense of the older ones?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 23:05 | acedia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like how Acedia has articulated the difference in his/her experience between AF1 and RAF. Admittedly I haven't tried RAF my self - just studied the responses on the forum. I wanted to at first, but reading the instructions it didn't really appeal to me. At face value it seems more like a really effective way to manage a todo list. <br><br>What I like about the original AF was that it invites a wider body of items into the list to be processed in its own way, ideas, tasks, maybes, urgent items, random thoughts. There was no pressure to process items in any particular way, no forced dismissal, no forced 'sell-by-dates'.  That allowed for a more creative/psychological approach. Since I have a lot (pages and pages) of actionable items that involve thought work, creativity and a large range of how I might be able to apply them, it suits me better than the later editions of AF. <br><br>But in fact, I have been using my own system/approach for a couple of months now, which has been working great for me personally. But the interesting thing is, since AF I have accustomed myself to being able to list every single actionable item or idea in a single long list. I've found this to be a great place to do an audit. I'll just look through all the different things I've put in the tank so to speak. I can evaluate items 'as I feel like'/'they feel ready for further inspection' and investigate whether they need doing, why I might be feeling resistant, or in what areas I might be overcommitting etc. <br><br>So ironically, instead of having adopted any of the AF approaches as a system in itself, I'm using some of its ideas as an auditing/reviewing tool.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 August 2009 at 0:23 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Peter, I agree that the approach to task management learned from AF is highly transferable to whatever approach you use. I wonder if the difference in preference is where you want to see the unactioned tasks? Do you want them on one big list with everything? Use original AF. Do you want them out of sight until you're ready to review them? Use associated lists or rapid dismissal the way Mike does. Do you want them fairly visible but you want them dismissed at a faster rate than AF1? Use AF2 or RAF. I don't think any of these approaches is "wrong." I think the most valuable aspect of AF for me has been little and often and getting credit for work done, regardless of completion. That is what kept me procrastinating in the past. If I did laundry for an hour, but couldn't mark it as "complete," I felt cheated. No wonder I didn't want to do laundry! Well, there may be another reason. LOL<br><br>Avrum, LOL about your time-keeping categories. I have done this in way more detail.

Nice to see it done with such art ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 August 2009 at 17:54 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>RE: Mel and Mike<br>Again that seems like another good articulation of the differences between the different AF approaches. The problem (well I don't really consider it a problem), is that I like to view unactioned items in every way possible. With a paper based approach this hard to do (and I rely much on my electronic solution). Before AF I didn't view my entire list in such a way. But if you're using software solutions, there's no reason why you can't easily look at your task lists in any way you feel is useful. <br><br>For instance, when I'm deciding on what to do next, I don't want to particularly come across random tasks of projects, because depending on the space I'm in, they might not be relevant in the moment. But that randomness is unavoidable, because tasks are entered one after the other in linear fashion. And paper doesn't sort and filter out things. Now with short to medium sized lists, this isn't really an issue, but with the longer lists as some of have it is. <br><br>Some times I want to look at the tasks I have for a specific project, other times I want to quickly look at tasks that don't require a lot of mental effort and I definitely need to be able to quickly see what tasks are critical to doing. Sometimes I want to go through the whole inventory. Some times I want to audit my commitments. There's no reason why this can't be done at a click of a button.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 August 2009 at 19:10 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm using RAF pretty much "as written", and it's working great for me.<br><br>Lately, I've been buried with urgent tasks, and the Reverse Mode handles that very well.  When I have a few minutes breather, I might switch to Forward Mode to remember what's "on notice" there.  Sometimes I've actioned those things, other times they got put on review.  But I'd switch back to Reverse Mode for most of the day.<br><br>Today I was stuck waiting for someone to do something, and had some "down time" where I couldn't move forward on my main, urgent tasks.  So naturally, Forward Mode felt ready to do, and I switched.  I spent an hour or two working through my older and middle pages, and it was very productive.  I got a lot of items done, and cleared several old pages.  (It always feels great to clip off that upper-right corner of the page, which is how I indicate the page is cleared.)<br><br>It was fun to be working in forward mode like that.  It "felt" just like doing AF1.  The dismissal process is totally different, of course, but it still had the same "thoughtful" and intuitive feel to it.  The items just "felt" either ready to be done, or "time to delete this one, I'm never going to do that", or "hmm, let's wait and see how the system handles it".  It was very natural and worked very well.<br><br>But then, I ran across a page with nothing that wanted to be done, so back to Reverse Mode.  Just in time to get back on those urgent items!<br><br>So, I'm not sure I agree with Mel and Mike's characterization of AF1, AF2, and RAF.  The thing I want, is a single place to put everything, a single "master control list" that I can rely on.  So, everything goes on the list.  But, I still use second lists, project lists, shopping lists, lists of related tasks that don't make sense as one-off items randomly scattered across AF.  Those work great for me.  With RAF.  <br><br><br>With new project-related tasks that appear, I deal with them in different ways.  <br><br>(1) Put it in the project folder.  Make sure the project itself is listed on AF.  <br><br>(2) Put in on AF.  Usually when I don't remember what project it's part of, or don't want to think that hard right now because I'm moving too fast working on something else.<br><br>(3) Put it both on AF and also in the project folder.  I do that when it's related to a project, but I want that task to get more special attention.  Usually seeing that task in AF will remind me to go pay attention to the project as a whole.  <br><br>So, to Peter's point:  I find that this method gives me more than enough "sorting and filtering" -- way better than I've done previously with task-management software like Toodledo, RTM, or Outlook.<br><br><br>Regarding the topic at hand -- the audit procedure. It's been a long time since I read the DIT book, and I don't remember the details of the audit procedure, and what it's supposed to accomplish.  <br><br>But here are some thoughts anyway.  :-)<br><br>I stopped keeping AF metrics months ago.  It was just too much overhead and not much benefit in return.  I do review my whole list sometimes -- or parts of it -- but haven't found any really useful ways to quantify it.<br><br>I really like "dashboards".  Whenever I'm tracking something, such as the status of all the bugs on a piece of software, or the number of completed documents per quarter per tech writer, or the current status of particular sectors of the stock market, or whatever -- I always like trying to find ways to distill that down into a visual summary that you can view at a glance and get a good feel for what's going on.  <br><br>And I keep pondering, what would a "dashboard" for my AF list even look like?  What kind of parameters would be tracked there?<br><br>A danger with dashboards like this, is you can track all these different parameters, and it all looks very interesting, but maybe it's not even useful.  Maybe you are tracking the number of software bugs that are resolved every month.  And maybe that number keeps going up -- looks like you are making progress!  But what if the number of new bugs goes up even faster?  It suddenly doesn't look so great.<br><br>That's a very simple example, and it can get much more complicated.  Tracking stocks, for instance.  Don't even get me started.  There are countless rabbit trails and false indicators that don't tell you a thing.<br><br>And then, there's Autofocus.  What are the important parameters?  What is it you want the metrics for?  <br><br>To measure overall productivity (how much you get done each day)?  <br><br>To measure how you are spending your time (how much you goof off vs being productive)?   <br><br>To see if your workload is too heavy or too light?<br><br>To track project status?  <br><br>To report to your boss?  <br><br>To report to your spouse?  <br><br>To track progress towards goals?  <br><br><br>The first ones on the list can be measured by counting tasks completed.  It's pretty easy to do, doesn't add much overhead, and gives you a useful (but rough) measurement.  Not as accurate as Avrum's stopwatches.<br><br>But further down the list, it can be harder to quantify with a simple method.  I've been thinking quite a bit about the last one -- progress towards goals.  I do sometimes lose sight of that, a bit too much lost in the details of the trees, not able to see the forest.  I keep trying to think of a simple method you could lay on top of AF to track and measure that.  But I haven't come up with anything yet...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 August 2009 at 1:19 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim, I think you are using AF in the way I outlined. You don't want to see absolutely everything on your main AF list; therefore, you have associated lists/folders as I do. My guess is you like your items to come under review faster than those who stick with original AF.<br><br>As for quantifying the success of AF, you can try to do that with statistics as Mark does and there are times that quantification is helpful and motivating for me. But the best measure for me is peace of mind. If I feel good about what I'm doing and have no fear of things falling through the cracks, that's an awfully good measure for me. With GTD, I just kept adding things to my lists but never did them. I had a horrible sense of unease as I knew that something crucial could be missed because I wasn't even reviewing the tasks. There were too many of them!<br><br>As for goals, I think there's a very simple way to do that using your current approach. You could  do as I do and review your associated lists (projects, errands, etc.) and set goals for the week. Any tasks that help you meet your goals get added to the main list. A second way is to create a separate goals list/folder. When you come to GOALS on your main AF list you can either choose to add tasks to your list that further your goals or you can take that to mean that you should work on those goals right then. For example, if you simply review a list of goals, you might see "Get fit this fall." You may then be prompted to add "research fitness programs" to your main list or you could actually start researching rather than write it down. When you felt done working on your goals, you'd cross off Goals on your main list and re-add it.<br><br>What I love about this approach is you can easily see if you are being goal-directed in your work or not. The closer "GOALS" gets to the line of doom, the more likely it is that you have lost touch with your ambitions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 August 2009 at 5:06 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>Excellent! Bravo! You described the AF process very precisely. At the risk of proving Mike right about thinking everyone should do it my way, : ) , I think you captured the essence of AF ("raf") and how Mr. Forster intended it to function. <br><br>I think you are like me in that I want to "do AF" the way it is laid out first. Maybe I'll make a tweak or two later, but I really want to give it a proper shake down. I think Mr. Forster has put a lot of thought and testing into the system, and so I want to stick with his design.<br><br>Some of the ways one uses AF in conjunction with other tools (like a calendar). . . or ways one fits it into one's life and circumstance. . . seem more the area for personalization (and necessarily so). I like the way you handle projects.<br><br>You had some interesting thoughts about metrics and dashboards, etc. Regarding tracking GOALS. Perhaps one way would be to make some sort of notation before each item when it is crossed out (actioned). The notation could be a symbol, or a colored dot, or an abbreviation for one of your goals. Then, each week or month you would tally up all the times you performed an action related to one of your goals.<br><br>For instance, if one of your goals is to be more frugal, perhaps whenever you action an item that relates to that goal (say signing up for a savings account, or clipping coupons, or fixing a leaky spigot, etc) you put a green dot, or a dollar sign, or the letter code FR in the left margin.<br><br>What do you think?<br>--Joseph</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 August 2009 at 6:07 | Joseph</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Peter,<br><br>Yes, I agree, a push of a button is fine.

But, I still use second lists, project lists, shopping lists, lists of related tasks that don't make sense as one-off items randomly scattered across AF. Those work great for me. With RAF.   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Just so you understand my situation ... I'm not sure I know what you mean by how I characterize the various incarnations of AF, but my goal is the same as your and I also get there my way.<br><br>- My list is my master list<br>- Everything goes on it<br>- I keep it small by fast dismissal but I can still get to everything<br>- Eventually dismissed get rolled out to other lists where the are quickly available to me in a more meaningful context.<br><br>Just to clarify in case I had not been clear.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 August 2009 at 15:46 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Having had very little AF for the past week it has been interesting to see that, although my progress has slowed down, my number of active items has still reduced.  I agree with the comments regarding statistics in that it can be hard to measure exactly what defines "progress" but I suspect we all have a sense of what "progress" means to us - and that that meaning may actually not be constant.  For example, my statistics have created their own motivation, in that I wanted to reduce my items further, but also have encouraged me to clear out my "pre AF2" items.  As I have posted elsewhere I am more likely to enter a whole project rather than its' constituent parts, which of course naturally keeps task numbers lower, but I can see that in AF1 I was more likely to enter task steps to ensure that a task was definitely recorded and kept in mind, whereas RAF does that by the return to the end of the list.<br><br>I feel I now need to start adding to my lists as I have fewer items than I would like for choice but the trouble is that when I add new tasks I do them so they're gone by the end of the day - hmmm.......  a to do list of items that get done - whatever next?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 August 2009 at 22:02 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ron, I'm just replicating Mark's blog article from March, 2008 as I found it to be very good advice:<br><br>"So how do we go about auditing our work?<br><br>The most important principle is that you don’t audit tasks, you audit the projects and commitments from which those task have come.<br><br>The easiest way to do this is to enter all the tasks you are behind with into an outliner or mindmapper. If you have failed to complete the tasks in your Task Diary for four or more days (which is the signal for carrying out an audit), then your are probably going to have quite a number. Now group them together under projects, so that you end up with a hierarchy of commitments.<br><br>The next stage is to look at the projects. Your aim is to cut the number of projects you have committed yourself to so that you have time to do all of them as well as they deserve. In order to do this you need to identify exactly what your real work is. If you are self-employed this will be the work that impacts the bottom line. If you are an employee it’s the reason why your employer thinks it worthwhile paying your salary.<br><br>Of course this audit can apply just as much to your private life as to your work life. What are the projects and commitments which are going to take forward your life goal and vision?"<br><br>Here's the article in its entirety:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/3/11/too-much-work.html">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/3/11/too-much-work.html</a><br><br>Ron, if you do a big, ruthless dismissal and make hard commitments to certain projects over others as Mark advises in the article, you might find you stop writing so much down.  That's been my experience.  I had to do three big purges to get it down to what I was really committed to.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 August 2009 at 5:16 | Jacqueline</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
