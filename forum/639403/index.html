But I'm still confused about one point.  In this earlier thread, Mark wrote:<br><br>"You are not dismissing the whole page. Most of the time you would be dismissing one or two items which had been hanging around for a long time and were stuck."<br><br>But it sounds to me like you are dismissing a whole page, or at least all undone items on a page if none of them stand out to you?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2009 at 15:41 | Amanda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, you're dismissing a whole page, and all the items on it. But typically, you've worked that page repeatedly before you get to the point of dismissing things, and there are probably only a few items left.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2009 at 16:41 | Beth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You can find more answers to this topic here:<br><br>FAQs<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/627319">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/627319</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2009 at 22:50 | Silvia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Surely some things are still important, or maybe even urgent, but you just can't face doing them.  They might have been on the list for so long that you just can't stand to look at them any more.  Some things just can't be dismissed.  I speak from experience.  There are things that I just haven't done and probably won't do, but they're still at the back of my mind.  And I know that I have to do something before they go away.  Does anyone have any advice?  I could just do these things but realistically I won't.  If I employed AF I could dismiss them simply because the system says I can.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2009 at 23:01 | Sandy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The beauty about AF is that you only have to start a task to cross it off. If you haven't finished it, you just write it again at the end of the list.<br><br>So you just need to do something small and usually when faced with the choice of doing something, anything on the project and dismissing it, suddenly doing something small doesn't seem so bad. It could even be look at the project and think of one small thing to do to write at the end of AF.<br><br>You'll find that most times, the resistance to looking at as task is even bigger than doing it so what AF does is breaks down the initial resistance and often the work flows from that. Even if it is still painful, at least if you're chipping away at it, eventually it will get to the point where it becomes easy to finish which is far more progress than just ignoring it.<br><br>Yesterday, I was coming to the end of one of my pages and I had a task I'd been procrastinating on for a while and could easily have procrastinated on for another week or more. I forced myself just pull out the files and do 1 thing. I ended up spending 2 hours on it and now my resistance to going back to it (it's a several day task) is much smaller if none at all. As I hadn't finished, it went back on the end of my AF list. I can't wait to get to it again when it turns up - THAT's progress!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2009 at 23:33 | Catherine CS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sandy:<br><br>"Some things just can't be dismissed...

But sometimes, as soon as that timer beeps, I sigh with relief, copy the item forward, and move on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2009 at 3:29 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Actually - at least as I understand Mark - this is the intention of AF. If you don't at least start working on the last item of the page, why is it on the list anyway?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2009 at 14:52 | Christian Gaertner</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>And, honestly, even if you 'dismiss' the page, you haven't ripped the page out of the book and thrown it into the trash. The task is still there, written down, if you wish to review it later. A task of "review dismissed pages" could remind you to review them at some point in the future, if you wish to be reminded of them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2009 at 15:48 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Amanda<br><br>Have you tried rephrasing any of those tasks that you don't want to dismiss? It is fine to rephrase a task, enter it onto the last page and cross it out from the page it was on. I have found if I have a task on my list such as "Do xyz" and I find myself completely resisting it I often rephrase it to "think about xyz" or in the most desperate case you could try "think about why I'm resisting xyz". <br><br>It may seem a very vague thing to write but I find that is the beauty of Autofocus. It seems to let you mull over things like that in the back of your mind while working on other things and when you return to the list and see "think about xyz" often something will have shifted and you can see a way over, round or through a task. Or at the very least realised why you're resisting it and perhaps come up with a partial solution for the resistance.<br><br>Try it and see?<br><br>Good luck</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2009 at 15:57 | Hannah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>At <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626358,">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626358,</a> Lenore's one-paragraph definition of AF on January 15, 2009 at 10:44 has  "if the first slow pass yields nothing, set aside the whole page for later evaluation".  <br><br>I find this most helpful; it "later evaluation" is less emotionally loaded than "dismissing".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2009 at 18:00 | David C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Question: If the only task left on a page is something that you want to do today, but you just can't do it right now, should you move on to the next page and do said item later and out of order, dismiss it, or stop working your lists until you can do said task. I've found that I am using option #3 which isn't the best for productivity! I'm interested in what Mark says. Is there a 4th option of scheduling it in your planner for today and crossing it off the list?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2009 at 4:49 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel<br><br>I would use the "common sense" rule, i.e. leave the item on the list and do it later.  For instance, I have an item "Ring John on Monday, 2 Feb".  It is not time specific so it does not go into my diary/calender.  But it is vital that I do it early next week.  So the best place to leave it is on the list.  The only other item remaining on that page is "Buy printer inks".  The supplier is 5km away and it has been over 40degrees C. outside all this week and it is not super urgent.  So I'm leaving both items on the list rather than dismissing them.  Common sense to me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2009 at 6:26 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jim, that is exactly how I approach the items and i am finding that it works very well. I think the key is for us to not get too hung up about wanting to dismiss/close a page on our lists. Clearly it is important that we progress, but i have a couple of pages which are very close to being "finished" and are not because of the type of circumstance you outline, i.e. the time is not right to do them. So hence when the time is right, they will get done and then the page will be closed.<br><br>Incidentally i do also have one page which only has two VERY HIGH resistance items on there, and I have now taken Hannahs suggestion to rephrase them this morning, and guess what, I have actually made a small amount of progress on each...brilliant....not sure what I was making all the fuss about :-) I will now see if the resistance starts to build again or whether by taking the very small step (in one case just getting out some papers) will encourage further progress.<br><br>Thanks everyone for the contributions here, the forum and all its participants have been a great help and very supportive</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2009 at 11:22 | titch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel:<br><br>My recommendation here would be to dismiss the item and then re-enter it immediately at the end of the list, possibly rephrasing a bit. I would only do this though if I were really convinced that I was actually going to do it today.<br><br>The reason for this is that generally items don't get to the stage where they are likely to be dismissed until they have been on the page for some time and multiple opportunities to do them have passed. In other words items very seldom get dismissed by accident.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2009 at 8:40 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting thread, again.<br><br>As I work abroad on my work assignments, my contexts/places are pretty well-defined, I have a Defer To Later tag because I cannot do them whilst on assignment even if I wanted to.<br><br>Example: Internet access is so slow and fragile here in southern Zambia, iI am not going into my company's online bank and credit card accounts to monitor activities.  So I've deferred them and set a reminder in Outlook to bring them back to the attention of my AF system.  These particular items, along with several others, will reappear on Friday evening next week when I have a six hour stopover with free wi-fi access in Johannesburg on my way home.<br><br>So I check these items off  now and don't worry about them because my own AF hybrid is tracking them.<br><br>My procrastination trap is those on which I cannot make a conscious decision to Defer, so they sit there until they get Dismissed or Done.<br><br>In case others are wondering about these contexts I use, I have restricted them to a few:<br>@Assignment/Client<br>@Errand (I may ditch this and treat it another way, eg write [ERRAND] next to the task in AF so it stands out when I have time and place for errands, a form of batching if you like.)<br>@Home<br>@Home Office (what used to be a spare bedroom, most personal tasks are under the previous one)<br>@Travel/Airport/Lodge<br><br>When i get back, I' hoping to put more into and get more out of the forum, and try using AF as others have suggested, as a filter to set up a DIT-type Close List.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2009 at 13:38 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Mark.
