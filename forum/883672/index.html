However, Mark has put a lot of thought into the mechanics of all these systems, and I'm not sure I fully appreciate all the nuances of the rules and what kind of side effects might be triggered by subtle rule-changes.  Hence, my questions, below...)<br><br>Mark, I have a question.  Do you think it will change the psychology of the AF4 system, if I redraw The Line between the Backlog and the Active List, not waiting till nothing Stands Out in the Backlog, but just because my Active List is getting a bit long?<br><br>Since starting AF4 Friday afternoon (Pacific Time), I've cleaned up a good percentage of the countless hundreds of tasks in my Backlog.  I actually went through the whole thing three or four times, looking at every item (and several more times, just skimming &amp; skipping).  I had only done that two or three times in the last month, with RAF.<br><br>Meanwhile, I've added 285 items to my Active List.  Of these, I have completed 93.  It's now eight pages long.  <br><br>I've been wondering whether it would upset the mechanics of the system if I just decided, right now, to move the line forward and start over by putting everything in the Backlog.<br><br>The reason for the change would be to make the Active List more responsive to urgency.  It's already starting to get sluggish.<br><br>But I can foresee some side effects.  For example, every time I work through the Backlog, the threat of dismissal on the remaining items increases.  That pressure keeps building, and is one motivation to keep taking action on those items.  If I arbitrarily reset The Line, that pressure is immediately reduced.  That's would certainly be one unintended side effect.  <br><br>It would also put some "fresh" items into the Backlog, keeping it happily cycling for a few more rounds before the Backlog is facing dismissal again.<br><br>So basically, it looks like a trade-off between the responsiveness to urgency for the Active List, versus consistent pressure and progress on the items in the Backlog.  <br><br>Doing this ONCE would probably not matter.  But once I open that door, I could see it becoming a habit, and that would make it a whole different system, probably more like AF2 or RAF in its focus on urgency, and losing the Autofocus effect altogether.<br><br>Any other side effects or other implications that you would foresee?  What do you think about this?  Do you ever do this?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 6:38 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello Seraphim,<br>If I may be bold enough to get in before Mark, I can tell you how I see it.<br>I think to do what you suggest would completely disrupt the power of AF4.<br>If you're feeling frustrated at the size of the active list you can rejoice at the pressure that puts on the backlog.  FINALLY, you must deal with those things you've been ignoring and refusing to make a decision about for too long.  If you don't, you'll start to go crazy.  The frustration you feel will hopefully overcome the by now probably sizable resistance you have to the few remaining tasks.<br>If you want to redraw the new closed list line, fine, but I'd suggest that you MUST then highlight all the outstanding backlog tasks and have one last hard look at them and work out if can really justify putting them back into the active list.  (personally, before I did this I'd go through the list one last time before highlighting and deal with whatever I could).<br>Then, you're sticking with the essence of the rules and getting the most from the system.<br>That's my thoughts.  I'm starting to feel the same tension, but need to enjoy the fact that it's working as intended.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 7:55 | Ben</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yeah, what Ben said.  If you put the backlog on review before moving the line then the system will work as intended ... you'll have to make those hard decisions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 14:20 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've cut my long backlog into three chunks. Arbitrarily. So I am working with 3 backlogs in the moment, and the mechanism is that after going through the open list, I return to the first backlog, cycle it, then to the second... and so on. It's not difficult to figure out the logic according to AF4. <br><br>BUT... this is only intended to be an intermediary solution. I didn't want to start from scratch, but I didn't want my new open list to grow too large, too. In the long run, I want to melt it down to one backlog and one open list.<br><br>I guess today I will come to dismiss the first backlog. As my open list is not yet too long, I will continue it, so I'll be already down to 2 backlogs. Should be a matter of another week to melt the second backlog down, then. <br><br>Maybe not everyboy's solution, but it feels quite natural to me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 15:18 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ben and Mike - Yes, I think you are right.  The hard part is that I still have hundreds of items on my backlog list.  I just don't have time to process them all right now if I highlight them.   And too many of them are too important to just delete en masse.  <br><br>I suppose Mark might say this is one reason he suggests starting fresh with a new list.  But from experience I know that starting fresh won't help me, since I generate new tasks so quickly, and I'd run into this same problem eventually anyway.  (Not to mention all the unfinished important work that's documented in my existing AF list.)<br><br><br>AndreasE - Interesting, I had thought of doing something like that, too, but ultimately I imagined it would probably have the same effect as RAF, where you have moribund middle pages that rarely get seen or acted on.  Do you find that happening?  I was imagining it would go something like this:  (1) Work on Backlog 1 for a cycle or two, then (2) Need to go look at the Active List to see what urgent items are there, so quickly touch one item each in Backlog 2 and Backlog 3, leaving them mostly unseen and unprocessed, then (3) Go through Active List once, then (4) Back to cycling through Backlog 1.<br><br><br>What I find myself actually doing:  Once I leave the Backlog cycle, and start processing my Active List, I often skim quickly through the first few pages of the Active List, to get to where my "real" Active List is.   If the Active List gets long enough, this will start behaving a little like RAF -- the first part of my Active List will become my moribund middle pages.  I'll keep going at it, and see how it goes.<br><br>In any case, it's fun to always be one of those people who is stress-testing these AF systems with a large number of tasks.  It quickly reveals the strengths and weaknesses of a particular version.  And so far, AF4 has the strongest strengths and lowest-impact weaknesses of any system I've tried.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 16:08 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I just don't have time to process them all right now if I highlight them. And too many of them are too important to just delete en masse.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>The thing is that there is no downside to deleting them.  They don't go anywhere.  They stay in the book, highlighted with a line through them and you can see them any time you want.<br><br>The point of this, or any other time management system is to keep you focused on what you can and want to do right now.  Once that is done, you go fetch new things to work on.<br><br>You could even look at the idea of a "second level" backlog.  A backlog that does not get visited except once week.  So, for example, you "close the backlog" (put tasks on review) then copy crucial ones to the end of the open list and work between the OLD line and the NEW line (as the closed list) and the new line and the end as the closed list, as usual.<br><br>Now being as astute as you are ;-) you can see that the only change is that you don't draw a line through the tasks.  But maybe that will put you at ease enough so that you can let go of that large backlog and free yourself to focus on what you can do today.  Dunno, just a thought ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 16:18 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;I imagined it would probably have the same effect as RAF, where you have moribund middle pages that rarely get seen or acted on. Do you find that happening?&lt;&lt;<br><br>No. It happened with RAF, but now on the contrary, I come around my whole list at least once a day. I do, however, work through in this order: Cycle Backlog 1, cycle Backlog 2, cycle Backlog 3, then one pass through the open list. And I try to keep in mind to rather hurry up... :-)<br><br>These days, I don't have that much urgent items - thats helpful. One should not change the system during an state of emergency, I'd say.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 16:35 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>I'm beginning to wish that I'd not used the word backlog in my preliminary instructions, and I think I will definitely drop it when I do the re-write. I think it gives the wrong impression of what is supposed to happen. AF4 is supposed to encourage rapid movement through the list, not getting bogged down in "backlogs".<br><br>I will used "closed" and "open" list.<br><br>If you are feeling that the open list is getting too long, the last thing you want to do is to make it into closed list prematurely. That will just remove the effect of the closed list. In that case you might just as well have one open list and just select whatever you feel like doing off it.<br><br>Rather the fact that your open list is getting too long should be a signal to get the closed list out of the way. Since you yourself have said that you put far more things on the list than you are ever going to succeed in doing, I suggest you engage in wholesale dismissal. That way AF4 is doing what it's supposed to do: enabling you to deal with urgent stuff quickly, and filtering out the unnecessary stuff.<br><br>Another approach would be to do what Mike does and apply a pre-filter to what you put on the list. If I remember correctly his is to only put on the list things which he really believes he will do over the next week.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 18:35 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AndreasE<br><br>&lt;&lt; So I am working with 3 backlogs in the moment, and the mechanism is that after going through the open list, I return to the first backlog, cycle it, then to the second... and so on. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I don't see what the point of this is. It doesn't seem to increase access to the urgent items at the end of the Active List, quite the reverse. If you want multiple backlogs and are not worried about urgent tasks, why not just stick with AF1?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 18:43 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re: Pre-filter.  Yes, exactly.<br><br>The entire purpose of any time management system is to manage the work you need to do so as to fit it into the time available.  The key is "the time available".  If you had infinite time then you would not need a time management system.  Nor would you if you had no time available. Nor would you if you had nothing to do.  The problem you seem to be having is that you have SOME time available and LOT (for all practical purposes an infinity) to do.  The problem is not with the system, but the constraints of being human, I guess ;-)<br><br>The only way I know of to right that situation is to change the way you work in a fundamental way.  I.E. do not try to do more than you can POSSIBLY do.  That is where the filter comes in.  Have SOME filter about what goes on the list.  Mine is what I can do this week.  (I chose a week because I do a weekly review and it fits in with that.)  I would suggest that you use the time frame of how long before you do a review.<br><br>There is absolutely no point in putting things into the time management system which you KNOW you will not get to.  Now that said, I know Mark uses AF as the filter itself.  I can see where that works if your way of working matches that.  But even then, Mark does not put things on his list that he KNOWS he will not get to ... nor does he have many pages ... you've seen how long his list was a couple of days ago.  All of that stuff seems to be "current" for him.  And moreover, if you did exactly what Mark does you should be satisfied with a list hundreds of pages long ... the system would be filtering it for you, right?  ;-)<br><br>Another way to look at this is that time management systems have overhead.  You are experiencing the overhead of reading long lists because everything goes on the list.  That is just the cost of that kind of "filtering".  The cost of my kind of filtering is that I have to stop and think about an item before it goes on the list.  "Pay me now or pay me later."  ;-)<br><br>I put my filter in place because I have an unrealistic sense of what I can accomplish and so the list grew like a fungus.  Once I consciously filtered it with a reality check, things quieted down.  Now I do NOT finish everything on my list ... that would be too much to hope for.  But at least I can say that everything on my list has a fair chance to be done, and if not, it will roll over and get done next week.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 19:11 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike: Question--you have mentioned that your AF list (any version, I think) is the Grass Catcher for all things that occur to you. I must not have that right based on the above post. The question is if you only place things on the list that you think might get done in a week, what do you do with all those other pieces of grass?? Where do THEY go so as to not loose them? <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 20:23 | Beth L</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thought folks might be interested in how I started AF4.  I had hundreds of tasks on various lists.  I started per the instructions, drew a line etc.  Then I read Mike's post on projects.  I bit the bullet and went thru all my old cr*p and did something on each task, binned it or put it on a separate project list.  Oddly I then went to the project lists and consolidated all the simple projects back onto the AF4 list.  I have cut out a vast number of number of tasks.  Now my AF4 list sits on about 2 pages of an A4 notebook.  System is working well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 21:13 | Man of Kent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Man,<br><br>Hey, that is great.  I found similar good results when I did that.  Feels wonderful ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 22:55 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Beth,<br><br>In brief (a unique idea for me ;-)<br><br>1. Pre-AF, I had a grass catcher notebook open at all times as I used my other TM systems.<br><br>2. With AF, I put everything on the list and got into trouble because the list grew too large.  I did not understand why.  I did not notice that I had dropped my grass catcher notebook.  I was so intent on AF that I completely missed that fact.<br><br>3. My frustration caused me to rework my WHOLE system.  I mean the whole thing ... from the ground up.  In doing that it became obvious that AF was not just a To Do list but ALSO a grass catcher.  AH, there's the problem.<br><br>The solution was obviously to start up my grass catcher book again.  But I did not want to run two books.  What to do ... what to do ;-)   I finally hit on the solution of the "challenge question".  "Am I comitted to doing this thing THIS week?"  If not, I did not want it on my list.  So I hit on the obvious.  What happens to tasks that you won't do in AF?  The are dismissed.  So I FIRST write all tasks on the AF list THEN I ask the quesiton and then if the answer is "No, I'll not do this in the coming week." I dismiss the task instantly.  This gives me the record of the task as it lives on forever task on the AF list.  But since it is dismissed, I whiz right by it as I process the list.  Eventually, it sinks back into oblivion until I do a (monthly, usually) review of dismissed tasks.<br><br>What do I do then?  Mostly nothing.  I turns out that these things come up again and again.  It does no harm to just let them sit there until they make sense.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 23:15 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike--you really have come up with an interesting way to "work the system", so to speak. One thing I like about AF is that I have a record/list of all those things that I don't get done, but may at a later day. But it had never occurred to me that I could take a random idea or task and put it on the list, knowing I will not likely get to it soon. Delete it so I don't have to review it a bunch of times. Yet, it has been captured for some action in the future, or not...<br>Interesting. <br>So in this way do you see/use AF as a someday/maybe list as well? <br><br>Beth L<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 8:17 | Beth L</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, this is really interesting. <br>It looks like using AF on two different timescales : the short term AF is the normal way, which you review every day, and then you have a long term list : the dismissed items, that you review every month.<br>It does create a someday / maybe list spread all over the closed pages, but easily accessible for review / re-activating.<br>All that in only one tool. Smart. I think that's what Mark had in mind when he suggested to highlight dismissed items so that they can be reviewed, but it rang a bell in my mind when you described the way you make it work. <br>I love the power of AF's simplicity.<br>And all the exchanges of ideas done on this forum are highly valuable as well.<br><br>Alex<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 9:25 | Alexborne</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Beth, Alex,<br><br>Yes, that is exactly it.  It only dawned on me that Mark's AF was a combo of To Do and grass catcher (someday/maybe) combined, when I could not figure out why my list was so large and sluggish.  I had all of these someday/maybe things on my list and they were getting underfoot.   All they needed was to be dismissed instantly for all to be well.<br><br>And note, that you can do something else ... lately I have not bothered, but you CAN cull them into a separate someday/maybe list when you review ... and you can then delete the obviously nutty ones.  In addition, some of the long term ones that are really valid, can go into your project lists ... like ideas about a project that you are not ready to work on yet.  Lots of possibilities.  Mostly the value is that you are working only from one list during the day and your flow is not interrupted by getting out another list to put these things on.  You just keep on trukin'  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 10:27 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark wrote:  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm beginning to wish that I'd not used the word backlog in my preliminary instructions, and I think I will definitely drop it when I do the re-write...

They are often useful, and always interesting.  :-)<br><br>Mike wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;The thing is that there is no downside to deleting them. They don't go anywhere. They stay in the book, highlighted with a line through them and you can see them any time you want.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>But then I still need to go review them sometime.  I like the AF4 "forced review" better. <br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;The point of this, or any other time management system is to keep you focused on what you can and want to do right now. Once that is done, you go fetch new things to work on.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, and pretty much everything in my list COULD (and maybe SHOULD) be actioned NOW.  If I run across something and think, "I don't want to bother with that right now, maybe next month", then it goes off the list and onto my tickler.  <br><br>But the promise of AF (all versions) is to help you focus on what's important to be doing NOW.  I want AF to do the filtering as much as possible.  Generally it works just fine, but I just have lots of things to filter and it sometimes slows down the works.<br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;You could even look at the idea of a "second level" backlog. A backlog that does not get visited except once week.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Oy, that just sounds too complicated.  Too many moving parts and it's sure to break.  For me, at least.<br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;There is absolutely no point in putting things into the time management system which you KNOW you will not get to.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, of course.  I don't put things into the list that I KNOW I will not get to.  I put things in the list that COULD (and maybe SHOULD) be done NOW (or in the next couple of days).  <br><br>But I like to let AF help sort out the SHOULD part.<br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Now that said, I know Mark uses AF as the filter itself.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, exactly.  That seems to be one of the main benefits of AF, at least for me, and I don't want to lose it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 18:55 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I too have a long closed list, as a result of taking into AF4 an existing list of about 400 tasks.  I therefore share the problem that my open list is growing and is likely to continue to grow before I can clear the backlog.  I too had thought of tipping some of the open list into the closed list, or dividing the closed list into portions. <br><br>I accept the reasons given why those are poor ideas.  But I think there is one thing that one can do that is consistent with the spirit of AF4, though not actually provided for in the rules.  One can voluntarily, rather than compulsorily, mark a number of the oldest tasks for deletion each day. That then encourages the weeding out of tasks that arguably one ought to be weeding anyway without this mechanism,but in practice is not happening.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 23:04 | David C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>All - I think the AF4 system is great!  It's excellent for things that need to get done today or soon.  But what about all the other lists.  I've seen mention in these forums about putting things that have deadlines on them in Outlook or some calendar program.  What about "books to read," or "things to discuss at the weekly staff meeting," or the "project lists" that I've also seen mentioned?  Is that a binder full of tabbed lists?  Or do you just wait for things to pop back into your head?  My mind only recalls such good information when it's not the appropriate time.<br><br>Thanks so much for exploring this whole process.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 3:07 | s</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>S,<br><br>I find that doing planning outside of AF makes sense.  I plan and have that information (documents, lists, doodles, etc.) in other places.  It could be a tabbed notebook or a Word document, or OneNote, etc.  Does not matter.  When the time comes for some action, items are moved from there to AF for action.  Likewise, when I get an idea it goes into AF, and if it is not something I'm going to do now, it is dismissed and moved to the appropriate list.<br><br>It is very helpful to not clutter the AF list with detail.  "Work on Project X" is all that is necessary.  I know to go to the project book and look at what I have to do on project X. Sometimes I'll put "Call Joe (Project X)" down and that works for me as well.  What I do NOT do is put down 20 actions to take on Project X.  That drives me around the bend ;-)<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 8:50 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I too started AF4, and find myself with an 11 pages backlog (errr... closed list), and a (fortunately) slowly growing open list.<br><br>For the moment I feel that the dynamics created by the advancing "dismissal line" of AF3 has completely disappeared. I also miss the genuine pleasure of closing a page in AF1.<br><br>It comes to my mind that all 4 AF systems' benefits and drawbacks show up differently according to the circumstances. Therefore, as all can be worked out from the same template (a list in a notebook), why not allow ourselves to switch from one AF to the other according to the rythm of our work. In my job, there are periods of high urgencies, there are more quiet weeks, there are times when I'm on big projects, times when I'm on small projects.<br><br>Today I have a closed list I find too long, and not so many urgent tasks. I am thinking of working the closed list in AF1 mode, so that I make sure to put forward old stuff. I might switch to AF2 or AF3 when I get much more urgent things coming in, and maybe keep the AF4 systems as the default when I feel balanced between urgent and old stuff.<br><br>Has anyone tried switching AF systems accordong to the circumstances ?<br><br>Alex</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 9:53 | Alexborne</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alex,<br><br>I had not thought about it that way, but I sort of do that.  I'll sometimes spend more time circulating around the open list if I know there are things to do there and that there is not much to do on the open list and I can't quite close it yet.  (Example: I have an appointment on my closed list that I won't get to until tomorrow.  Really, I could calendar it (I have) and just delete it, but it is just as easy to leave it there until complete.<br><br>I suppose I could follow the rules more closely and that would accomplish the same thing.  But it is an interesting idea.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 10:22 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Alex,<br><br>the dynamics of the slowly but steadily moving dismissal line in AF3 is indeed what I miss too. What I've been doing for a day or two now is to treat the first page of the closed list as an AF1-page, and then continue working the list in AF4-style. This helps me to close pages at a more steady pace, instead of in one big sweep at less frequent (and less predictable) moments.<br><br>I have the feeling that with a somewhat shorter list (mine is 220 tasks scattered over 20 pages) I wouldn't need to resort to AF1 in this manner, but so far it gives me back some of the steady dismissal that I really liked about AF2 and AF3.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 14:25 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike,<br><br>The problem I have with the "instant dismissal" method is that one highlights in order to dismiss, thereby making embedded dismissed tasks stand out and draw the eye when one works the list. If I were keeping my list electronically I could "highlight" by greying out...but I'm using pen and paper. I want to find a way of marking dismissed tasks so that they jump out when I want them to, but not when I don't... Any thoughts about this?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 20:23 | Jennifer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I guess you could cross them out, and code them.  I put a code after every task I cross out:<br><br>- D: Dismissed<br>- X: Deleted<br>- W: Worked on<br><br>Or you could put brackets around the task or ... the possibilities are just endless ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 21:36 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jennifer: It is interesting to note that the task one is trying to NOT think about is presenting as the *loudest*. The eye cannot help but see it, as if to say *I know you are trying to get rid of me--for now--but I am still here, lurking in your psyche* every time you go by it!<br><br>Mike's ideas are good, and for sure there are other ways to not have that glaring at you.<br><br>One thing I have started to do with dismissed items is this:<br>-if the task is truly dismissed, requiring no further action at this time, I put an orange HL through it (tho may now find another, less glaring way to do this)<br><br>-if the task is to be re-entered in some fashion onto the open list, I put the orange HL thru it with a dash of green next to it. This tells me I am still intending to take action on it in some fashion. And it forces the completely unactioned upon task to stand out in a different way. It says "you aren't doing anything about me...just want you to keep that in mind"  (my tasks talk to me sometimes :~D  )</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 22:13 | Beth L</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, thanks for the quick response.  So, it sounds like you have a lot of lists.  Do you have one place where you just put down everything you think of?  Like:  call Mom; grocery shop (and grocery list); mow lawn; work on a project (such as:  determine options to provide lighting at dark spot in parking lot (including how to pay for the lights; which contract execution avenue to use; whether solar lights or local electric service or LED lights; etc.)); trim nails; paint hallway.  Then, once you collect EVERY thing, you put it on the separate lists?  Or do you collect it all on separate lists and then only transfer current action items to AutoFocus?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 September 2009 at 0:59 | s</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jennifer, <br>If I understood well the rules, the dimissed highlighted tasks will draw your eyes only one time : when you review the dismissed items. Once you have reviewed them and decided what there destiny would be, the page is closed. You never scan this page again in normal AF4 work, thus they won't stand out visually anymore - except when you review old dismissed items, eg when searching for old may be / someday items in the closed pages. Which is good, because then you want to know easily which tasks were dismissed.<br>I may be wrong, but I think that's what the system is designed for.<br><br>Alex</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 September 2009 at 9:27 | Alexborne</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br>&gt; I finally hit on the solution of the "challenge question". <br>&gt;"Am I comitted to doing this thing THIS week?" <br>&gt; If not, I did not want it on my list.<br><br>This has really got me thinking overnight. I have a large closed list, the result of importing into AF4 a large preexisting list.  I have this morning marked the ones that I am committed to doing in the next few days, and intend to dismiss the whole list in at the end of the week.<br><br>In a sense this is an inversion of the approach to the closed list.  Rather than chipping away at it by doing a few, dismissing a few, and still having much of the list remaining, I am starting with the preconception that it's all going to be dismissed, and picking out the items that do need saving.  I suppose it's equivalent to marking the entire list for review ahead of imminent dismissal.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 September 2009 at 10:41 | David C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>S,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Mike, thanks for the quick response. So, it sounds like you have a lot of lists. &lt;&lt;&lt; <br><br>Not so many.  Other than the main AF4 list, about a half dozen or so.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Do you have one place where you just put down everything you think of?<br><br>Yes, the main AF list.  But if I am not going to actually DO it, and I KNOW that, I dismiss it immediately ... but it has been recorded.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   Like: call Mom; &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>AF List<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; grocery shop &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>AF List<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;(and grocery list);  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>This goes on its own list so when I shop I don't have to hunt through a long list to try to find things.  I have one page with the stores I frequent ad a list of what I need from each one.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; mow lawn;  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>AF List<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  work on a project (such as: determine options to provide lighting at dark spot in parking lot (including how to pay for the lights; which contract execution avenue to use; whether solar lights or local electric service or LED lights; etc.));  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>The AF list would have "Parking Lot Project".  Then I would have a "Parking Lot Project List" which would have the things I'd have to do for that project.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  trim nails; paint hallway. Then, once you collect EVERY thing, you put it on the separate lists? Or do you collect it all on separate lists and then only transfer current action items to AutoFocus?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>It depends.  If I'm going to build a deck, I work from the project list.  The only thing that EVER goes on AF is "Build Deck".  I then do the thinking and outlining and listing on a project list and work from there.  I don't transfer to AF at all, in that case.  What I need to know is that I'm going to work on the deck today.  I don't need to consult AF to know which step I'm going to work on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 September 2009 at 3:10 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David,<br><br>I'm happy I got you thinking.
