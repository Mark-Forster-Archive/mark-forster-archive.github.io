And I realize it's because my list is such a hodge-podge of different types of items (utterly mundane things like taking out the trash;  high stakes activities like editing a story or writing a letter of recommendation;   the need to get my cholesterol checked bumps up against an e-mail that I must write to a colleague;  my girlfriend's birthday present is juxtaposed with a student screenplay that I have to read. Just going down the list I feel a sense of chaos -- rather than a sense of order.   <br>What I liked about DIT was that I could lay out my day and just deal with it. I had a greater sense of control (or at least a greater illusion of control). Has anyone experienced a similar reaction?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 2:05 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Steve,<br><br>I feel the opposite.  I have a feeling of being on top of things because everything is on the list and I know I can quickly get to the most important things soon enough.  I need to manage my cholesterol as well, to pick one of your examples, and that involves diet, exercise, and weight reduction.  I don't have all of those "goals" on the list, but I do have some actions: "Take Walk", for example.  And when I see it, I know that I have to do it  ... now or soon.  I don't feel panic because it will get in the way of buying a gift for my wife ... it won't.  I'll take the walk either before or after I run out to the store to do that.  By the end of the day, both will be crossed out (and "Walk" rewritten) and I'll have moved forward.  Nothing creates peace of mind like moving forward ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 10:07 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Steve, <br><br>I can relate to what you're saying. Maybe it depends on personality to an extent? I just can't sustain a long list for more than about a week. It possibly depends upon how one views the list - a feeling of failure about what's not getting done? Or just seeing the list as possibilities ? I know I tend to feel very overwhelmed with AF in comparison to DIT and I place great expectations on myself. A shorter closed list alleviates this self imposed pressure a little.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 13:24 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm glad it works for you Mike.  This may be a case of "to each his own."  For me, i don't get a sense that everything will be done by the end of the day. Rather I feel that some things may get  done today and some may not - and meanwhile the list keeps growing. I guess what I like about DIT is the ability to say:  These are the nine things I will accomplish today. I find that very calming.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 13:30 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm still learning about this time management thing and just came across this site today (it was pointed out to me to be helpful and it really seems to be!:) I did have some experience with time management and anxiety before though.<br><br>Have been reading the GTD book these days, and it just - caused me anxiety, lol! The thought of actually *doing* some of my maybe-projects..!! (I actually renamed them to be maybe-projects cause they were causing so much anxiety!:)<br><br>I prefer to not see an item that caused anxiety on my weekly list either! <br><br>So I'm now thinking to maybe start separate lists of high-anxiety (with reward!!) and low-anxiety tasks for projects. I'm not sure if dispersing them among other no-relevance/easy stuff would be good, or bad. :)<br>I put some 'mixed' projects on a list with other projects (not bundled together, but with fun stuff inbetween) and it seems to reduce some of the anxiety to actually see them separately. I also put some sub-projects on the list.. <br>I like the idea of autofocus for different things (like personal/home) in different notebooks - I'm sort of thinking A4 pages in folders/binders though<br><br>So not sure if any of this could be helpful to anyone else here, just thought I'd chip in to the discussion! :)<br>Great site, and great forum! :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 20:35 | Layla</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>When I did GTD the system caused me anxiety due to the complexity and my ultimate realization that the time to maintain the system was draining time that could be used to accomplish things.  That said, I actually liked the someday maybe list because I liked the fact I had captured and recorded ideas that may be useful in the future.  Now I do not keep a list, I use an ideas file, wit an item in my system to review the file from time to time.  <br><br>Regarding long lists, personally, a long list is less anxiety provoking for me than the feeling that my lists are incomplete and I may be missing something important, which I guess is an individual issue.<br><br>Gerry<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 September 2009 at 18:32 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry: Exactly!<br><br>Steve:  What I meant to convey was that everything that MUST have gotten done by the end of the day got done ... not everything which could POSSIBLY have gotten done.  IOW, nothing crucial is ever overlooked.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 September 2009 at 0:19 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Anxiety is a real productivity killer. All my procrastination is due to anxiety, I have found. <br><br>With GTD type systems I did feel in control and less anxious about my list - but I just wasnt getting things done - I was oredring and grouping and prioritising like crazy - just not actually doing things.<br><br>So I had a LOT of anxiety in my life - just not coming directly from my list.<br><br>Then I tried Autofocus and the anxiety was there to begin with - I was used to having order and a sense of control. With AF its not there. But I got things done!<br><br>Over time (it took two weeks, using it every day like clockwork) I began to trust AF to work. Then the sense of anxiety went away and was replaced by an amazing sense of freedom. At last I had a system that got things done - and allowed me to throw hundreds of things at it without getting swamped.<br><br>Now I do have one colligue who cannot feel happy with Autofocus - for the reasons you mentioned - she just cannot live with the built-in fuzziness of exactly when things will get done.<br><br>But thats just one person from a set of dozens who I have introduced to Autofocus. Perhaps it really is a matter of different strokes for different folks - but maybe it might just be a matter of giving it time.<br><br>Respect<br>Paul<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 September 2009 at 11:56 | Zytex aka Paul</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm less concerned about "order and control" than I am in establishing a workable rhythm for my day.  When I look at my list, I notice that some items can be done quickly without leaving my desk (i.e. Print out Syllabus for tonight's class, Return e-mail to ______ etc.).  Other items will involve going out  (Drop off shirt at cleaners, Pick up package at Post Office),  whereas still other items can be done in my apartment but require a larger time commitment (i.e. watch a movie that I am teaching in my lecture class and take notes on it.   Prepare notes on story for call with editor tomorrow afternoon).   Other items are more amorphous -- such as brainstorming ideas for a section of a screenplay that isn't working.    And then there are items that won't take much time but that have a built-in resistance to them (i.e. calling back a colleague with whom I have no desire to speak).    When I look at this list, the thought of just scanning it and waiting for an item to jump out at me, just doesn't  work.  I'd much rather say -- "Okay, I'll spend the morning brainstorming ideas for the script, then go out and run these errands, then come back, call the colleague, watch the movie as a reward, etc.<br>That's just what I prefer.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 September 2009 at 14:36 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Steve,<br><br>If you need the structure, then by all means use a system with that structure.  Of course, you could always mix and match.  Put everything into AF as a grass catcher.  Then block time and schedule those things you feel you need to have set up that way.  Work from the schedule first and then work from the AF list when you have discretionary time in your schedule.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2009 at 11:32 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here's a thought...<br><br>At the beginning of the day (or the evening before—whatever works), work through AF as usual, but without actually DOING anything.  Instead of DOING, just SCHEDULE.  <br><br>If Task 1 stands out, then think how much time you want to work on it, and block out that much time on the calendar.<br><br>If Task 2 stands out, do the same.<br><br>If some tasks are "odds and ends" kinds of tasks that take 10 minutes each, then block out an "Odds and Ends" hour (or two), and put those tasks into that bucket.<br><br>Keep going until you are satisfied with your "map" of the day.  Maybe leave some open time for flexibility and to work the list as normal.<br><br>This might give you the structure you need, but still be guided by the rational/intuitive approach of AF.  (And still have AF as a catch-all in box, and still have AF available to be worked as "normal".)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2009 at 19:03 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>These suggestions are incredibly helpful.
