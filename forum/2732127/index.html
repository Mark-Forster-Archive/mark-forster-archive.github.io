I keep the lines short so I can have two columns on that page (if I need them). <br><br>On the right page, I use 4x2. I draw tasks from the left page and, what the heck, anything else I might think of. It's hard for me to include "read novel" or "relax" in a task list, but I've been doing that the last month (I was one of the contractors sidelined by the US government shutdown) and really finding the value in including them.<br><br>The original instructions confused me a bit, because it seemed you could pick from any of the 8 tasks, do one, then any of the 7 tasks, etc. but there was also an emphasis on doing 2 from one column and 2 from the other column. So I instead start with the left column, do any 2, then work from the right column, do any 2, rewrite the left column to have all 4 remaining tasks, and draw four new or recurring tasks from the left page. (If anything recurs, it goes on the left page.)<br><br>I like using 4x2 as a structured way to work through the list. I find though, with interruptions and whatnot, that I rarely go more than 2 or 3 rounds on the right page. That may just be typical of the tasks I'm selecting and my life's interruptions/demands.<br><br>Still early days, though, so no conclusions drawn. But I'm enjoying the process and feeling mostly on top of things though my inboxes are out of control at the moment. (I'm on several committees and there's a lot of activity happening at the moment.)<br><br>And I go back to work tomorrow! So I'll be using the serial no-list and 4x2 in my work notebook there.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2019 at 14:33 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I pick the tasks in any order, not necessarily from the left side first, so long as I don't attempt more than two of the tasks on either side of the page.<br><br>I'm finding this method gets me into a flow-like state quickly and leaves me there for a longer time than any other I have tried.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2019 at 12:26 | David C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm surprised at how much I like this approach.  It has real drawing power to me because I look forward to completing 4 tasks so that I can create a new "block" of 8.  It has  helped me get through those tasks I defer on too often with simple scanning a long list.  I still have a "long list"  and I alternate adding tasks to the 4 X 2 after scanning the  long list or just from my intuition like a "no-list"  but once I have my 8 tasks I stick to them. <br><br>One thing I changed was that I drew a line halfway down a clean page and I do the "left side" list on top and the "right side" list on the bottom under the line.

There are never more than 8 cells occupied.  <br><br>If you use paper,  and strike through tasks that you have done or transferred from right to left, then the left side grows by two rows per cycle, and the right side grows by four, so, yes, the right list would grow twice as fast as the left.<br><br>I think it's important that the two lots of four tasks are next to each other, or nearly so.

I like to close the sets.   It has also reduced my feeling of overwhelm because I see sets instead of pages.   This is especially true as I review previous days pages.

I've broken the rules so many times I'm not always sure what my rules are. :)<br><br>After some contemplation, I think I can say that I've generally changed the original rules as below:<br><br>Rule 1: Old "Rule A"  changes from using two columns to a single column.  Every 4th item, draw a line under it to make it a set of 4.  Stick to one page a day if possible.  For me, this means a maximum of 8 sets of 4 (32 items on a page)<br><br>Rule 2:  Use "Simple Scanning" to scan  all sets on the page  equally for the current day. Do the item that "stands out"   <br><br>As mentioned before, a single remaining item in a set tends to "stand out" which is often a good thing as it relates to procrastination. I have attempted to enforce the original  "Rule B" by doing  2 items from the top set (set 1) and two from the next set (set 2) before moving on to set 3, but have found that this was a rule I violated often because newer items came in that needed immediate attention. <br><br>The magic of for me comes from completing sets and reviewing on the next day anyway. (see Rule 3)<br><br>Rule 3:  When starting a new day, make 2 completely new sets from the previous day's page(s)  by taking 1 unfinished item from a each incomplete set  on the previous pages.<br>  <br>For example, on a single page I find I can create 8 sets, so this means I would "transfer", a maximum of 8 items from previous pages  and populate 2  new sets on the fresh page.  Once items are transferred to the new day's page, mark the item on the old page  as complete. <br><br> This last rule is a work in process for me.  After several days, I have a lot of pages to choose from but ideally, I would keep it to only 8 items transferring. The whole idea of starting a new list each day is to attempt to limit my choices and reduce overwhelm each day.  After I create my first two sets, I add additional items (and sets) as things pop up but my current day's page always starts with two sets of items that are chosen from previous pages based on the algorithm of one per incomplete set.<br><br>Each day I'm forcing myself to evaluate/work on at least 8 items from previous pages while maintaining the freshness of a new list each day.<br><br>Rule 4:  Do what works for you. :)<br><br>Brent</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 March 2019 at 4:54 | Brent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Fascinating!

And so it has, and continues to do, and I am getting enormous amounts of stuff done, which is valuable given that the number 2 in my team has left and I am temporarily doing his job as well as my own.  <br><br>But, I am finding, this all comes at a price, which is a sense of exhaustion and overwhelm.  Is it inevitable that the more effective a system is in raw productivity, the more powerfully it will bring unwanted side effects?
