An inbox can be something you process at once or incrementally, but: Processing is not doing every page therein.  Processing is writing tasks in AF and either discarding the page or putting it in a file for reference when you get to the task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2010 at 21:54 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I should note I don't have an inbox.

I have experienced it a little bit already, but your description helped reinforce that intuition. <br><br>@Alan, I might experiment  a little with processing actions in to AF and filing paperwork. For the extra work thats involved, I like the idea of giving myself a clear space to work from.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 April 2010 at 23:39 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"where does that piece of paper reside until I "autofocus" on it?"<br><br>Erik, you might like to try a system that I have used for some 12 months now of having a special  "paper" tray on my desk.  Like Alan, I like to keep my In-box empty and I find that there is often no natural file for paper related to a task in AF.<br><br>For such papers, I use "letter files" (rather stiff plastic sleeves open on two sides).  Once the task is entered into AF, I slip the paper into the letter file and place it at the bottom of the "paper" tray.  That way, the papers are piled in the tray in exactly the same order as they appear in AF and they are easy to find when they stand out for attention in AF.<br><br>At this present moment, I have eleven such temporary files in my "paper" tray.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 April 2010 at 0:51 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Erik,<br><br>One thing I think is missing from this board is that people tend to jump in and ask questions and never report back on what they decided to do and how it was helpful.<br><br>I often wonder how useful a list of 52 hacks and tweaks from others could possibly help anyone other than fuel the interest and salve the boredom of we productivity nerds.<br><br>This thread remained small and useful and you seem to have gotten something out of it and seem to be a thoughtful inquisitor.

Since they are transparent, you can see at a glance exactly what is in them.<br><br>If you need to, you can pick up the whole pile of files and spread them like a deck of cards to find a required item.  And if your supply comes in assorted colours, it can be even easier to find a particular item since you tend to remember what colour you use for a certain item.  (Mostly I prefer clear plastic files since they are more transparent and they make it easier to see what is inside.)<br><br>Having all your papers in these plastic files makes it very easy to slip new items in at the bottom of the pile so that the items stand in exactly the same order as thy stand in your AF list.  If you care to use this strategy of slipping things in at the bottom, you will find that when your task comes up in AF, the related file is usually at or very near the top of the stack.<br><br>One further thing I find helpful is that when I forget to re-enter an unfinished task in AF, the stray paper rises to the top of the stack and I am reminded to deal appropriately with it.<br><br>Often an AF task will have 3 or 4 different pieces of paper, perhaps of different shapes and sizes, associated with it.  These letter files are ideal for keeping such items together.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2010 at 1:42 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Erik<br><br>My link above does not seem to have worked too well.

Do you try to keep the A1 to A20 files in any numerical order on the stack?

Plastic slips and slides something awful!<br>They get re-arranged every now and then without too much hassle. <br><br>I name them somewhat in the way you describe: task first (which often refers to the paper itself) followed by the folder number in parenthesis. For eg: Review printed spreadsheet (A6).<br><br>No particular reason why its done that way, I suppose I would like my eyes to fall on the task first, rather the document it refers to, for the purposes of allowing it to stand out better. It's amazing how much resistance one can develop to reaching out for the letter files especially when you are in flow and knocking off tasks quickly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2010 at 8:29 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I feel such resistance too though it's more like a lack of interest in working on something. I think it's the lack of clarifying detail I the task that causes this. Such resistence doesn't happen when I have the page embedded in my list. Of course that's only feasible due to my implementation in OneNote.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2010 at 13:08 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Now that's interesting, Alan.  I have exactly the opposite experience.  I have teased out some of my projects in OneNote (largely as a result of Christine B's encouragement about the strengths of OneNote) but I have found that recently all of the projects I had been developing in OneNote have "slipped off" my AF list because they got too detailed and "formidable".<br><br>By contrast, the tasks that are represented by "bits of paper" that have arrived in my Inbox and that I have parked in letter files on my desk seem to be the ones that usually "feel ready" to be done because they are near at hand and usually less complex. <br><br>I guess that it really depends on how comfortable one is with the technology of various methods.  I am more comfortable with the Lo Tech methods but that's just me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2010 at 14:23 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jim, yours is quite a different scenario.  My OneNote pages are actually my AF list.  If a page slips off then the project is gone.  A task doesn't refer to a separate project page.  When I look at a task, I am actually looking at the embedded project page.  So I can work on it, ignore it, or maybe just tease out what I'm supposed to do next and write that detail in.  I think it's a matter of immediacy that it's working for my setup but not for yours.  In your setup paper is more immediately available.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2010 at 16:56 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
