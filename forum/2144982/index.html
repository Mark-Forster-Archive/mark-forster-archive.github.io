Mccormack (+Rip). He helped me so much in my business career. <br>I just discovered he wrote a book about organization and efficiency. I found it only in English and bought it immediately on amazon. I just began the reading. Happily it it is not too complicated for a non native English speaker. <br><br>Has any body red his book ? What do you think about it ?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 June 2013 at 15:09 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've owned Time Management for Dummies for years and it's still my favorite productivity book. Mark McCormack foreshadowed so much of what is considered new and ground breaking: embracing the simplicity of low-tech/analog, using one capture tool, contexts, time blocking, closed lists, etc.  It's a fantastic book; you'll love it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 June 2013 at 4:50 | JeffVC</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oops, you'd think a guy would know the title of a book he just got all gushy about: GETTING RESULTS for Dummies,  not Time Management!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 June 2013 at 4:53 | JeffVC</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just to tell you that I have already finished "Getting results for dummies" from Mark H Mccormack. Its is an amazing book. It is perfect for business makers and I am so sorry that I did not read it about 20 years ago it would have helped me very much.<br><br>It gives many tricks. It works very well with some MF methods. But the red guidline is time. <br>Like many great ideas it is so simple that I wonder why I never thought about this. <br>I would summarize it in 3 parts <br>1. Collect all in one place.<br>2. Make objectives list for day, week, month, years, 2 years, 5 years <br>3. Day by day follow your time and tasks and work by priority which will change, because everything change. So adapt yourself. <br>Nothing is revolutionary. We find many things coming from covey, MF, David allen, and many others. But it method has a great effect on productivity even if I don't follow some of his own method but has he said himself i do it like this but it doesnt mean it will work for you. So I dont use a paper note pad but a spiral note book. I use what I like working on. I dont also use what he used ie dividing a page by 2  and reporting people you want to call on the left and what you want to do on the right. I use a simple list were are reported the time and what I do. For the rest I use another list my daily plan list and a weekly list and a next week list. Anyway, with this method there are no backlog but it takes a little time of thinking about what you really want to do the next day, affect a priority and what is most important a duration. It just need paper and pen and that s all.  "Getting results for dummies" from Mark H Mccormack, is a must read. Yes indeed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2013 at 15:45 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One add<br>Finally I realize that dont really change the work I work since 30 years. <br>1. I still use a spiral A4 notebook a pen and paper<br>2. I Plan my next day I night before ending my job<br>3. I use list like MF AF list <br>4. I spend some time working on projects and finding solution. <br><br>The only thing which really change is <br>1. I collect all my tasks on a spiral carnet 5X5 that I have always with me. I drop there my ideas, tasks and everything which happen during the day.  I used to do it but a few years ago I dropped this in my spiral A4 note book this was a mistake. <br>2. I Use my spiral A4 note book for collecting incoming information about buildings or rewards. These will be treated later on another format and for collecting what I did (tasks and projects) <br>ie WF - Doc about project x. I did it but it was in an AF1 list. So it was difficult to extract from my burden I mad the MIT. <br>3. What really changed is fixing priorities by day, week, quarter, year, 2  and 5 years. I never did it. This was a cruel disaster for me. I changed<br>4. Most of my doc are on paper. I tried to do it on my computer but it was unproductive and in efficient. Computer is for references (GTD sense) and some communication<br><br>Following Mc Cormack method is not complicated. But the most important is to stick on his method and not to give it up. Good new it is much easier than working with GTD. It is operational immediately.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2013 at 16:15 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello all<br>I am finished mac cormack book getting tesultas for dummies i began june 19 <br>After 2 monthes of test i admit that the method suits well for me and for business maker<br>It iseasy to combine it with gtd and it is very easy to make it works<br>The book is quiet thick and there are some very good advices.
