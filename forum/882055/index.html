Because you won't find "brief" here. I went a little crazy last night (happens alarmingly often lately) and create the most elaborate documentation of Mark's AF4 demonstration ever (524 pages, 3,4 mb). It shows every single step. And I mean really, really low level. It basically shows how Mark's eyes moved during using the list - or at least should move according to the rules. ;-)<br><br>I'm not sure if it's gonna be of use for anyone, but you can take a look at it: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/af4-demo.pdf">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/af4-demo.pdf</a><br><br>Perhaps some people will understand the rules better if they are spelled out so graphically. Perhaps I just wasted some time, but I feel good about it. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 September 2009 at 9:33 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just noticed I dropped the task "Name of Firefox Extension" early on.

As others have said it is excellent to see how the list changes and grows over time, and the level at which Mark is working.<br><br>When you have 5 minutes...I'd certainly love to understand how you created it. I'd imagine that you used the firefox extensions to show all the changes, and then laid out one page in ?Word?, and copied on each time? It's the type of thing that it's always interesting to see how someone does (in less time than it would tkae me).<br><br>Jonathan</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 September 2009 at 16:01 | Jonathan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jonathan,<br><br>I used SiteDelta in the beginning, but realized that it was not good enough, because it only really saved a backup copy when you manually viewed the changes. So I wrote a small script that saved the backups for me. The creation process was pretty much like you described it. I used OpenOffice Writer instead of Word, but a lot of copying&amp;pasting was involved. Its really great when you realize you made a mistake 20 pages ago and you must change them all. ^^</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 September 2009 at 16:20 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great.

That was certainly very instructive for me. Not just regarding AF4, but also on how Mark works his AF list with repeated tasks.<br><br>Analysing his "Email" task that was in column 3 at the start of the day, just after where he left off the day before - p 5 of 526<br><br>I see Mark passes "Email" multiple times as he cycles through the Active List and Backlog; sometimes doing (D), doing &amp; immediately readding (DR), skipping (S) or just adding (A) - pp 16(DR), 36(S), 170(D), 196(A "Check Site Visitors"), 224(D), 306(A "Wash Up"), 501(DR), 522(D) ... ("Email" was readded before end of the day)<br><br>I can imagine Mark doing &amp; immediately readding if he didn't manage to clear his inbox to zero. And when he managed to get his inbox to zero he didn't immediately readd the "Email" task.<br><br>However, I'm wondering what criteria/stimulus makes him add "Email" tasks, when he don't have it on his list.

I could FEEL how it worked from the demo (which only took a couple of minutes to go through.  I think this should be included with the instructions Mark, for visual learners like most of us.<br>Oh, and I wouldn't play up the 500+ pages element - that almost made me not open it...although I was curious.  It's so intuitive to work through the PDF.<br>One more thing: my day with AF4 today was the closest I've been to 'flow' for a very long time.  I think AF4 captures the strengths of AF1, while allowing you to get to the end quickly when you need to (before thrusting you into the 'harder' bits again).<br>Andreas, thank you.<br>Mark, you're brilliant.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 10:51 | Ben</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas:<br><br>Having taken two days off from AF, I've only just got round to looking at your pdf.

What I didn't get was : was page 316 blank for some reason? And why are all items even if not re-entered counted as actioned?  It seems to me that some items don't get re-entered, not because you don't want to do them but because you realise you cannot do them in the near future. Surely you would want to possible review them later - kind of SDMB?<br><br>If you would normally take days going through the lists. The closed list could be weeks old if you are only picking off the odd thing? And the active list in this time could be growing (I find about 1/2 of my AF items get done on the first pass and others get picked off over time). But your working the open list from the oldest item. So today I added:<br>laundry<br>empty bins <br>clean bedroom<br>clean bathroom<br>check car oil (this one is urgent)<br><br>But these items will be done last on the list, or am I misunderstanding? Its hard to skip to them as they are so close at the end that I would then have done a pass and then be forced to go back to the close list.<br><br>Is my closed list weird? My closed list is either big jobs or items I am dragging my heels on. I know I _should_ do them, I kind of need to do them. But who has a task list only of items they want to do. Life is not that way. When I read the PDF it made me not want to use my current list on it.

The reason they are deleted with a highlighter rather than the normal pen-stroke is so that on the next pass you can decide what to do with the deleted tasks (discard, re-enter, etc.)<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 21:25 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark--thanks for this.

You can just follow the rules and still "jump" straight to an urgent task that just landed on your lap.  The only times this wouldn't work are <br><br>(1) ... when you are in the process of dealing with highlighted items.  If you just abandon them, then the rules dictate that they are deleted.  In this case you could just "suspend" the rules till next time around.<br><br>and<br><br>(2) ... if you are on a pass through your Closed List / Backlog and haven't yet taken action on anything.  You would end up highlighting the whole lot if you jump to your Open List right then.  Of course you could suspend the rules in this case, too, or you could just take a quick action on one task, and then jump to your new task, and you'd be following all the rules.<br><br>At least, that's how it seems to me.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 21:37 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Beth, what you are missing is that in AF4 those highlighted tasks are NEVER done.  When you come back to them on the next pass you either delete them entirely or copy them to the end of the open list.  THEN, perhaps (hopefully?) they will get done.

I put a dot (.) on the left margin of the item I am currently working on. <br>3. I put an "x" on the left margin of an item that I decide I no longer want to do (call this "cancelled).<br>4. I put a vertical line on the left margin of an item that I have completed.<br>5. I put a horizontal line (-) on the left margin of the backlog items marked for dismissal. On the next (and final) pass through the backlog, I bisect that horizontal line with a vertical line (and, possibly, re-add the item at the bottom of the list).<br><br>A completed page will have a continuous vertical line down the left hand margin, with the exception of the x's in front of the canceled items.<br><br>I have had a lot of discretionary time during these first two days of AF4.
