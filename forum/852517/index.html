My question is this, I work from home and basically have no set hours. My goal is to boost the overall time that I spend working. Anyone have any tips on this?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 August 2009 at 17:10 | Bob Roberts</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Bob<br>Timeboxing is perfect for this!  Be sure to log your time working as well.  Sometimes I'll top-load my work at the beginning of the day and also at the beginning of the week to assure myself that the most important stuff doesn't drag into the last hours or days.  It becomes a game/challenge.  A by-product is a free mind which invites creativity and enjoyment of leisure time without the drag of dread or guilt.  Also timeboxing helps me to LIMIT my work as well.  I also close shop sharply at 5 unless I chose to split the workday for other reasons.  I don't like mixing leisure time and work time, although many people here are quite happy to do so.  That you'll need to decide for yourself.<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 August 2009 at 18:20 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Bob, nice timing with your question:<br><br>I got a tip from another reader - check out my post on AF (any version) and setting limits. what is working well for me at the moment is writing 'start af' and then 'stop af' directly underneath it. I write in the start time and then cross the task out. When 'stop af' stands out I log the time in and then cross 'stop af' out. <br><br>Although this does not log the time spent on individual tasks, it does provide feedback about the duration of time spent doing quality work (similar in some ways to the Now Habit). In any case I'd prefer not to time individual tasks because I think this works against the main benefit of AF, that is working for as long as you feel like.<br><br> I like this concept because it helps me switch on and off mentally also - so I can enjoy time when I'm not working from AF. <br><br>I'll probably tally up the amount of quality hours I put in during a week and set some sort of reward system up and an upper weekly time target (again using ideas from the Now Habit).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 August 2009 at 21:54 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great idea Leon</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 5:08 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"writing 'start af' and then 'stop af' directly underneath it.

As well, I may be doing AF from 10AM - 11:30AM, bike ride to a coffee joint, and then do AF for another 45 min, etc. So I'm going to take your idea, and add this hack:<br><br>""writing 'start af' and then 'stop af' directly underneath it. I start the stopwatch on my iphone, and then then cross the task out. When 'stop af' stands out I pause the stopwatch. Rinse and repeat for the rest of the day. At the end of the day, I should have a decent estimate of how much time I spent in AF mode. <br><br>Thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 5:16 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"does provide feedback about the duration of time spent doing quality work"<br><br>Like Mark, when I'm working AF, I put my "quality" and "time wasting" stuff onto my lists. So I won't be measuring "quality work" per se, but rather, how much time per day was I engaged in mindful activities i.e. working in AF mode... regardless of activity.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 5:44 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Avrum, The stopwatch idea seems fine. It's easier than logging up times at the end day - which is what I do. On the other hand,  I personally get a benefit in observing *patterns* of sessions that I do daily. For example, I have been doing around 3 AF sessions daily, on average. These vary in duration, but a general pattern is beginning to emerge. I find this useful because I have previously lost my structure to the day somewhat when using AF.<br><br>I  am including my "time wasting" stuff within the time and treating these activities as a break when I need one. Seems to be working OK. Routine activities like running etc get scheduled, otherwise I will not do them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 8:05 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon &amp; Avrum: Very nice suggestions indeed, thanks! A question to Leon: does this mean that you don't put things like "Veg out in front of TV" as a task, since you are measuring time doing only quality work? <br><br>Like you, I've got a couple of young boys overflowing with energy and I work a lot from home. So, sometimes there is task like "Tame hissy fit" scribbled in haste before I leave my workstation to prevent the start of World War III. It does feel less like an interruption and more like dealing with life as it unfolds.<br><br>But it doesn't work all the time. There are times when I am writing in too many tasks that are more like a distraction than productive work. But at least there is a realisation that this is happening.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 8:19 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon: Our posts crossed. I see that you are indeed writing in less productive work as well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 8:25 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi JD, what I am basically doing is 'stopping AF' if my break is for more than five - ten minutes maximum. So a lunch break or spending time with my sons would certainly be counted as 'stopping AF'. When I'm ready to get going again I will log in my start time. This is helping me to connect and disconnect from AF more effectively and focus on enjoying time with my children rather than worrying about all the things I have to do:) As mentioned above, the other benefit is having a time target to aim for each week, or to at least record and interpret this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 8:41 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Leon.

Could you explain? I generally don't write tasks down that I am doing, or about to do -- unless it will remain unfinished and I'll need to return to it later, but even then I would tend to wait until I return from the unfinished task to right it down (you never know, I might finish it and so not have to write it down).<br><br>Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what is actually going on in the example you give?<br><br>Thanks!<br>--Joseph</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 13:32 | Joseph</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum, just a thought if you wanted to keep track of both the total amount of time spent in the day, as well as each of the time segments (if you had wanted to see your "patterns" over time). There's an iPhone program called Daily Tracker which has a timer feature (keeps going even if you go to another program) and will show the total time, with the "sub-times" automatically segmented out  if you want to see them, with the time of day they had been added. (It's not the easiest feature to find at first, but just tap on the bottom right button in "Day" view. Underneath the timer where you can start and stop the timer is also a handy "Notes" section and you can also email yourself all your times/notes.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 14:13 | Bev</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh Bev, you've whet my geek appetite.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 15:01 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Joseph: I write just about everything I'm about to do down at the end of the list. eg: (a) PC is  booted up, there are a few sites I want to go to check out news, I write it down and cross it off once done. (b) i'm in a middle of a task, and a call comes in requiring me to do something right away, I cross off what I was doing, re-enter it at the end, and also write down what I am about to do regarding the call.<br><br>Just gives me a sense of control. And when I am procrastinating, writing down those mindless tasks I am doing raises my awareness that they are not productive, and helps me ease myself into the more important tasks, once that bout is out of my system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 August 2009 at 16:25 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh gosh.
