Basically it sits on a number of computers (and your iPhone if you use one) and syncs the designated folders on each computer to a website.  When you log onto each computer it automatically updates to the website.  If you are at a completely different computer (or a public one) you can access files from the website.  If you have an iPhone you can see them there.  It is pretty spiffy.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2010 at 21:54 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I heart dropbox. I use it much the way you plan to Roger and it has made life much easier.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2010 at 21:59 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh, and if you use this link:<br><br>https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI1MTk0MDU5<br><br>to get your free account, I'll get an extra 250MB of storage space.  They have a nice referral program.  (I'd not recommend it if I did not use it.)<br><br>Ah, one more thing.  I have my dropbox set to MyDocuments, which is the default and seemed easiest.  I'm working on a OneNote document now and it saves every few seconds.  So DropBox is backing up the file all the time.  I'm not so sure I want that much of a hit on my processing.  I'm not really noticing it but ...<br><br>So maybe I'll have OneNote save elsewhere and use something like SyncToy to sync that folder to MyDocuments.  Or maybe I'll just accept the hit so that it happens automatically and I won't forget.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2010 at 22:01 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I just recently switched from Dropbox to Live Mesh from Microsoft.  My primary reasons were:<br><br>- Live Mesh gives 5GB cloud storage, to Dropbox's 2GB<br>- Live Mesh has a remote desktop feature<br>- Live Mesh can sync folders/files between 2 computers only, skipping the cloud (handy to keep your 16GB music collection synced between 2 computers w/o consuming your 5GB web storage)<br><br>So I sync my documents between 2 PCs and the cloud, but my MP3s only between the 2 computers.<br><br>However, Live Mesh does not do file versioning like Dropbox does, so once you make a change to a file and it syncs to the cloud, that's the only version you have.  I have other backup solutions in place to mitigate this risk, though.<br><br>Just an alternative to consider.  Dropbox is a great service that I happily used until I decided my music collection must follow me wherever I go.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2010 at 22:03 | Brian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Also, I doubt either service would handle Outlook PSTs gracefully.  Never tried it though.  OneNote works well over cloud syncing as long as you're not editing your Notebooks simultaneously on 2 PCs.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2010 at 22:05 | Brian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Brian,<br><br>Thanks for that input.  I'll have to give that a try.  And yes, I forgot to mention the versions.  That is very handy in case you screw up.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2010 at 22:07 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks everyone, quick responses!<br><br>Not sure about Live Mesh, except maybe for music as Brian does.<br><br>Mike: why should I not just use SyncToy if I'm only using two "local" computers?  I do realise DropBox has other advantages for file sharing.<br><br>If I exceed 2 Gb with DropBox, I will end up paying a monthly charge which after about 7 months would be more expensive than ViceVersa, another utility.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2010 at 22:42 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Roger,<br><br>That may be the best way for you.  The advantage to DropBox is that it is automatic.  Your computers remain in sync so long as they are connected to the Internet.  Also that you can get to the files from any computer that has access to the Internet.<br><br>As to the capacity, yes, SyncToy has no limit.  I think DropBox is better for syncing individual files in a designated directory than the whole machine.  That is why I am syncing "My Documents".  Most programs save there by default (and I check to have them do that).  So all of my word processing and spreadsheet files are synced.  I'm using a small fraction of my capacity now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2010 at 0:45 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The following dropbox help entry could be interesting for you:  <br><br>What is LAN sync? <br>LAN sync is a Dropbox feature that speeds syncing dramatically when the file exists on your Local Area Network (LAN).<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dropbox.com/help/137">http://www.dropbox.com/help/137</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2010 at 6:12 | kneitinga</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Mike, and kneitingafor that LAN hint.<br><br>This thread has given me impetus to restructure my folder tree structure (note to self: write it down in DWM, New Entry, Today + 28!).<br><br>I've always stayed clear of My Documents, preferring to have a "DATA" folder to make quick copying onto my external HDD (but I use Acronis True Image for security backup images).  I think initially I will separate DATA into DATA ARCHIVE (stuff up to and including 2008) and DATA CURRENT, the latter to include this year, last year and ongoing folders like my accounting, personal stuff etc.<br><br>I also need to rationalise Outlook in a big way, it's getting too big, again.<br><br>I think I'll try out DropBox, I like the fact that there is an online copy, just wary when my Internet access is flaky, which it sometimes is at some of my assignment locations.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2010 at 7:42 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Roger,<br><br>Yes, weak Internet access could be a problem.  OTOH, all you need to is walk into a coffee shop these days, open up your laptop, and zing, you are up to date.  It will sync when it can.<br><br>Folders:  Yes, I used to think My Documents was a pain.  Then I realized that it would be just as easy to reorganize that to make it useful.  I have subfolders under it sorting things out nicely.  But whatever works.  Oh, and if I did not make it clear, you don't HAVE to use My Documents.  You get to specify a folder.  I just use it because it is simpler.  Most Windows programs default to saving there so it is less to remember to move around later.  I started out using a folder on my desktop that I dragged stuff into.  Then it seemed easier to just let things go where Windows wants to put them and be happy with that.<br><br>Now I love Big Brother.  LOL ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2010 at 10:48 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike,<br><br>Thanks, but in my travels to and from A to Z - Afghanistan to Zambia - I've come across some really flaky connections.  Even the "new" mobile broadband service in Zambia last year was unable to facilitate Internet banking, not a zing in sight ;-}<br><br>I've been thinking about your My Documents suggestion a bit more, and the changed structure can be nested under My Documents.  <br><br>The exercise has been worthwhile, my archives are being relocated to my external HDD, plus a few DVDs of the same data to be kept at another address, just in case.  Years ago there was an advertising campaign run by one of the magnetic media producers (disks, tapes etc).  The message was, "There are two kinds of data: that which is on your hard disk and that which has been backed up, there is no other in-between alternative."<br><br>Now back to restructuring my folders . . . .</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2010 at 20:45 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A question to the Dropbox users: Do multiple versions (revisions) of a file count (add up) against your storage limit or does a file only count once? <br>I couldn't find that out from their website. <br><br>I've also been interested in Dropbox for a while.<br><br>However, if multiple revisions of a file add up against the storage quota, I would exceed the 2 GB limit fairly quickly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 March 2010 at 20:49 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I guess it would be the total size of all your files, old, new and revised, at any one time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 March 2010 at 22:31 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hmm... any comments from actual Dropbox users? <br><br>BTW, I just found a post with the information that Dropbox will now only keep 30 days of revision history, unless you pay. <br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.allyourspace.com/dropbox-undo-history-iphone-app-and-lan-sync/">http://www.allyourspace.com/dropbox-undo-history-iphone-app-and-lan-sync/</a><br><br>Really liked this piece of marketing speak: The change is said to have been made because "[f]or many people this [i.e., unlimited undo history] creates clutter, and it also wastes space". And not, becauses it costs the Dropbox guys server space and not to force people to upgrade to a paid account, of course :-) <br><br>OTOH, the "wastes space" remark seems to indicate that past versions do indeed count against the account limit. <br><br>The post I quoted above includes another information that might be useful for RogerJ's use case: a new LAN Sync feature that "knows when Dropboxes are on the same network and will automatically exchange files directly between computers instead of downloading them from our servers". To me that sounds interesting if you have a unreliable internet connection.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 March 2010 at 23:39 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Alex W,<br><br>"knows when Dropboxes are on the same network"  I assume that one has one login ID, password etc and the Dropbox application sees the Dropbox folder on each computer.<br><br>Does that mean Dropbox uses mac addresses or similar?<br><br>Anyone tried just synchronising with a USB cable, BlueTooth or wifi?   That may be better for me ie independent of the Internet, maybe with SynchToy or similar?
