Or in a lever-arch file with A-Z tabs.  I have a feeling I may want to organise them into a logical order at some point so they are easy to put my hands on.<br><br>I am a paper and pen girl so electronic is no good for me.

A brief survey:<br><br>- One "semi-electronic" method which might suit even though you specified no electronic is to put your lists in a electronic format then print them to put in some kind of book, either glued onto a page or cover (with a glue stick, for example), or punched or clipped, etc.  If you go this route ANY electronic product will work.  Pages in a Word document for example, or even a "note" document will do fine.  Some people use Excel for the ease of entering things in column format and putting dates and check boxes and such.<br><br>- I keep my AF list in a bound book right now (long story ;-)  I use one of those "composition books" that kids use for school.  You know, the marbled covered ones?  I got them at the beginning of the school year sale for $0.25 each and picked up dozens.  They normally can be found at a big box store for $1 each or so, in sets of 5 or so.  They have about 200 pages (100 sheets) and are hard backed so are easy to write in anywhere.  For the few special lists I keep on paper I just work from the back of the book forward.  It is not that confusing to find things, really.  If need be, I could use some kind of flag to help ... but I don't find it necessary.  I keep only a few lists, such as grocery lists, errands, things to talk with my wife about, books to read, projects, etc.  For lists I want there and to carry forward from book to book, I glue them onto the back cover.  I made a pocket for 3x5 cards on the front cover to hold a supply of blank cards and a thin plastic ruler (see below)<br><br>- Now that last is not actually true for what I am doing NOW.  I used to do it that way until I got hooked on the Rolabind (also called Circa) system so I have my projects in one of those as well as my calendar and schedule.  (But the AF list is still in the Composition Book.<br><br>- As for grocery lists, and that kind of transient thing, I use 3x5 cards I keep in a plastic holder in my shirt pocket.  (I started wearing shirts with pockets JUST for that purpose.  ;-)  It was getting too complicated to write and find that kind of immediate thing in a book.  I use colored cards to make it faster to get to the right one.  My errands are on green, my wife is blue, habits I'm working on is red, I use white for misc. notes.)<br><br>- One has to give passing notice to the Moleskine crowd ;-)  There is just no ignoring them ;-)<br><br>- I now also have an iPhone and so some of my things wind up there.  For a while I tried my AF list there (ListOmni) but that just was no fun trying to type things in on that small soft keyboard.  I do keep my ticklers there because it alarms me and that is useful.  Of course, my contact list is there ... there is absolutely no point having a list of phone numbers anywhere else but on the phone you use!  LOL ;-)<br><br>When I said "long story" above, I was referring to my previous system of keeping two small spiral books in my pocket with a half-sized pen in the wires.  A vertical 3x5 format served as my AF list and a 4x6 format as a journal for writing notes and such.  (You can get 3x5 spiral notebooks in packs of 10 for about $5 or so at Sam's club, IIRC.)  Mark cajoled me into using the larger format when I was griping about the problems I was having with "Autofocus".  He suggested that I try it as he described it so, I went to the composition book to get 25 lines per page (rather than the 15 I was getting).  It has worked well enough for me to stay with it for now.<br><br>In times past I have used just about every other combination of paper and electronic but those are the big ones (and most current for me ;-)<br><br>One other thought ... if I were to start from scratch today, I might just use TWO compostion books.  One for the AF list and the other for my other lists, projects, planning, etc.  I find that an industrial size rubber band works well to hold a couple of notebooks together.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 21:26 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>OK I've started my AF list on an A4 bound book - an A4 Moleskine lookalike from Asda with the most terrific paper for using with my fountain pens. I figure as I work mostly from home I don't need to carry it around much and it gives me plenty of room on each page.<br><br>I was really just interested in the other types of lists and checklists that I am buildling up to make life easier!<br><br>I'd love to use the circa book, but we can't get it here in the UK. These seem great as you can move stuff around and coral like things together.  I believe you can even get a hole punch so you can print out lists and punch them and file.<br><br>As a capture notebook I have some Field Notes books which are great for pockets and handbags!  I get them from here <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thepaperie.co.uk/">http://www.thepaperie.co.uk/</a><br><br>Thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 22:33 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Welcome,<br><br>I use a medium sized wire notebook for work for lists of tasks and a legal pad for notetaking in case the notes need to go into a file.<br><br>For personal I use a medium size two subject notebook.  The front section is an AF style task list and the second section is notes and lists like I believe you are thinking of, books to read, recurring maintenance at my house etc.  I like this style book because pages can tear out for short life lists like grocery shopping, saturday errands and gift buying without taking the whole thing with me to the store.<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 23:54 | Gerry</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
