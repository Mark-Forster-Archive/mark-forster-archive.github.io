For 2 days this week, I got very little done b/c on the days I "cheated", I did NOT turn to my "master" list, even though I wrote at the bottom of my daily page "see AF list".  Today I went back to the original concept and accomplished 10 times more than I did the previous 2 days.  <br><br>For me, AF works in its (mostly) purest form.  I have tried and failed to implement so many "systems" that I think I am just so used to changing to something new, and I created a problem where none really existed. <br> <br>While I can certainly empathize with those concerned about date- or time-driven tasks, many of my tasks recur weekly.  I just add these to my last page and work from it before going on to any other incomplete pages.  Each day, I write today's date on the first blank line with a box around it, then immediately list the recurring tasks I must do today below it.  I also use my calendar more than ever to make notes about date-driven tasks, which I also check every day and add appropriate tasks below the weekly recurring for the day.<br><br>Of course, we are all unique, and I certainly know, from my experience in trying to implement systems that, to me, seemed to work for everyone else, there is no one-size-fits all in planning &amp; organizing systems.  AF just seems to work with the ADD in me.  Believe it or not, I would find myself placing little post-its around my work area with "instructions" on how to use the flavor-of-the-day system, because there seemed to be so many steps or little nuances that I had to remember.  <br><br>So thank you, Mark, for AutoFocus, because the system allows me to focus on the task at hand while feeling that I have a good handle on ALL of the things I have going on in my life.  I feel so much more calm having ONE place to turn to, and I feel more comfortable with the "analog" part of it, rather than forcing myself into electronic systems that made me crazy half the time.  The concept is surprisingly simple yet it works, for me.  And I (would like to) promise I will never "tweak" again :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2009 at 5:27 | Terri H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oops!

What I actually do is have the recurrences scheduled in Outlook. When the reminder pops up in Outlook, I enter it in AF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 April 2009 at 17:44 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I just wanted to report that I continued adding my recurring tasks for the last 3 days and I was able to complete those tasks as well as a few others from my list, which really gives me a feeling of accomplishment !  I have used highlighting for a long time as a method for crossing off completed tasks ( if memory serves, I think it was the book by Jeff Meyer that got me started on this), and my eyes are "trained" to ignore the highlights when searching for incomplete actions.  It really excited me to take a "big picture" look over my pages yesterday and see all those wonderful yellow bars of completed tasks!<br><br>I just have to prod myself to check my monthly calendar every day!  Not having very many true appointments has made me lazy in building this check into my routine, so I am still somewhat anxious about forgetting something.  I'm going to have to create a visual reminder to make this happen until it becomes a habit, I guess.  Maybe your idea, Moises, of an electronic reminder is the answer...<br><br>In my humble opinion, I think any new system requires the user to develop new habits, and that is why I've probably failed to make previous systems work.  It takes effort to make a new action a habit, and my tendency was to become impatient when new systems didn't magically "cure" the act of getting things done,   Maybe I'm becoming older and wiser, but I think I have become so tired of re-inventing the wheel, that I just decided I was going to make an all-out effort to see if AF would work for me.  My "Aha!" moment was realizing that I have to work it (by creating new habits) in order for it (and any other system) to work.<br><br>I began using AF on 3/17 and while it is not the longest time I have ever used a "new-and-improved" system, this IS the most comfortable I have felt with one.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2009 at 15:29 | Terri H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Terri<br><br>I had gotten out of the habit of checking my calendar regularly, relying on my memory - not always a good move!  I now have a recurring task in AF to "check schedule" whih works well for me.<br><br>Your highlighting of completed items sounds as though it works well - although I just tick my items I use a yellow highlight on my Digital version with a green highlight for dismissed tasks.<br><br>Good luck!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2009 at 16:36 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
