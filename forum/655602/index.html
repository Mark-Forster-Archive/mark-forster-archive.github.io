A number of people have expressed a negative reaction to the term "dismissal".  From what you say above it seems that the issue is not with the action, but with the connotation surrounding the word "dismissal".  In fact, what you call it does not change the action - how you treat it does not change the action, but the way in which you view that action, your perception as it were, completely changes your feelings and emotions towards that action.<br><br>It seems to me that the resistance to this "word" is actually touching on something deeper for all of us.  Yes we can rephrase it to make it more comfortable but is that what AF is encouraging us to do, or is it encouraging us to look at the reasons for our reaction?<br><br>Jay, I think you have identified a very valid point when you say "I feel the term "deliberate" I feel may have a more subconscious acceptance in my own mind" and I think you have then gone on to examine why and what those words mean to you.  The action however is the same, as you point out.  I wonder though, having actually examined the reason for the reaction to the word dismissal, whether you do actually now feel the need to change it to something, or whether the recognition itself is sufficient?<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2009 at 22:39 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good point Christine<br>I guess my personal connotations for the term "dismissing" were what caused resistance to highlighting items even when I knew I wasn't going to work on them in the immediate future.(They went on my list in the first place because I thought they were important enough to do at some point)<br>It is only more recently though I have understood that "Dismissal" in AF terms isn't actually a final elimination of items.<br>Hence my suggestion for the term "for deliberation" which is perhaps less misunderstood at least in common usage of the terms.<br>Just my opinion,but mentally "for deliberation" seems to induce less resistance for me than "dismissed".It means the item is still important to me,but that I have consciously chosen not to act on it for now.<br>Jay</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2009 at 23:04 | Jay</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've struggled myself with the concept of dismissal, not because I didn't think I could'nt reinstate the items at some point but because to me the concept of dismissing them was somehow linked to failure.  "I put them on my list, therefore they were important, therefore if I don't do them I am a failure."  Interesting huh?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2009 at 23:53 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting discussion.  I have been using my personal and business AF lists as my "dashboard", populating them with items that come from my warehouse of project lists.  Some items on the project lists won't get done for months or years.  They reason they go on the AF list is my sense that they want to be done "now".<br><br>Then, following the system, if on the 10th or 20th go-round I have a last item or two that doesn't seem to "stand out", for me the questions are:<br><br>Was I wrong that, given my workload, they can realistically happen "now"?  Dismissed! (or "deferred" or "annulled")<br><br>Do they need some special context in time or space that for whatever reason isn't happening?  Move to the calender, move to my "agenda" list.<br><br>Am I bouncing off the task because it is hard for me to do emotionally or I can't get my mind around how to approach it?  Here I find the AF approach most valuable, and the suggestions of the people from this forum.  I need to break it down and make a small start, or power through, or (here I do feel that I've failed) dismiss it as something I'm not up to right now, although it "should" be done "now".<br><br>AF is helping me to see my own working (and not-workings).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 1:17 | Tom</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting thread.  How about thinking of "dismissed" as in the old-fashioned expression that teachers used - "Class dismissed"?  It doesn't mean that the teacher is getting rid of the class because he/she is a failure; or getting rid of them because he/she never wants to see them again; or getting rid of them because he/she's lazy and can't be bothered teaching them any more that day.  It means that the time is not right to go on teaching them because he/she has other classes to fit in, or it's dinner-time, or the classroom has caught fire and at that moment leaving the classroom is a higher priority than conjugating Latin verbs.   Same goes for dismissing items on the AF list.  Just a thought.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 9:50 | Margaret-1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>After all the discussion about the term "dismissed" I still feel that it is the right term to use. I wanted a word which had a somewhat peremptory sound about it, as in "If you don't do this, you're dismissed". It was intended to denote the moment of truth, when the choice stops being "Do I do Task A or Task B?" and becomes "Do I do Task A at all?"<br><br>It's very important to realise that dismissal is essential to the whole AF process, and permeates the whole process even when no tasks are in immediate danger of being dismissed. The knowledge that in the end a task will get dismissed if it isn't done actually reduces resistance - there's nothing you *have* to do in AF. But it also means that at some stage you really do have to make a final choice about tasks. If there were no dismissal in AF you wouldn't be able to throw things in it without pre-evaluation.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 11:57 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark<br><br>Your reply really confirms what i was instinctively feeling about the term "dismissal".  I may not like it, it may throw up other things, but I feel I "need" it to complete the AF process.  Another word would somehow water down the process. <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 12:42 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hmmm.... perhaps "shot at dawn" would be even better?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 12:52 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't think so - That would be adding another rule "Get Up Before Sunrise"  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2009 at 14:04 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Back in Blighty with a decent Internet connection, trying to catch up with the ebb and flow on this forum, much food for thought.<br><br>FWIT, I've tagged "dismissal" items as "Dismissed for Review" (in my first manual and current ListPro configuration), so I guess I've always regarded them as not dismissed forever.

It does not seem to fit somehow.  I think "deferred" might be better and I really liked the GtD idea of "someday/maybe".  That completely captures the idea for me.  "This is something I will "maybe" do "someday", but for now, I need to get it out of my way.  I don't need to give up on it, but until I'm willing to work on it, it needs to go back and sit in the corner."  ;-)  I don't like "dismissal" precisely because of its finality.  I was having trouble with lots of things hanging around on lists because I was not "ready" to do them but I refused to give up on them.  "Dismissing" them brings up that same old problem that "someday/maybe" solved.  Hence, I call it "someday/maybe".<br><br>In practice, it is no different.  My "big" items come from my projects list and when I drop one from my AF list I know it remains a project elsewhere.

(Not that it really matters since AF has been released now anyway).  <br><br>Nonetheless for me, "dismissed" means exactly that.  Dead and gone.  Not done and no longer on my list.  I figure I've had 10-15 goes at giving this a chance to stand out to do what could amount to no more than 2 minutes work (see my post here <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/659821">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/659821</a> ).  If I couldn't be bothered to do that - then it no longer deserves a place on my list.<br><br>One of the key features for me of AF is this ability to Auto-eliminate tasks.  As Mark and many others have said, a clear vision is often more about what you are not going to do.  For me, eliminating something I probably was never going to do is actually quite liberating - almost a sense of accomplishment in itself.  I don't even highlight them anymore - I actually mark them as done and close the page.<br><br>With DIT you had to carry them over, and then re-examine your commitments (can be hard) and then possibly declare a backlog.  With AF the process is just automatic.<br><br>As you can tell - I'm a fan.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2009 at 22:55 | Simon C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have to say I support the use of the word dismissal - precisely because it is final and I don't like it!  Yes I know I am not dismissing it forever, and can and will review any dismissed items, but it is that sense of finality that helps me to make an informed decision.  It is not the "easy" option - it is a conscious decision to say "I am not going to have this item on my list (at this present time)".  Without that need to evaluate my commitment to that item I would just carry on doing what I have always done, regardless of whether it is productive for me or not.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2009 at 23:42 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My question is about whether or not to keep some kind of record of dismissed tasks.<br><br>If you try to delete a song from your ITUNES music library, you are given a choice:  whether you want to a) delete the song from ITUNES but still keep a copy of it on your hard drive  OR  b) delete the song from ITUNES and also delete it from your hard drive, thus making it lost forever.<br><br>When I dismiss a task from my "Autofocus" list, I like to know that there is some warehouse  where the dismissed task can go and perhaps be reviewed at some later date.

The task had many chances to get done, and now "its time is up."   And this would suggest that when you dismiss a task, you do not need to keep any record of it thereafter.  <br><br>Thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2009 at 13:43 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Steve<br><br>Dismissed items are not gone for ever - they are just not part of what is important for us at this present point in time. The fact that the dismissed items are highlighted makes it easy to see which items are dismissed from a quick scan through.  Adding a task to your AF list to "review dismissed items" periodically gives the opportunity to reinstate those items if it seems appropriate at some future date.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2009 at 14:05 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Of course you keep a record of the dismissed tasks. It even says so in the instructions: »Use a highlighter to mark dismissed items.« This is the beauty of the auto-focus system (at least for me): I no longer need a separate list for »someday«-stuff. I put anything in that I should, might or can do. One of the items I added today was »repaint kitchen«. It's quite unlikely that I will start this in the next couple of weeks (but we'll see about that) -- whatever happens, it's in the 'system'. If I don't get around to it, the task gets dismissed, highlighted and is remembered as long as I want. I also put a long list of films in the system: three complete pages got dismissed almost immediately (didn't feel like ordering any of them). Never mind, the point is I have recorded them. So, yes, you keep a record. That's the whole idea.<br><br>If, on the other hand, you find a page with items that you decide not to do after all -- then you don't dismiss the page: you cross out these items and move on.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2009 at 14:12 | Olaf B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
