Flexible Autofocus is here!</h1> <ul data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I do not know whether I am blowing things out of proportion here, but I have to say that FAF might just be THE most important time management system made by Mark Forster.<br><br>I say this because, being one of the oldest members of the website, I can remember how important AF1 was. Autofocus 1 was originally THE Autofocus, and it was amazing how simple and effective AF1 was compared to the other ways of handling tasks at the time. As I mentioned in the blog article announcing FAF, it only had the glaring and crippling problem with how it handled urgent tasks.  This website grew from that point on because all the other systems made later by Mark were either attempts to fix this handling of urgent items by AF1 (the other autofocuses from AF2 to SuperFocus and DWM) to outright abandoning of the original "standing out" process (randomizer, FV/FVP, No-List systems, etc).  Even the other members (like me) started to tweak and make their own task management systems.<br><br>There however was a problem with all the proposed systems to improve and replace AF: they do not FEEL like AF1.  AF1 has a unique feel and even fun to it that even with its flaws made it an efficient way to handle tasks.  <br><br>But if FAF can hold to its promise of being flexible and still retain the feel and fun of using AF1, then this one system has just made almost all the other systems in this website obsolete.<br><br>And that just might be the case.  I have been using FAF since yesterday and, although it might be too early to tell, FAF does retain the feel of AF1, and yet it handles urgent items flawlessly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2017 at 17:37 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm very excited about this modification to AF1 as well, I also happened upon this site when AF1 was first developed. I remember being amazed at how quickly I got caught up with my work. I have one question about dismissal though - it was one of the most powerful features of AF1. Any way of getting it back? Any thoughts on the implications of not having dismissal? I'm thinking, if, like AF1, you first came across a page where nothing stood out, you still put the page "on notice" for dismissal as per instructions. Moving forward through the system, dismissal would no longer work, but it might still work at least for that first page. Thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2017 at 18:35 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Paul MacNeil: "I have one question about dismissal though - it was one of the most powerful features of AF1. Any way of getting it back?"<br><br>I remember Mark and the others talking about the role of dismissal in AF and we had a phase of "no dismissal" for a time here.  We did find out that AF1 might work well without the dismissal process (although AF2, AF4 and some others will not), as long as you add a task like "Prune list" or something like that to give yourself permission to streamline your list.  I myself do not like AF1's original dismissal procedure and I am happy with just the "Prune list" task in my AF list.<br><br>Of course you can add something like an expiration date to the first page or maybe a running counter on the first or more pages you just passed through, but I recommend not adding anything first to your list processing aside from the "streamline list" task line and just get a feel of vanilla FAF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2017 at 19:00 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi everyone  -  I too am excited about FAF, and it's quite funny that it's meant to achieve the very opposite of the verb "to faff around":  to spend time on a non-productive activity; "waste time".

However, in using FAF I find myself not being bothered by procrastination much compared to Fast FVP, and I think the reason is that FAF supports better my current thinking on the relationship between work, leisure, play, and rest.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2650343">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2650343</a><br><br>For Fast FVP, I needed a "Relax/Play Card" because the system was not flexible enough to include play and rest in the list.  But now with FAF I found I do not need it.  I only have to ask myself an algorithm of questions and those are good enough to get me focused.  Those questions are:<br><br>1. Am I well rested? If yes go to #2, if not take a nap or something like that (if I wanted to I'll mark my "Rest/Nap" task in FAF)<br><br>2. Am I relaxed? If yes go to #3, if not take a few deep breaths.  If that worked go to #3, if not use FAF to play.<br><br>3. Is it leisure time? If yes use FAF for leisure, if not use FAF for work.<br><br>This kind of thinking is almost impossible for Fast FVP, but for Flexible AF it's almost trivial.  Also, I think this handles your concern about "the tendency of catch-all lists to process lots of trivia."<br><br>For &lt;Time spent scanning&gt; and &lt;Time spent choosing&gt;, no actually I did not find this problem.<br><br>For &lt;Excessive fragmentation&gt; and &lt;Loss of momentum&gt;, I think this has been offset by FAF's ability to focus on the last pages of the list without neglecting all the other pages of the list.  Being able to focus on the last pages of the list encourages "little and often" to a better degree, yet FAF can easily go to the older pages if needed.<br><br>The next post I found about the weaknesses of catch-all systems is <br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/1/25/types-of-lists-i-the-catch-all-list.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/1/25/types-of-lists-i-the-catch-all-list.html</a><br><br>I really like how this post mentions the "Someday/Maybe" list from GTD.  Vanilla AF1 excels at making one by keeping the dismissed pages.  I remember having a love-hate relationship with the dismissed pages of AF1 because I will never forget these "Someday/Maybe" tasks as they are written down and even highlighted, but knowing I have these tasks in limbo, waiting for me to decide whether I will do them or not, just gave me anxiety.  I am glad FAF took that away.<br><br>However this is the verdict of that post as to catch-all systems' biggest flaw: "The biggest advantage is completeness, but this is only achieved at the price of losing focus - or at the very least having to do a lot of work on keeping your focus."<br><br>I think I answered that earlier.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2017 at 16:07 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; What is it that makes you so excited about Fast AutoFocus? &gt;&gt;<br><br>I assume you mean Flexible Autofocus (FAF)<br><br>My experiences with the system after five days are as follows:<br><br>1. It's much faster than AF1, even more addictive and even less stressful.<br><br>2. The result of being able to pass over pages with just a perfunctory scan is that tasks of similar priority and/or time requirement tend to get clumped together. <br><br>3. The result of 2. is that these clumped tasks tend to get cleared together when there is a suitable time available to do them.<br><br>4. The clumping also means that you can look at pages on the list and identify what the common features of the remaining tasks are. This makes it easier to consciously or subconsciously identify when the time is ripe to do them.<br><br>5. At this stage I feel that I have done the best with the time available.<br><br>Here are the stats (there are 31 tasks to a page).<br><br>Page 1 24 actioned<br>Page 2 21<br>Page 3 31<br>Page 4 28<br>Page 5 29<br>Page 6 30<br>Page 7 31<br>Page 8 25<br>Page 9 31<br>Page 10 23<br>Page 11 21<br>Page 12 1 (out of 9)<br><br>That means that out of 350 tasks on the list I have actioned 295, leaving 55 yet to be actioned.

I had a rave review of Fast FVP before but I burned out quickly on it because I was basically starting to work on everything without consideration of what size of tasks I should work on. FAF (speaking of naming conventions, maybe it could be called "AF5"? Or maybe "FlexAF" since we keep mixing it up "Fast" and "Flexible") has me starting a lot of the right things I've been meaning to get started on, because there is some prioritization and consideration of what I'm really ready to get started on. <br><br>Cricket:<br>&lt;&lt; One entry might be Make calls.

I think that helps a lot. <br><br>No-List also helped with interruptions and is completely flexible in that regard. Add interruptions that you need to deal with now to the end, then get back to what you were doing afterward (if it's still relevant).<br><br>When I was working FAF yesterday, between getting started on some projects that I really wanted to kick off, I dealt with various work-emergencies and broke those down into substeps as needed by adding them to the end and going straight to that.<br><br>I actually didn't end up making it to the end of the list at all on my first day (I started with my existing Fast FVP catch-all list).<br><br>It seems that FAF is not quite as flexible as I need it to be, unless I switch to putting a No-List FVP on the end when needed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 January 2017 at 22:17 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Don R<br><br>&lt;&lt; I actually didn't end up making it to the end of the list at all on my first day &gt;&gt;<br><br>The whole idea of FAF is that you can move much faster round the list than with AF1.

I want to do this right now!", and the counter-intuitive one of "Oh heck no I'm not going to touch that with a ten foot pole."  <br><br>There are a few ways to deal with the repellant stand-outs: break them down to smaller tasks, cross them out, schedule each for a committed concentrated effort, delegate them, or outright do them, among possible other ways.  Because of these, I found that being more sensitive of the repellant stand-outs is one good way of "dismissing" in FlexAF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2017 at 17:41 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>After trying both "The Bounce" and "The Natural Selection of Tasks" I have come back to Flexible Autofocus.  The two former seem to be good systems but for me Flexible Autofocus is better.<br><br>For "The Bounce", what dissuaded me was that I was not willing to discontinue my old list just so I can try it fairly; I used it on my old list.  Flexible AF felt better to use. Besides, the two main advantages Mark mentioned about the system-"It is very responsive to circumstances, time of day, etc" and "No need to have separate lists for work, office, home, etc."-are also in Flexible AF, because of "clumping".  As mentioned by Mark above, <br><br>"Tasks of similar priority and/or time requirement tend to get clumped together. The result...is that these clumped tasks tend to get cleared together when there is a suitable time available to do them.  The clumping also means that you can look at pages on the list and identify what the common features of the remaining tasks are. This makes it easier to consciously or subconsciously identify when the time is ripe to do them."<br><br>As for "The Natural Selection of Tasks", I sorely missed the "clumping" effect of Flexible AF.  Besides, the mentality of my task list as "A wide-ranging list of everything that you might do" has been in my mind for years now; I think that's why I am loathe to discard my list for a new one.<br><br>On the side, I thought of using TNSOT's "dismissal" process on Flexible AF but I never did try it because it theoretically fits too perfectly into Flexible AF that it would most likely increase compulsion of doing something in a page just so it would not be dismissed first thing in the morning/last thing in the evening.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2017 at 23:26 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym,<br><br>"After trying both "The Bounce" and "The Natural Selection of Tasks" I have come back to Flexible Autofocus.

The "big rocks" do not get much attention if I leave it all up to AF or any other of these methods, but with SMEMA, I typically enter a big rock in the 2nd or 3rd position. Once I get going, I tend to reenter the same big rock in alternate slots with small things in between, which can be more AF sessions.<br><br>I also enter (on SMEMA) things like "tasks @home" meaning I will scan my AF list for stuff that can only be done at home, before I leave for a long period.

This was not alleviated by having a "weed list" task since I usually notice the aberrant stand-outs while just scanning the list without even encountering the "weed list" task.  <br><br>The solution was introducing a "Reverse FAF Mode".  <br><br>If I encounter a "reverse stand-out" in my list, I mentally switch gears into "Reverse FAF", in that I would do vanilla FAF on my list but instead of looking for items that "stand out" because they are ready to be done, I choose items that repel me, things that I really do not want to do, things that I have been procrastinating, and I mark them with an x instead of a • like I usually do to distinguish to myself this mode of FAF.  These "reverse stand-out" items I then re-word, schedule for "focus time", delegate, remove, or outright just do.  Once I am satisfied that I will not find any more "reverse stand-out" items anywhere in the list, I go back to "Vanilla FAF".<br><br>Some surprising advantages I found in using "Reverse FAF" are (1) it is a great way to start the day, as it encourages surveying the whole list, and (2) it can be used anytime one feels a resistance in using the FAF list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2017 at 4:12 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I mark them with an x instead of a • like I usually do to distinguish to myself this mode of FAF.

Can I just confirm that you are identifying and taking action on the "reverse items" one at a time, rather than identifying them all at once and then dealing with them in bulk?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2017 at 12:34 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark Forster:<br><br>Yes, only one at a time, just like I am doing FAF but choosing a different kind of tasks.<br><br>And yes I agree that this might just work with other systems as well.

Or, more exactly, I think it is the "change of goal" that is its main strength, in that when you go "reverse FAF" you look at the list in a new light, and the list becomes fresh again.<br><br>But Mark Forster gave me a new idea when he mentioned dealing tasks in bulk.  They still are in the preliminary testing phase, and yes the system still is FAF albeit with some addons, but the tweaks are looking promising.  They seem to give FAF the advantages of FVP, the Next Hour, and maybe even SuperFocus, as well as deliver what I had been looking for in previous systems that I had made like CAF, yet totally retain the feel of AF1 and the advantages of FAF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 April 2017 at 21:28 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Everytime I have used this tweak my most resisted upon tasks kept on getting done, so even though I have been using this for only 5 days I decided to post about it and see what others think. I don't have a name to call it yet, you guys think of one.<br><br>1. Decide on a context, period of time, purpose, or what not for doing your tasks.  For example: "I want to do what I can in one hour", "I want to clean my home", "I want to do all the things I need to do on the computer," etc.<br><br>2. Scan your whole FAF list and dot • the tasks that fit your context/time period/purpose.<br><br>3. Start from the beginning and do vanilla FAF, marking the tasks that are ready to be done with an ✗.  Note that you have no obligation to ✗ the tasks you have marked with •.<br><br>4. You can always mark more tasks that fit your context/time period/purpose with • even while doing FAF, but all tasks marked with • must be dealt with before you decide on another context/time period/purpose.<br><br>So what this tweak does is that it gives you a push to do the tasks you marked, but in my opinion it has the perfect balance between leniency and urgency.  It is lenient in that you do not need to do the marked tasks right away, but urgent in that it won't let you start another "session" of context/time period/purpose without finishing the tasks you have marked with •.<br><br>From these descriptions I hope you can see what I mean when I said it has the advantages of Next Hour, FVP, and even SuperFocus, while retaining the feel and advantages of FAF.<br><br>And oh yes I still do "reverse stand-out" but I now see it as a possible session using this tweak.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 April 2017 at 3:39 | nuntym</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
