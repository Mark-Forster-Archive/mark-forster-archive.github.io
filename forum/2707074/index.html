What's the purpose of it?<br><br>I can think of three reasons why I should do it:<br><br>— To force oneself, or to ensure, that one will give as much effort as possible to reach those goals on a daily basis. After all, this is the only thing one has under control about the whole thing: do I give as much as I can today?<br><br>— Or more conservatively, just to regularly improve one's performance, because the formality of a goal setting system gives one a point for self-evaluation.<br><br>— Using formal goals as a means to decide what to do (giving the "why" for your effort) and establishing accountability and evaluation.<br><br>These are all a summoned under the heading "improvement of self conduct", perhaps.<br><br>— But there is always a feeling that I need more perspective, more overview over my activities than what a single long list can provide. Even when using DIT I always wanted to have a "big picture" overview of some sort. But why is that? Pondering that, I never could find a good answer.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2018 at 0:32 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Goals as you have described them are all about FORCING yourself to do something (you even use the word). The trouble with forcing yourself is that you will eventually rebel against it - and even if you succeed with the goal you may find in the end that it wasn't really worth all the effort you put into it.<br><br>A useful exercise is to take a time period (yesterday/the past week/the past month/the past year/the past decade) and ask yourself "If what I've done over this period is one hundred percent in accordance with my real goals, what would those goals have been?"<br><br>In the past I've identified some very important themes in my life using this question, and also saved myself from going down paths which in the end would not have satisfied me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2018 at 1:44 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great question.

Mark's "simple framework" gives the mind something to latch on to, some better-than-nothing options. You get some structured procrastination, your #2 or #3 or #7 priority finished, instead of a big fat nothing. If #1 were on the table, we could feel bad about that, but if you were ready to lie around in bed all day, then #1 was probably never on the table.<br><br>There are times when even a simple framework won't help, and I will lie around instead of even looking at any kind of list. A more complex tight-laced system won't help me out of those situations either. The fact is, I don't need to be helped out of them.

For myself I need a very rigid structure with lots of forcing to do things. It seems to be the only thing that works for me so I don't miss deadlines etc and I feel much happier as a result. If I pick things out I want to do, then it all goes badly wrong. <br><br>Indeed, having done lots of forcing and imposing a rigid structure of when to do things for a while now I will stick to it.<br><br>However, I think others will need other approaches to hit the right thing that works for them. e.g. standout, intuition, etc.<br><br>I'm wondering now if there is no particular right way of doing things. Instead, it is a case of finding a way of doing things that works best for you. If you keep switching systems, then the search for the right system should continue!

"<br><br>Oh, I don't find it the least bit evil (not sure if you were referring to my posts though). It did used to make me anxious, with all those "deadlines" approaching, but I've finally seen through that! I have an ADD-ish source of power that kicks in at just the right moment to avoid real catastrophes, and that seems to suffice. It might not be that way for everyone, I don't know. I may even have actual ADD, I don't know that either.<br><br><br>MrBacklog:<br>"For myself I need a very rigid structure with lots of forcing to do things..."<br><br>I used to say the same, and I accomplished some apparently great things through strong self-discipline with a rather negative edge. I honestly believed that would be my lifelong secret weapon and was rather proud of it, but shockingly it turned out unsustainable. At the same time, I discovered that the meaning of "great" had often shifted long before I'd reached my goal. But due to my amazing "discipline," I was unwilling to shift with it. Instead, I complimented myself for hollow victories and interpreted others' well-meaning praise as evidence that I had done well, as if others would know what makes me happy.<br><br>Meanwhile, the two skills that I value most are those that I developed without any exercise of willpower whatsoever: computer programming, which I did as a hobby from grade school on up and is now my career, and playing the guitar which I taught myself by ear, by playing for 2+ hours a day after school from about age 12 onward. The guitar may stretch this premise a bit, since I did have mandatory classical piano lessons before that, which definitely built a foundation for my free-wheeling approach to the guitar. Still, unlike the piano, I never did force myself to pick up the guitar (not that I could ever hope to pick up a piano!), never did set a timer for the mandatory amount, did not have any assigned pieces to memorize... I simply turned on the radio and attempted to play what I heard. Eight months of lessons helped to fill in some gaps after I got my bearings, but they were informal, and I stopped them once I learned enough to chew on for a while. So without the piano lessons, maybe I would be less skilled at the guitar, but I think I still would have played it just as much. Maybe more, since I wouldn't have had to divert time to the piano!<br><br>By all appearances, I exercised great willpower to put in all those hours of practice, sheer trial and error, learning by sweating, on both the computer and the guitar. But no, it was an entirely different experience and one I have not been able to duplicate in adulthood. I still enjoy playing the guitar occasionally, but not for hours. A few years ago, I tried to force myself into it with a lesson book and a time table, a checklist, a  video series, etc. I had plenty of spare time for it, but it just wouldn't stick. I even built a soundproof studio in my basement--any musician's dream! But it doesn't call to me anymore. I can punish myself over it or let it be.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 April 2018 at 2:56 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie:<br>Yes, I think forcing should only be used in a constructive way. If the task is at odds with overall goals, then forcing is not right.<br>I'm more thinking of giving myself a shove to get started and then I know after a while I enjoy the task. But I need that bit of force applied in the first place.<br>Take Mark's comment above which I can turn into: <br><br>Voice of intuition:<br>"This is an important deadline coming up".<br>The new me: Oh dear, I don't want to do that, it looks hard work but I'll force myself to do a bit of it now...<br>"This is an Important Deadline coming up"<br>The new me: I'll do a bit more...<br>"This Is An Important Deadline Coming Up!"<br>The new me: I'm enjoying this, not as bad as I thought, I'll do a bit more.<br>Great, all done, don't know what the fuss was about. Glad I did not miss the deadline as that would be at lot worse.<br><br>Now, it is easy of course to say this, but putting into practice is a lot harder. However, I have found that forcing myself just at the right time has led to quite a breakthrough in getting things done. No longer are those tasks sitting there nagging me in the back of my mind. I know they will all get done.
