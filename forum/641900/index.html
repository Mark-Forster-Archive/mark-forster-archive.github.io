How about using OneNote just to set up your pages (takes about 3-4 minutes to type out a page), and then transferring open items to Outlook Task Manager with the category of the the relevant page number?  That would keep each page as a closed list.  The way you mention above would effectively have open lists as you would be adding new items to replace cleared ones on a page and would result in you being left with the high resistance items.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2009 at 15:19 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am using Michael Linenberger’s Total Workday Control setup within Outlook's To-Do list.  I find value in the concept of prioritizing truly high priority tasks, “aging” out tasks naturally, future dating tasks so they appear when actionable and allowing the automation in Outlook handle recurring tasks.  To incorporate AF into that, I did two things:<br><br>1)  I added a number next to all tasks.  E.g. 1-Read MF forums.<br>2)  After 35 tasks, I enter a new task called "-----PAGE BREAK-----".<br><br>This allows me to then print off the pages using the “Only selected rows” option.  It works quite well, I get the benefit of the closed list while retaining the significant benefits of Outlook and automation.<br><br>--K<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2009 at 15:32 | Ken</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Christine B,<br><br>I am not sure what you mean by transferring items from OneNote to Outlook.  I know one can create Outlook tasks from OneNote.  Is this what you meant?  Or do you mean physically cutting and pasting from one to the other?

If you are using the same sized monitor and keep Outlook in full screen then you will have the same number of lines that are visible at any one time (for my monitor, I counted 38 which is similar to an A4 notebook). With your second view (the one that only shows tasks that don't have a page allocated to them or whatever more complicated filter you might set up so that you are effectively seeing the last page of AF), all you need do is enter tasks until you come to the end of the Outlook "page" (ie when you add any more tasks, the window starts scrolling) at which point you select all tasks and allocated them to a new page category. Voila, you should now have a fresh clean page.<br><br>I was thinking that for the first view, you don't actually need to set it up so that you're only seeing tasks with a page allocated (unless of course you put in tasks into Outlook that are not part of Outlook but then you'd need more advanced filters anyway) - the first view just needs to be all your tasks but with the page categories showing (so you can track your progress and know when to dismiss) and sorted by creation date. <br><br>It would be a little work setting up the two views in the first place but afterwards, it would be quite simple to use.<br><br>Please let me know if any of these instructions need clarifying.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2009 at 21:29 | Catherine CS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi David<br><br>Sorry my post wasn't clear - I meant creating an Outlook Task (or appointment).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 0:16 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ken - can you elaborate a bit more on your solution ?<br>Thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 7:50 | L</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm using Outlook 2003, sorting by start date, and printing out the whole list once a week, which gives me the standard length pages. <br><br>During the week I'm currently adding all new tasks twice - once into Outlook and once onto my printout, so both ways are always up-to-date. Not ideal, but when I got snowed in today and had to work from home I was glad my list wasn't sitting in a notebook in my office! I'll probably work out the best way soon and either go all-digital or all-paper.<br><br>Anyway, one niggling little thing... Although I sort by start date in ascending order (so tasks added at later dates appear further down the list), the individual tasks always appear at the top of that particular date's tasks rather than the bottom! Anyone know how to fix this?

So if you use start dates (and you always set them to "today"), you can group by them, and in addition sort by creation date, so the order of the items under one 'page' (= one group) will always stay the same.<br><br>IMO, grouping (or a combination of grouping and sorting) is better than simple sorting. You don't need dummy 'page break' tasks, and you can expand one 'page' only, while collapsing all the others. This gives you a better 'closed list' effect.<br><br>Grouping can be accessed by a right click on the headers of the task view, choosing something like "define current view" (unfortunately, I don't know how exactly it's called in an English version of Outlook, I have a German version of OL 2003) at the end of the context menu, and then using the 'group' button. The same goes for sorting. The sort order will only work inside of the groups. Creation date will only be accessible when you set it to show all date/time fields. And while you're at it, you can filter out done items.<br><br>OTOH, this also shows that the solution I proposed earlier does *not* work, unfortunately. Outlook builds a group for every creation date *and* for every creation time. So you'll end up having lots of groups of single items.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2009 at 20:59 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Grouping is great, and you can get Outlook to group by page. I haven't been using the system long, but I'm assigning my tasks a page number under Categories - just "1", "2" etc - and then sorting the whole task list by Categories as the primary sort function. (If Categories isn't already a sortable field in Tasks, you can add it by right-clicking on the title bar and selecting Field Chooser.)  Using groups as Alex W describes, and sorting by category, Outlook can automatically group your tasks by "page", rather than date, without any extra break lines.<br><br>Also, Outlook (2003 in my case too) tells you how many tasks are in each group, so it's easy to keep your pages separate. This works on my (rather antiquated) PDA too, as I can get it to display just the active tasks on a particular page number.<br><br>I do have Outlook 2007 at home though, so would be really interested to find out more about integrating the list with  OneNote.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2009 at 21:53 | Ellie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>PS sorry if I've repeated others - am typing this on my mobile on a train so trying to follow the thread as best I can!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2009 at 21:58 | Ellie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alex, you're a genius!
