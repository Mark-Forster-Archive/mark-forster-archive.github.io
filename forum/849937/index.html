That curiosity caused the task to "feel ready to be done".  So I switched.<br><br>That curiosity about the mechanics of the system has continued to draw me to Forward Mode several times.  <br><br>I am really liking the results -- I am feeling "on top" of my list again.

That must be a good thing!  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>You've just not heard yet ;-)  Actually, I've done a good bit of tweaking but I don't think it serves anyone well to post a lot of tweaks to something so new.<br><br>But since you asked:<br><br>- I test all newly added items: "Will I REALLY do this in the next week?"  (If no, I dismiss it right then.  (Adding it first allows me to keep the grass catcher attribute of AF.  Dismissing it immediately keeps AF clean of clutter.)<br><br>- I replaced the AF1 dismissal rule into the Forward Mode.  (I foresaw the infinite loop problem and this prevents it.)<br><br>- I allow immediate "rescue" of dismissed tasks and add them to the END of the list with a ! (I wish I could remember who gave me that idea.)  This solves my problem of being forced to dismiss items I don't want to ... yet it should not allow a cop out.  We'll see.<br><br>- I keep a 20 minute timer going in both modes and check where I am when it goes off.  (I was originally going to switch based on the timer but experience showed me that I was often in the middle of something and so could not switch anyway).<br><br>- My first scan of the day is to pull off high priority items and put them on my MUST DO TODAY list ... that list gets worked first and I only start AF when I can no longer progress there.  When I hit a "switch" condition, I first go back to that MUST DO list before I go to the other AF Mode.  So my sequence is:<br><br>.- AF Scan<br>.- Must Do List<br>.- AF Reverse Mode<br>.- Must Do List<br>.- AF Forward Mode<br>.- etc.<br><br>Formalizing how I embed AF into the other parts of my systems has helped considerably.<br><br>I've made some "mechanical" changes which don't affect the rules of AF.  I'm still working from a pocket notebook but I think I'll make the backup recording in Excel to monitor statistics a permanent thing.  (If I ever get the spreadsheet working the way I want.  I did try to collect the statistics manually but after coming up with different task counts every time I counted, I gave up on that idea ;-)<br><br>But all of these tweaks are to accommodate how I work ... and I do work differently than many others so I can really see RAF needing many fewer tweaks over all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 July 2009 at 20:05 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike,<br><br>All those tweaks make it seem really complicated to me.  I'd never be able to remember, let alone follow, all those rules.  <br><br>(But if it works for you, great!)<br><br>On the "endless loop" problem -- I have actually come to like this effect.  It gives you repeated exposure to those early tasks in your book.  That repeated exposure helps overcome resistance.  <br><br>If I find that even after that repeated exposure, they are still not getting done, then I can just decide to delete them, or put them on review.  <br><br>But if you make it a rule to just always put them on review before switching back to Reverse Mode, you lose this repeated exposure.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 July 2009 at 20:47 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>Wow!<br>I seem to achieve all those things without needing to use any tweaks at all. I've taken action on every single one of the first 323 tasks which I put on the new list that I started ten days ago.<br><br>Have you actually tried it without tweaks?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 July 2009 at 20:50 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>Do you pre filter your tasks? I'm amazed that you've actually done something on every one of your tasks! I find myself adding a number of tasks which, on review, would essentially be a diversion from the goals I really want to achieve.  Really useful to have written them down in AF but I'm not sure that I would necessarily expect to be do something on all of them.<br><br>Martin</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 July 2009 at 21:25 | Martin H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Here's the thing ... with AF1 things were going much better than my "old" way.  My list was getting longer and I was starting to get just a bit frustrated with myself but it was all good.  (I think I was up to something like 30 pages of 15 items each ... I don't recall how many tasks were open.  (I'll report better soon, I hope.)<br><br>Then AF2 came along and things speeded up greatly.  Kudos for that.  But my frustration level went much higher because of that "moving line of doom".  My frustration increased to the point that I had to figure out how to deal with it and I decided a complete overhaul was required.<br><br>Just as I was about to implement MY system, you announced RAF.  RAF did not have the changes I figured I needed for ME to work MY way and get things done to a level satisfaction.  But when I compared my system (with AF2 as an integral part of it vs. with RAF as an integral part of it) it made sense to use RAF with my changes rather than stick with AF2.  (If that makes any sense to you.)<br><br>So the system I am implementing (testing right now) is as I partially described ... RAF with the changes I found I needed from being frustrated with AF2.  (Basically keep the list clean and small and have priorities in my face.)<br><br>Have I tried RAF with no changes?  No.  The thing is that each time I try the system without the changes I feel I need, I just thrash around and get frustrated.<br><br>I will never be able to use a system that does not have a feature to schedule and prioritize.  My mind does not work in such a way as to allow me to be successful without priorities and schedules.  Think of it this way ... how frustrated would YOU be if you tried to use a system that required priorities and scheduling things to do during the day rather than using your intuitive approach?  That would probably work just as poorly for you as "leaving it to my intuition" does for me.<br><br>If RAF would not leave me with crucial things undone at the end of the day, I'd jump right in.  But without having a list of a half-dozen or so things that MUST be done today staring me in my face ... I'm lost.  I just can't afford to let those things get mixed in with "Wash the Car" and "Mop the Floors" and "Re-read Dickens".  LOL ;-)  Remember ... ADD!  ;-)  Your methods work well to help those with ADD ... except where something is crucial with respect to time ... then they play into our weakness ... distraction.  Given enough time, I'd see the important things ... but perhaps too late.<br><br>Now, all of that said, one possibility is that I'll hit a patch where there is nothing crucial going on and so, by default, I'll be working RAF with check-ins to a NULL High Priority list which will be closer to RAF.  At which point I may have a revelation.  Or not.  Who knows?<br><br>I can tell you one thing for sure ... the simple modification of asking if I am committed to doing a new task this week, right after adding it, has made the most difference.  In my transition, I asked that question of every item on my list and pages just vanished.  I went crazy with dismissal.  With the question now encoded in my procedure, maybe 10-20% of new tasks are instantly dismissed.  (Squirrel!   ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 July 2009 at 22:00 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>MartinH:<br><br>No, I don't pre-filter my tasks at all.

ROTF ;-)  It is not so much that I'd put something like that on my list ... I'd not.  It might find its way into my long range goal planning ... but would not go on my To Do list.  But what DOES get on there, and needs to be filtered (in my case) is the random "That might be something interesting to do someday" kind of thing.  It is that "someday" that gets lost unless I "test it".  It is probably just a processing glitch I've always had.  My filters, in this case, don't work so well as yours do ... i.e. they don't work automatically in a reliable way.  Another way to look at it is that everything fascinates me and I can imagine that I'd like to do it ... of course, I can't and won't, but while you automatically know and filter, I don't unless I think to ask myself ... or I get a clogged up To Do list and wonder why the "real" stuff is getting lost in the shuffle. <br><br>RE: your flicker example ... as I process things I would not know to take the item off of my list if I did not have a rule to ask the question.  IOW, MY system coped perfectly, but MY system has a rule to ask that question ... you do so automatically (as I understand it).<br><br>RE: 34 years ... O.K.  Gotcha.  Then for some reason you are able to work in both kinds of system.
