One consistent problem I have is that I build up increasing resistance to looking at the list at all. In fact, looking back, my previous attempts at time management have generally been writing lists which I use for a few days then abandon and find several years later!<br><br>Does this sound familiar to any other disorganised souls out there? Is the best response to declare a backlog to keep the list as small as possible to keep 'list resistance' at bay.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 July 2010 at 17:17 | Nuje</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is a form of procrastination, so you probably may benefit from the procrastination thread.  The biggest point there is to ask yourself why.  Different answers merit different remedies.<br><br>The second biggest point there is to overcome that resistance.  So you don't want to look at the list?  Do it anyway.  Just because.  What happens when you do this?  Does the resistance go away or is something bothering you even as you work the list?<br><br>Regrading keeping the list small, I say absolutely no question.  Get everything you don't plan to work on soon off that list.  Declaring a backlog, I might do that once, but after that try to keep your list from growing out of control..</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 July 2010 at 18:34 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Alan.<br><br>I'll take a look at that thread and ponder on the reasons for procrastination.<br><br>I've set one of my daily passwords to a rude mnemonic to remind me to look at the list. That helps keep it in my mind!<br><br>Generally I feel guilty about not looking at the list, a feeling of relief when I force myself to do it but then more resistance over the next few days. The 'i'll just get the file out' principle does help to some extent though.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2010 at 23:20 | Nuje</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Nuje,<br><br>I know in my case that the longer the list = the greater the procrastination.<br><br>Is this the case for you? In my case, I feel that a short daily list (as in DIT) beats a long list (as in AF or GTD). There again, if items are dismissed *appropriately* in AF that is another matter.<br><br>The other thing that makes me feel less like procrastinating is feeling that I'm upto date with my work (even if I don't particularly enjoy the work), and I do feel that a short daily and *realistic* closed list provides the best solution for this.  <br><br>Finally, what do you really *have* to do to keep upto date with your essential work?  I ask this because we can add many things to a list that are really optional - things that can be done, and enjoyed, in a sustainably paced way by approaching them one at a time. <br><br>Let's hear it for DIT!<br><br>Good luck!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2010 at 12:03 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter,<br><br>may I ask some questions? <br>How do you handle your input?

The best method i found is the simpliest.<br>One a4 spiral note book for my af tasks af4...<br>One a4 spiral notes book for my notes and projects with historical significant items<br>One note on .page for complicated project or control of business objectives and development<br>Nothing else exept my a/z file for my buildings with includes <br><br>Second There is a constant exchange between my notes books. <br>My brown note (BRNB) book is for notes<br>My blue note book is for AF<br><br>The best is to give you an example.<br>Yesterday I had a very important appointment for selling a building. I had my BRNB and reported on it the most important points in 2 or 3  sentences<br>Back home I was exhausted but i reported on the blue one the tasks i needed and first give a feet back to the client in the morning and ask him if he needed something else than what i summarized<br><br>When i arrived at my office in the morning i first red my emails. Then i reported on Af what needed to be done. Then i crossed in the all AF what seems to be unusefull, then I highland all tasks i did not know what to do with them or I could not advance with them. <br><br>I noticed there was a lot of tasks <br>So i declared a backlog and put the date of the day in from on the first task of my active list. <br><br>Then I red all the list again and realised that i needed to call the client but it was to early. I just put a dash on it and followed the list. I had an email to do about the appointment so i began the email and let it on my email. <br><br>9.30 my client was here so reading my AF list (the dash first) i call the client and reading my email checked is all was ok. He said yes and added 2 or 3 point I directly completed. <br>I took all the notes on a post it or a block of paper. <br><br>After the call i red the email and realized that it was ok. I check the project it was ok too. So i sent the email to the owner. In the email i needed some doc Taxes incomes, charges, refurbishment past and future and so on. I simply reported on AF Wait for MR SMITH/ BUILDING PARIS Taxes incomes, charges, refurbishment. And in the marging in front of it Wed. 14th july. I thew away the post it. <br><br>Then a call happen it was the accountant about the VAT he told me 2 or 3  methods about i wrote on my block of paper. Then i took the note and put it on my desk. I reported after the call <br>Do the VAT and in the marge 19 th (That is the dead line). But as i wont have time to do it i decided to do it this evening as i could not work. The post it is on my desk I will do it very soon.  It is not very long. And I noted on my AF Vat mail it at the accountant when it will be done. <br>Hope this is clear. <br><br>The main idea is to advance in my work and never, never, never let the AF Groth.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2010 at 13:26 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Jupiter. Mainly your explanation was understandable Jupiter.<br><br> It did get confused a bit by strange words. VAT? <br>Groth? If you mean growth, that's poor grammar but I could understand.

Very interesting. I wish my system could be is simple as yours.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 July 2010 at 11:59 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Roger Thanks ;) Yes it's never let the AF grow. Why ? Just because it becomes impossible to control. If you do one time you may get about 25 pages, what happened to me at the really beginning when i did'nt know how to apply the dismiss rules...<br>@Rainer my system used to be very complicated i wished to mix GTD and AF. Finally i understood that the most important thing was and is still, to do my work. This is the reason why i made it, little by little, very simple and kept what i found "the best of GTD". <br><br>The good principle kept in GTD are still now : <br>1. Collect things<br>2. The 2 mn rule<br>3. Taking time to work on projects<br>4. Taking time to plan your 6 levels or feets (horizons)<br>5. Use some context list such as Errands or Call or Wait from<br><br>But i understood that AF especially on paper produces a special effect. A special feeling, very deep inside of me where i feel that everything is under control. <br><br>So today, Yes indeed my system is simple just because i wanted it operational and efficient.<br>I also realized that in my job, I less needed to make an effort to find my tasks or what i have to do, than to let them come over me like the waves on the see "little by little and often". <br><br>So it's better for me to collect them and act on them when i feel ready to do them in my heart.  <br><br>The best advantage with AF on GTD or every methods i tried is that in fact i don't really have to think or decide about things. <br><br>As MF said the system auto regulate by itself. Believe me at the really beginning of it i laugh about that and could not believe it at all. More, as i knew GTD i thought that this method was a joke and would never work After over 2 years using it and working with it i must say that it is over efficient. I never forgot anything and more i feel quiet even if i am always interrupted.<br><br>Now I understand that the best computer is the one we all have. It's not a Mac or a PC it is my or your brain. Most of ours decisions are intuitive decision. Most of our tasks don't realy need to be done and can be eliminated. Usually Human make things complicated. We have to make it simple.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 July 2010 at 18:33 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nuje: returning to your earlier posts and Leon's response, like Jupiter I favour the handwritten list in whatever system on uses.<br><br>My current adaptation of DWM also uses a Daily Closed List which I set up at the beginning of the day and cull from the main DWM list.  Using a separate Moleskine pocket book, I enter tasks which MUST be done today, then SHOULD be done, and then others from the DWM list.<br><br>Work tasks are entered from the top of the right-hand page (dated manually eg today is 12/07/10), personal/other from the bottom up, then ruled off with a line below the last work task and another one above the last personal task.<br><br>This creates a space into which goes any additional tasks I do during the day.  The left-hand page opposite is used for sundry stuff during the day, eg cash expenses, broadband usage (no unlimited ADSL for me yet here in Damascus), quick contact notes, password for a new web site (later inked out and transferred into eWallet), errand items eg 9kg of drinking water to be hauled up the 76 steps to my apartment, not pleasant in the current run of 44C.<br><br>I have to guard against putting too many items in the Daily Closed List,so I'm considering the 1,2,3 approach mentioned elsewhere, then adding others later via DWM scans etc during the day or just doing them and crossing off the main DWM list.<br><br>One other adjustment to my "system" is that my DWM notebook is also a Moleskine pocket notebook.  This has an elastic band around it so that the DWM list and the Daily Closed List notebooks are always together with me.<br><br>In the DWM book, I do not have separate pages for each date 28 or 7 days hence.  I write that date on the right-hand edge of the left-hand page, then enter the tasks themselves on the right-hand page, using more than one line for a task if necessary, not often.<br><br>Re-entered tasks are written on the left-hand page against the relevant date so that they stand out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2010 at 5:16 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find that the more lines on the page, the more I procrastinate.  I use a small legal pad (7 X 4 3/4) with 22 lines.  I really dislike having more than one page &amp; find myself working as fast as possible to get rid of previous pages as I am able.  I still find it difficult to dismiss items, as I put very few items on my list that don't need to be done.  Some things I work on for a little bit, just to rewrite it at the end of the list, but it keeps me moving forward.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2010 at 15:24 | Debbie M</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
