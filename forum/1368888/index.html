It seems that, in doing tasks, to visualize or imagine what I am doing A FEW SECONDS INTO THE FUTURE with REDUCED (not totally removed) attention to what I am doing presently has actually improved my work: work is done faster and better with less mistakes.  <br><br>I mean it is weird.  It is as if, by imagining I am doing what I will be doing a few seconds from now, I avoid mistakes because I can SEE the results of whatever I imagined to do. Also, it seems to give myself some kind of "muscle memory" or something because once I imagined what I will be doing I need minimal attention to actually do it with smoother actions.  Finally, it removes distractions from stray thoughts because my imagination (the main cause of my distractions previously) is now engaged in my work: I actually am more focused in my work than before in spite of having LESS attention to what I am doing PRESENTLY.  Yet I will still catch any impending problems in my present work, as if I can intuitively catch any impending troubles.<br><br>Weird....but is this how you guys work?  I just caught myself doing this a few weeks ago, and ever since I have consciously used this way of working.<br><br>God bless!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2011 at 2:17 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>there is a theory about this. It seems that "visualize or imagine what I am doing" just a few second before doing mobilize all your energy and intuition from your brain. It seems that your brain believe that it is a crucial thing to do. <br><br>I have red somewhere something and i think mark tested it too ie instead of writing everything just put the keywords with no details or try a little mind map and visualize before doing, justthinking must i do this ? and what can i do first.  The result is that almost is you know perfectly the matter of your work an incredible efficiency. <br><br>These previous principle comes from GTD but I think now that if GTD is great for some principle the exhaustive compilation of all information is just impossible. <br><br>So visualizing is a good way to do things if you don't go to proscratrination.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2011 at 5:59 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've heard about this.  Athletes, such as gymnasts and track runners, use this all the time.  The Apollo 11 trainer used this technique as part of training astronauts for space and the moon.  He recommended it for planning business activity.  I've never before now heard it suggested for ordinary next-step action, but that obviously correlates directly to what gymnasts are doing successfully.<br><br>Jupiter: Name the GTD principle you mean.  I don't remember it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2011 at 13:50 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym:<br><br>This principle - or something like it - is used in Autofocus. When a tasks "stands out" on your list, you are to a greater or lesser extent visualising doing it. This is why once a task has "stood out" it's almost always easy to get started on it, regardless of how much one had been resisting doing it before.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2011 at 14:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nuntym<br><br>This is the basic mind frame that fencers need to attain to survive on the battlefield (at least that's what all the literature about sword fighting in Japan is about). If you don't plan your next move while doing the present one, you won't be able to chain them fluidly together and once your done with your present move, it's too late to think about the next... You're effectively dead!<br><br>This is called being in the FULLY moment. That's how I do most everything in life and it may be why I have never had the procrastination due to distractions problem...

But don't remember exactly where.<br><br>You find this principle in skying. When champion does skying competitions they do many time all the slalom on foot. Then they visualize the all run litlle by little until they pefectly now where the difficulties are and where they will be able to go faster. <br><br>The same happens in business. I often have negotiation. Sometime it's very hard so when I have some difficulties about subjects I visualize the situation. I noticed it makes me cool and efficient. I had the same experience about building analysis. As I did it a thousand times I don't look to my check list (a 100 points) because I visualize all what i have to do. <br><br>H Mac Cormack who is for me one of the best negotiator on the earth, recommended in his book to take some time in the early morning to visualize a first time your all day. He wrote a wonderful book call all you will never learn at harvard in english I guess (I have the French translation) and he perfectly explained this visualization. By the way he had a very simple organization which seemed working very well, for him.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 January 2011 at 7:15 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Works by Mark H.

The day right after I posted this thread I could not replicate the feeling of concentration I had using this! I honestly felt bad about it, so I put it in the back burner of my mind for the time being.<br><br>Then, right after dropping off my nephew at school today, while I was still in the parking lot, I remembered Alan Baljeu's post about "Micro Goals": <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1302019">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1302019</a> What if I made "microgoals" in my mind while I was doing something, concentrate on the microgoal two steps away, and when that microgoal is my next step concentrate again on the microgoal two steps away? <br><br> Well, I tried it...on the drive back to my house (I know, I know, it's foolish to try a new procedure on something so dangerous as driving, but I made sure I did this gradually and carefully, so no one flame me, please? ^___^).  While I was driving, I imagined markers on the lane I was driving on using shadows along it (it was morning so the shadows are quite long).  I concentrated on getting to the marker that was just beyond the marker nearest to me, then when that marker is the one nearest to me I concentrated on the next further away, on so on.  I also used markers on where I should turn, etc.  And what do you know, the concentration I had before was back: no distractions, no daydreaming, no accidents just pure graceful concentration on what I was doing.  When I got home I used the microgoals again for each of the chores there, and it was still working.<br><br>I got the groove back ^__^ Thanks Alan!  And I think that is the easiest way to get to this level of concentration: divide your current task into microgoals, concentrate on getting to the microgoal two steps away, change to the next microgoal when the previous one becomes your current microgoal.<br><br>-----<br><br>@Jupiter, Alan:<br><br>I am aware of visualizing as used by athletes, managers etc.  However, I think this is the first time I was aware of using visualization so proximate to what one is doing, and I was very surprised at how effective it is.<br><br>-----<br><br>@Mark:<br><br>Oh, so part of "standing out" sometimes is when I visualize myself doing it? Interesting... I never thought of it that way before....<br><br>-----<br><br>@Erik,<br><br>&lt;&lt;being in the FULLY moment&gt;&gt;...you mean the "mindfullness" of Buddhism? I thought it was being in the "present", not in the imminent future...isn't it?  But it makes sense for swordsmen, warriors, and soldiers to be doing this, considering how you explained it, but I have never encountered it before.<br><br>Seems I have to read more ^___^  Thanks Erik!<br><br>-----<br><br>@Nicole,<br><br>Yes, I noticed that this too reduces reduces and procrastination, and I have an idea why.  Probably next week I am going to post something about this, let me read some more St. Thomas Aquinas ^___^<br><br>-----<br><br>God bless!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2011 at 16:17 | nuntym</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
