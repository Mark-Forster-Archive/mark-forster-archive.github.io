I wanted something that was quick, unobtrusive and portable. If you work a lot with keyboard shortcuts, this might be for you.<br><br>Here is Version 0.1: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK.exe">http://cloud.github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK.exe</a><br><br>Just download it and save it anywhere on your hard drive. I can run from usb drives, too. All tasks will be saved in a text file in the same directory, so it's 100% portable and leaves no traces elsewhere.<br><br>Okay, here's how to use it. It's probably different from anything you used so far for Autofocus. ^_^<br><br>Start the application, and you get a tray icon that says "af". Right-clicking this gives you a very small menu: About/Help and Exit. About/Help shows an about box with all keyboard shortcuts, Exit closes the application.<br><br>Here are the shortcuts:<br><br>CapsLock + a : Pops up a window where you can enter a new task, which will be added to the end of the list<br><br>CapsLock + d : Shows the current task and asks you if it feels ready to be done. Click yes to start working on it. Click no to go to the next task. Clicking cancel or pressing Esc just closes the window again. <br>If you've worked on something for a while, press CapsLock+d again and it will tell you what you've been working on and whether you want to re-add the task to the end of the list. Yes re-adds, no doesn't, cancel let's you work on the task a little longer.<br><br>CapsLock + c: Shows the current task.<br><br>CapsLock + s: Shows the next 30 tasks<br><br>Note that I use CapsLock for Hotkeys, because I don't have any use for it. If you use CapsLock for anything, you currently can only change the hotkeys in the source and compile it yourself.<br><br>The source can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://github.com/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/tree/master">http://github.com/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/tree/master</a><br><br>Note that version 0.1 lacks forward mode and review mode so far, all you can do is add, do, re-add, and move through the list in reverse mode. But when the next version is ready (tomorrow), you can just copy it over the old one and continue with the same list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 August 2009 at 1:57 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is what you call the the effect of  laziness in past days?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 August 2009 at 4:12 | Silvia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF Forum cheat sheet:<br><br>Andreas Hoffman: writes programs and captains the HMS Autofocus.cc website.

Every day a user-defined time, tasks that are on notice and unactioned are dismissed, then the next block of unactioned tasks is put on notice. When AutofocusAHK is started for the first time, it creates a configuration file, which looks like this so far:<br><br>[ReviewMode]<br>LastRoutine=20090821<br>StartRoutineAt=6<br><br>LastRoutine is the date the last routine ran, this value is updated automatically every day. StartRoutineAt is the time at which you want the morning routine to take place. It can be a value from 0 to 23. Default is 6 in the morning. Depending on when your day starts, you may want to change this. If the app is not running at that time, the morning routine will run immediately when it's started.<br><br>Now I need to implement the review mode itself, then I will release version 0.2.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 August 2009 at 15:56 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Joseph, <br>thanks!

That means you're in the open list. When you're in the closed list, the title says "Pass x - Closed List - AF4". Seems I replaced only the "Pass x" part with "Open List" instead of "Pass x - Closed List". I'll fix it. Btw, when you haven't taken any action on a pass of the closed list, the tilte says "Pass x(!)" to remind you that the closed list will be dismissed if you don't do something.<br><br>"When do tasks get into Closed List from Open List? According to the original instruction, if no items stands out in the Closed List, the tasks will get highlighed (on-notice status) and Open List items will become Closed List items. However, this didn't happen when I began with a new task list and keep clicking 'no.'"<br><br>The thing is, at the beginning there is no closed list, only an open list. That's why no dismissal happened for you when you kept clicking no, because the open list does not get dismissed. At some point, the first open list must be declared closed. The instructions are not specific as to when exactly that should happen. I decided to do it when the list contained enough items to fill a "page". So it depends on what ItemsPerPage in the ini file is set to (default is 15). When you start the application and you have more items  than this, the list becomes closed.<br><br>Perhaps I should add a trigger to the "add task" routine so it can happen without restarting the application in case someone never restarts it (computer always on or only in stand-by).<br><br>"I also used the AF1 mode, which reminded me of the excitement (and sometimes fearness) I felt back in January.

You won't have the added date column, but otherwise it should work fine.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2010 at 22:16 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Andreas! I manually entered everything (which really did not take long) and am enjoying your program.

I am using the app on both my home and work computer (using dropbox to sync, which works great) and I think it is important to follow Mark's rule to start where you left off, so I really look forward to that being implemented.<br><br>After two days of working off your program, I can say it is a elegant and efficient way to work. Thanks ver much for it (and of course for Mark for AF4, and the soon to be DIT2).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2010 at 15:59 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas,<br><br>I'm so sorry to post this here, but couldn't seem to find your website.  Anyway, I had tried your Autofocus program a while back, but wound up deciding to stick with paper.  I thought I deleted the program, but it loads everytime I turn the computer on and is starting to generate error messages.  I probably created a problem by incompletely deleting it.  But I can't figure out where the rest of it is. If there's anyway you could help me to remove it from my computer, I'd be most grateful.  My email is rmyoungesq at gmail dot com, if you want to email me directly.  Thank you so much.<br><br>Rebecca</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 14:25 | Rebecca</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Rebecca:<br><br>The program is pretty much just the one exe file and some text files in the same directory, so if you removed that, the program is gone completely. What you still have is a link in your windows startup folder to my application, generated when you checked "Start AutofocusAHK with windows" in the preferences. So the error message you get is because windows wants to start my application, but can't find it because you deleted it. <br><br>To get rid of the error messages, just open your start menu, go to "All Programs" (or just "Programs", depending on your windows version) and find the folder "Startup". There should be a shortcut called "AutofocusAHK". Right-click it and select delete. That should be it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 14:48 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>vegheadjones:<br><br>Though you seem to have moved back to excel, I implemented the changes you wanted: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK-0.9.2.4.zip">http://cloud.github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK-0.9.2.4.zip</a><br><br>- It now remembers were you were in the list versus always starting from the beginning (in AF1 and AF4)<br><br>- To permanently hide the status window, just hold down the shift key.

AutofocusAHK 0.9.3 will have it. Though I'm sticking with AF5, it does feel more like Autofocus than DIT, especially in the digital implementation. Mark himself said in the comments of the name searching blog post that he thinks "Autofocus" is the best name for the new system.<br><br>On another note, since this thread is getting rather long, I'll start a new thread for the 0.9.3 release. I think I'll make a new thread for every introduction of a bigger new feature (0.9.4, 0.9.5, ... , 1.0) and add small releases (0.9.3.1, 0.9.3.2, ...) to the threads of their corresponding big release.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 15:26 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Looks like you need to lock this one Mark.
