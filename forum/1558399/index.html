Consequently there is no need to come back to the original page since you never left it. <br><br>Doing a task out of order in AF1 should be regarded as a highly exceptional event, not a routine part of the system.

An effective What's Better? list demands a flexible perspective. E.g., you have "wasted" the whole day trimming the hedge and are now trying to work out what is better about that.<br><br>Another way to put this: we need encouragement during those times when our progress flat-lines. Often, that encouragement comes when we recognize the other variables in life, the ones that haven't quite flat-lined. This study is about more than accuracy and objectivity. It is also about a predictive metric. They have envisioned human beings going about their lives with "success" determined in advance. This is their hidden variable, or their unacknowledged assumption.<br><br>But life is not that way. What we thought was success turns out to be only one facet, and more become apparent when the obvious ones have flat-lined.<br><br>When we develop our Visions, we are pursuing exactly this: pursuing the very definition of "success" rather than following slavishly the one we first imagined. Again, a flexible perspective brings power.<br><br>It is really not about "inaccurate" or "fuzzy" or "rough." Those terms entirely miss the point. It is about "flexible."<br><br>It's a great study. As with all studies, keep the data, but draw your own conclusion.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2011 at 4:01 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+JMJ+<br><br>Alan: &lt;&lt;But I'm not convinced your article has anything to do with the original. &gt;&gt;<br><br>On second reading of the article and comparing it to my previous post, I realized that too, Alan!<br><br>Mark: &lt;&lt;You've given a very precise description of what happens in AF1, but unfortunately not an accurate one. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Hmm, maybe I am the only one who does that? &gt;__&lt;<br><br>&lt;&lt;Doing a task out of order in AF1 should be regarded as a highly exceptional event, not a routine part of the system. Therefore it should not be rewarded in any way. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I am aware of this, but I was speculating what would happen if an AF system PROMOTES doing tasks out of order (as long as these tasks are related to what currently "stands out") instead of regarding this as a malevolent exception to the rules.  My hypothesis is that this will enhance the subconscious' role in getting everything done.<br><br>This is, in fact, what I am experimenting on with my CAF.  Most items in my CAF list are already preceded with context labels in the form of two-three letter codes: AM for morning chores, PM for morning chores, OL for online/internet, OLF for online internet "fun"/leisure, etc.  So what I would do is process the list AF1 style, check the current task "standing out", then either do this current task right now or look for other tasks with the same context elsewhere in the list, do them and cross them out.  If at the end of this context-driven cycle the original current task is done then it is crossed out and re-written at the end when needed; however, when the original current task was NOT done, it is still crossed out, yet it MUST be re-written at the end of the list and labeled as "unfinished".<br><br>Currently, the tweak is working really well, but it is too early to say now whether it works because it is a truly superior way of processing tasks or because it is a novelty.  I will post updates on this.<br><br>God bless.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2011 at 4:52 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie: <br><br>&lt;&lt;If our day were somehow evaluated objectively using a rigid metric of "progress,"&gt;&gt;<br><br>How about this. <br><br>What if each of us:<br><br>1.

That social accountability will be great for a lot of people, and I would likely participate if I had a personal assistant to make it happen for me. But as it is, I would rather just use my energy on the actual work and then be glad for myself when it's done. The What's Better list and dialog are giving me all the social accountability I need.<br><br>Perhaps, more in the spirit of what you are saying, my objective/rigid metric is:<br><br>1. Revise my Future Vision and Present Reality each morning (refreshes the goal),<br>2. Dialog with my Future Self when necessary (refreshes the how/why/what),<br>3. Write my What's Better? list each night (review progress indicators).<br><br>Those correspond to your three points in a way that fits my existing work.<br><br>I don't mean to be discouraging.
