As many I love autofocus. The way it works is incredibly efficient for creating new tasks especialy autofocus 4. But SUPERFOCUS has also Incredible powers especialy The way it manages active tasks, urgencies and obligations. <br><br>But using SUPERFOCUS I fond the system complicated, even if I notices a real improvement about doing what I must do.<br><br>So I thought about a new way of Working with The 2 systems + Gtd contexts taking The best of them and using a digital solution with TASKPAPER on iPad. <br><br>I am Still testing it but I confession The system works Nice and is less complicated. <br><br>Here is how it works :<br>1- do a autofocus list<br>2- In front of each task tag it with C1 or C2 (C2 is eitheir urgent or unfinished)<br>3- close The list each day like AF4<br>4- Working on The list is simple : sélect C2 First and do The best you can on C2<br>5 - dont leave C2 until you find nothing to do on it<br>6- Then work on C1 <br>7- you can add tags such as @call and so on, you can also add project In parenthesis.<br>8- you can make Search on words, projects or watever needs your attention.     <br><br><br>Taskpaper on iPad has The REAL advantage to make possible a writing like on paper and an easy sélection of information. For The moment I only put The tasks wich are really actionnable others goes on Omnifocus and it s easy to drag tasks from omifocus to taskpaper. Of course all is synchronised on my mac, my iPhone, my iPad with mobile me and gmail for taskpaper.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 April 2011 at 9:23 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter, how do you handle dismissals?<br><br>It seems to me that the magic of AF/SF is that, unlike other methods, the tasks eventually get done or moved out of the system.<br><br>Like you, I'd like a way to use all my fancy tools (I also have OmniFocus, iPhone, iPad), but so far, paper seems easiest, despite drawbacks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 April 2011 at 14:57 | DS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@DS Excellent question ! <br>For the moment I am not really sure how. <br>One way could be to cross the task. Because Tpaper make the possibility to archive giving a date and I like to see the dissmissed date. <br>One way could be to tag it with @dissmiss<br>One way could be to create a project dissmissed and put it off my list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 April 2011 at 19:51 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The result of my experiments of GTD + Superfocus + and Omnifocus was a wash out after only 3 days ! I completely lost my intuition, I spent a long time maintening the system, I lost my reactivity and feeling of business, it turned me on and I am quiet angry about me. The only interest was to centralised by project all my tasks and notes. <br><br>Anyway this made me realise that handwriting superfocus is much better than anything else. Reading my journal were i speak a lot about organization showed me that I never been more efficient despite of the numbers of tasks that with a pen a paper. <br><br>So I took a new notebook and reported my active tasks on SF erasing them in omnifocus. <br>I kept my notes and copy them in a Macintosh note by project synchronized with mobile me.<br><br>I just finished to do it and suddenly noticed That all things becomes again perfectly clear in my mind. <br><br>So now I only keep OF for listing my projects and deadlines.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2011 at 16:46 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for sharing that with such candor, Jupiter!<br>I have a similar hybrid system, not because I set out to combine systems, but because my older stuff is still in GTD folders and OmniFocus. OmniFocus is so good for dated reminders and deadlines, that I may just keep that part of it. I also like the Someday/Maybe folder, for things that are really not ready to go on the list. It's helpful to hear about your experiences with these tools.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 April 2011 at 22:54 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think I'm getting OmniFocus to work with SuperFocus, basically by using Folders as Pages, similar to Sara's set-up in Toodledo.<br><br>You lose the use folders for another purpose (if you use them), but you gain all the power of OmniFocus plus all the power of SuperFocus.<br><br>I treat the folder as a page for SF scanning purposes, but this folder/page can contain PROJECTS (collapsed or expanded) as well as a list of unrelated actions. A click lets you focus on a project on that page.<br><br>OF also lets you view by Context/Category, which I find handy for a few specific items, like phone calls.<br><br>In practice, I'm approach it in different ways. Sometimes I'll scan the Project List--I feel like this helps me work on priorities. Sometimes I'll scan the Context list--mainly as just an alternative view into the list; I don't work from this very often.<br><br>Primarily, though, I just handle it SuperFocus-style, going through the pages (folders). For column 2 items, I just add a flag. If I need to move the task, I just drag it to the next page, or to last page. Projects I treat the same as a single action: if I work on the project, the whole thing gets moved, a la SuperFocus.<br><br>I'm finding this VERY satisfactory. There are few details I'm finding that help simplify the process (but which would clog up this post), but I'm happy to share if it would be useful to anyone.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2011 at 0:40 | DS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Bernie Thanks ! I like the way you use OF. This is the exact way I gona do with it and SF keeping SF for nothing but was is actionable. <br><br>@DS I tried to do exactly the same and hope you will succeed. My own experiment did when sarah explained his way with toodledo was a mistake. Not because of the system it self which was good, easy and efficient. <br><br>But my real problem was about doing things and intuition.<br>SF is not only task management system (TMS). SF is also an incredible system for increasing intuition, doing things and focusing. Working with SF or even AF4 gives me a real sense of priorities and clarify my aims and visions. It increase my intuition  and leads me little by little to my aims. On the other hand working on digitals for TMS do the opposite. Wanting to rationalize at any price my information and control anything as GTD does has a strange effect with me. It kills my intuition and makes me working worstly little by little increasing proscratrination. <br><br>I did not realized this at the beginning of my experiments when I first discovered AF. I simply noticed the result were good without being able to explain it. <br><br>I know now that for being efficient I must observe some rules.<br><br>1. is to accept the system even if there is no structure with SF it works and there is a real control.<br>2. The most important is the strict observance of the MF rules. To many tweaks kill the system. <br>3. Some GTD Rules are great list of project actives or not, weekly or daily review, working on projects, visualization are some precepts I like. <br><br>There are some others but they are appropriate to my job<br><br>Finally after 4 years of GTD and 3 of AF I understand that there is no perfect system and will never be. I try to act and think more that researching the perfect system or the perfect tool. I try to exchange with other and progress more than trying to find solution always by myself. <br><br>In fact MF systems made me more open to others and I love reading and participating to this forum and this was the last result I would ever imagine about the system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2011 at 20:16 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter, that is so true about digital systems. My GTD/OmniFocus setup led to a near-ridiculous level of over-analysis and mega-planning. After seven years of GTD, I *never* thought I would take seriously the idea of writing everything in one big list ... by hand ... I mean, REALLY? But when I finally discovered AutoFocus, I could not believe how immediately it appealed to me, and even my first missteps with it felt so much better than what I'd been doing!<br><br>As for not tweaking Mark's systems, I have to agree again. Like many of us, I initially came up with all sorts of "improvements," but now I am converging more and more to the canonical way and making it work. Lately, I am respecting dismissal more and more and finding that it really tightens everything up, just like Mark keeps saying it does. It really takes a while of direct experience to grasp these little rules, as simple as they are. All the best ideas are like that!<br><br>Nevertheless, I have to wonder how often Mark feels like the character in Monty Python's Holy Grail, the father of the castle who tells the guards to watch his son: "You stay here, make sure he doesn't leave" ... he turns to go, and the guards follow him out ... "No, *you* stay here, make sure *he* doesn't leave!!" ... etc.  ;)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 May 2011 at 7:11 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi All,<br><br>Back to MF Forum to give you some news about my experiments after almost one month. <br><br>About my tools<br>1. Then, I am very please with Superfocus on my paper notebook. The method works perfectly. I caught the rules and I am happy with it for Acting. <br><br>2. Omnifocus is also perfect for collecting, checking, planning my projects even I did it a little infidelity with taskpaper for a while, I must realise that OF does it well an even very well. Much better than all what I tried. <br><br>About my method.<br><br>I had some difficulties to pass from one to the other. How could I be sure to have collected and controlled all my stuff ? How could I avoid double beam ? <br><br>I found the solution changing my mind and Review my stuff.<br><br>I decided That SF would be only for collecting my thinking little by little without any kind of control. I also decided that Of would be for planning, organizing, feeding also SF with non actionable or future tasks even if I could leave some tasks in SF that was only meaning that these task were immediately actionable or not. (Future dismissed)<br><br>Anyway, for building a bridge beetween these 2 systems I just had to do a little review of my work each day corresponding at the GTD Analyse. Ie working on my project. <br><br>here is how it works.<br>Ie imagin I write on my Sf list work on project X it means works on project x on OF. <br><br>When everything is controled, cleaned, collected The system does it by itself.<br><br> Its also easy to eliminate and report or plan  my tasks and projects in OF. <br><br>A very quick read of all my tasks on SF or OF eliminates all what is non actionable, or future (which goes to OFor OF if must be) and sometime gives me ideas for the future which goes to S or OF.<br><br>In fact its like a tennis game. The tasks goes from OF to SF and it is very fast and easy. <br><br>Then I conciliate Action, thinking and stopped proscratrination. <br><br>Things are just a question of point of view in fact...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2011 at 7:45 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In a conversation outside this forum, I knocked around some ideas with Jupiter and talked about his post above concerning his attempts to combine OmniFocus and SF.  <br><br>I would like to pass some of these on in case someone is struggling with some results of his latest trial-and-error as described in his post, and maybe provide some clarification or other interesting points.<br><br>I have especially been interested in his series of posts because, since I got into SF, I didn’t want to drop OmniFocus completely.  But I wanted to keep it simple somehow, and for it to act as a container for project actions.  I also wanted a place to throw dated (with reminders), contextual (at least a couple) or other items that I didn’t want in the way right now.<br><br>FIRST POINT:  Referring to text below where he starts to discuss “About my method”:<br><br>He basically affirms the original idea that everything goes into SF as it comes to mind.  (I assume he meant in the traditional sense with mixed items.  For project-specific “dumping”, OF could be used.)<br><br>SECOND POINT:  <br>OF will be used for planning, organising and feeding SF.  He stressed that non-actionable and future items can go into SF because SF deals well with them by its own method, i.e., not only weeds out, but also handles future and dismissed well.<br>THIRD POINT<br>SF does the controlling and cleaning with its own natural workflow, and OF does its thing only when inside a project itself (this was the main point).<br>NEXT:  <br>He just elaborated on the above point by saying that non-actionables and futures are easy to pick out in a quick review in SF, and also in OF, but (again) only when actually working on a project in OF.<br><br>As far as doing or expanding on project planning steps, he mentioned that he likes MindMaps (over simply adding steps in OF).<br><br>He mentioned that it was his experience during a review in SF that some tasks for the near-future (2-3 days) stay in SF, and if they are for the “real future”, or someday/maybes, they go into OF.<br><br>By simplifying, he has conciliated action and thinking, and stopped procrastination; that things at any given moment are just a “point of view” at that moment, and therefore things should not be made too complicated.<br><br>His distinction being that OF is for thinking, for putting in the Big Rocks, the most important dated items and the someday/maybes.<br><br>On the other hand, SF is a killer action tool.  It deals with things you really want to do, plus it deals with things you don’t know what to do with.<br><br>He went on to say that currently, he uses the right-hand page for SF’s columns, and the left-hand side for short summary notes.  When he does his daily review, he uses the notes to help decide the relative tasks that need to go into C1 as normal tasks, or into C2 as urgent or unfinished.  <br><br>He got this “short summary notes on the left” from an Inc. Magazine article titled, “The Simplest System”.  In that article, a running (continuous) top-priorities-for-the-day list is kept on the right-hand side, and the summary notes on the left.  Here is the link:  <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html</a><br><br>He referred to OF as his “big elephant”, which collects his life and project details, including historical notes and other references about the project itself.  But mainly, it is a place for the project big rocks, and goals.<br><br>However, SF is his guide (he used the word “stone”), his assistant to help him do things and free his intuition to find the light when he is in the dark, and reveals the “best of his cleverness”. <br><br>But for higher elevations, his opinion is that this is where the mindmap “takes the relay”.  He went on to stress again that SF is about action and decisions, and the rest is for altitude and collection (in order to obtain a sense of freedom).<br><br>For him, the results have been incredible, and he can’t believe it himself.  Besides Mark, he is greatly indebted to D. Allen and Tony Buzan (his mentors).<br><br>These were some highlights of the conversation.  Hope this is useful to somebody.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 May 2011 at 8:18 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm doing pretty much what Jupiter and BKK described as far as the functions of OF and SF. I'm only speaking of personal stuff, not work/job stuff. <br><br>One of the main uses for OF at this point is for recurring maintenance type things and I utilize the repeat/start/due etc. functions of OF. I have just about found the right balance between due dates and start dates (litterbox cleaning requires a hard due date, vacuuming not quite). I use growl to pop up things that become available. One project that has "musts" goes into SF immediately (some things C1, some things C2), the other main maintenance-type project is the type that I'd like to do sometime in the near future, so those things only get popped into SF when I think I'll be doing them within the next few days (cleaning out drawer X in the kitchen). <br><br>I collect everything into SF and most dismissed things move into OF somewhere, usually someday/maybe, at least initially.<br><br>I have some true projects in there too, but since it's the end of the school year they've  been basically stagnant for a bit and will be for the next couple weeks. Through summer, I imagine I'll be utilizing them more and bringing items to work on into SF. <br><br>I agree that SF is my action tool and OF is my planning/higher elevations tool.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 May 2011 at 13:36 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just an enormous many thanks indeed to BKK who summarized perfectly my use of OF and SF and our conversation. As you know English is not my native language and it is not easy to explain what I really thought and tried. So BKK did it perfectly. I just wanted to add that I am just a seeker. I try to do my best and experiment every solution because I have a very hard and busy job with a lot of stuff as a dealmaker. My method did evoluate, is evoluating and will evoluate little by little. It is just my experiment relative to my job. I really hope it will be useful for some of us. Omnifocus is indeed a really good tool. SF too. Yes we can conciliate them easily and it works.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 May 2011 at 16:13 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; English is not my native language ...
