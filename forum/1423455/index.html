Sometimes I left it, but would always go back.   It's more of a notebook format with a few loose rules, but it was very useful.  It had some ideas similar to Mark's "dismissal" rules; it was page-based; some concepts similar to DIT; overall, very simple but quite effective.   I started using it in college, and then used it at work for several years.   It includes a paper-based calendar.   You can see it at plannerpads.com.   One nice thing, it's relatively inexpensive as far as planners go.   It's also simple, and doesn't lend itself to endless reorganizing and tweaking.<br><br>When I started my current job in 2003, it was the first time I used Outlook.  Everyone here uses Outlook for shared calendaring, so it didn't make sense to use my Planner Pad for calendaring any more.   And that took away from its overall usefulness.   So I started trying to find other ways to manage my work -- most of them involving Outlook.   I tried applying Covey-esque techniques and GTD techniques.   I always picked up useful ideas from these systems but could never really stick with them for too long.   Covey had great concepts for doing larger, deeper thinking about one's work and one's purpose, but seemed weak on day-to-day implementation.   GTD had great ideas for getting organized, for capturing everything in one place, for identifying concrete next steps; but I always felt like I was just running on a treadmill of my own creation when I was using it.   And my weekly review always turned into a "what do I really want to do with my life" session, so it wasn't very useful for weekly maintenance of my workload.  LOL<br><br>I started reading about DIT sometime in 2008 - I still can't remember exactly how I ran across it.   The book had some great ideas and concepts that I could immediately put into use.   But I never was really able to distill what the nuts and bolts of the "system" were.   <br><br>While I was trying to figure that out, mainly by spending time on Mark's website, Mark announced his retirement, followed up immediately by his tantalizing accounts of a system that let you work on whatever you wanted, for as long as you wanted, and yet get lots of things done -- the RIGHT things.   And then Autofocus was launched.   I started on it immediately, and stayed with it for about a year (taking short excursions into AF2 and AF4 along the way).<br><br>When Mark released DWM in Feburary 2010, I started on that very quickly, because it promised to address the main issues I was having with AF.   And it worked great.   It was particularly well suited to an Outlook-based implementation.   I kept going with that till the first SF and related AF4 variants were introduced.  I tried those "on the side", in a notebook, while continuing to use DWM in Outlook for project- and context-based tasks.  SF was especially interesting.<br><br>I then started using SFv3 the day it was released and have been using it ever since.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2011 at 1:19 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>Well I had a nice detailed answer; but the square-space post form ate it.
