In Mark's "Dreams" book he was quite big on vision but SF seems often to be discussed as efficient widget-cranking.

I think it is the effect of the total system.<br><br>In GTD, the metaphor is artificial flight: you work up to the 50,000' Life Goals only after clearing your runway of basic, daily work. I never really got the hang of anything above the project level, and I suspect that the beautiful hierarchy of planning levels was a rather artificial construct, bolted on to a practical, intuitive system.<br><br>With SF, the metaphor is a journey through a forest, following an unseen quarry. Your true goal may not be obvious, but it can be inferred from looking at what you have actually done. SF does not claim to help you soar above the forest, but does provide a handy machete to clear the undergrowth off your path.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2011 at 21:19 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>SF is really a ground-level system.  The review of dismissed pages gets you to "10000 ft", but the system doesn't go any higher than that.  <br><br>I think the general idea is that if you want higher level planning, add those planning items into the list itself.  Maybe some things could be scheduled.  Maybe every February 23 you add "50000 ft" into SF.<br><br>However, it never was clear to me in the GTD book what you'd do with that item.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2011 at 22:03 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for contributing Will,<br><br>I tend to agree that the higher view in GTD was more of an add-on, an attempt to reach to the meaning of all the active busyness and return to a "flow" state. It lacks elegance there in my view. SF is more honest there as it makes no claims. <br><br>Perhaps it's that we seek a quality of experience to the activities and encounters. The machete metaphor I think is too aggressive and confrontational for example. I'd prefer a metaphor of being open to placing attention based on what we value - a landscape and lighthouse perhaps. Perhaps each day I will ask "What is the best use of my day?"...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2011 at 22:04 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ah! The distinction I was seeking is perhaps Chronos (physical clock-time) v Kairos (metaphysical quality of the moment). So I want ease, peace and joy to flow (timelessness?) into my relationship to SF - a left brain/right brain arrangement? Heart meeting head?<br><br>Let me lighten things with this amusing take on dismissal:<br><br>"I once read a story about a man who wanted to live life more fully and became more sensitive to the passage of time.  He went around town and bought thousands of marbles.  Each marble represented a day.  When he had collected enough marbles to more than last for the rest of his life, he put them in a large glass container.  Each evening he would take out one marble and throw it as far as he could to the back of his garden.  There were days when he would look at his marble and think how beautiful it was, not wanting to throw it away."<br> (from <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://tinyurl.com/4dpzanv)">http://tinyurl.com/4dpzanv)</a><br><br>I imagine that kind of exercise would bring a certain focus!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2011 at 22:25 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with both Will and Alan that the useful parts of GTD and SF are about how to manage your list of tasks, i.e. the minute-by-minute processing, rather than higher-level abstract considerations of goals, plans, reflections, reviews, etc., which most people will do only occasionally (once daily or less frequently).  If you want a system that emphasizes these abstract activities, Franklin-Covey isn't bad.  But when you get down to actually doing tasks, I would substitute Mark's SuperFocus for F-C's priority-based list method.<br><br>If you just want to insert periodic reminders to do the "higher-altitude" stuff, I highly recommend using your 43-folders tickler file (one of the best "tricks" I ever learned from David Allen). If you get used to using this, it's a lot better than a [paper | electronic] calendar, because it can hold physical papers &amp; cards, and because it's so simple to move the reminder in order to "do it tomorrow" when you know you haven't the time or energy for a periodic review or planning session today.  Each reminder card or sheet of paper can also be used to log the activity; so, when you come to it, you can see instantly when the last time was that you actually did it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2011 at 23:06 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm actually rather puzzled why no one else thinks SF can effectively address these high-level issues.<br><br>Addressing these questions would fall under the category of "discretionary time", I think (unless you specifically delegate such activities to regularly scheduled appointments with your spouse or manager or mentor or pastor or psychotherapist or whatever to work on it).   :-)<br><br>And SF is designed to handle everything in your discretionary time.<br><br>So my conclusion is SF can handle this kind of thing quite well.<br><br>And that conclusion has been validated by experience in using the system, as I wrote recently here:  <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1443971#post1447434">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1443971#post1447434</a><br><br>It's easy to trigger this kind of high-level reflection on the direction of one's life by entering items in the SF list such as:<br><br>- Am I really doing what I want/should/need to be doing with my life?<br><br>- What am I really trying to do?   What is stopping me from doing it?<br><br>- Read "How to make your dreams come true" and do the mind exercises therein<br><br>- What are my 25-year goals?   5-year?    1-year?   How am I tracking toward them?   What is stopping me from achieving them?<br><br>I have found that the more viscerally I phrase these items, the more effective they are.   Sometimes when these kinds of tasks "stand out", I do some mind mapping and start connecting the dots in my life, writing down the things that really trouble me, the things that really seem to be working, etc., and then put any relevant things that need more follow-through back into SF.<br><br>In summary, I suppose you could say I treat this high-level reflection like any other ongoing project -- I have at least one item in SF that prompts me to review the project and see how it's going overall, look for gaps, see how we're tracking towards milestones, etc.; and I also enter anything that can be actioned now, whether it's simple reflection on a particular topic or issue, or reading a book, or discussing something with my wife, or whatever.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2011 at 0:15 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If the GTD 50,000-foot level review is meaningful for you, then why NOT put that as a task in SF?   "Do GTD 50,000-foot review"<br><br>If it gets dismissed then perhaps you need to focus more on the minutiae of life right now; you can re-enter it after you reflect a little on why it got dismissed.  Or maybe rephrase it in a way that is more meaningful to you.    Or spread it out as several tasks.   Or re-read that chapter in David Allen's book to see what it is that you think you need from it.

As I understand it, AF and SF take it as read that we already have goals. These are sometimes obscured by the thicket of everyday tasks. A/S F provide a method of clearing away the tasks which do not relate to our true goals.<br><br>And all of this happens at the "ground level". <br><br>Of course, you can work on your goals. If this work aligns with your true priorities.

A weaving of a "doing" thread and a "being" thread (flow). As being is so much more important than doing I wanted a way to bring it into focus more (!). In "flow" theory the work is only there to create the state of being; the individual feels he or she is merging with the activity. I suppose it might be harmonising oneself with the current activity; the inherent satisfaction of achieving this state of mind on a task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2011 at 9:42 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(simple way to generate a flow state -imagine that you are standing in a river.

Then I would suggest either catching up or focusing on what you can drop. <br><br>Once you are no longer behind on work, goal review might be dropped because it's too big and nebulous. Remember the SF solution to this: Work a little bit at a time.  You don't need to tackle the whole thing, just think for a minute or two, write something, and if you're stuck set it aside.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2011 at 13:03 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan, Michael,<br><br>I suspect that consciously focusing on letting go will have much the same effect as consciously deciding not to think about pink elephants with purple polka dots.<br><br>This feels like more of a "wax on, wax off" thing.

I see this as the place where SF can serve as the method for best (for me) organizing my doing and keep me moving forward. If I write down ALL my thoughts in SF, there will naturally be some higher level thoughts that will get encouraged and move forward with something in the present or dismissed. If you're reviewing your dismissed items in SF, then you will have to reflect on these things and figure out what to do with them. SF just doesn't specify what is to be done with them. That's up to you. <br><br>I think that just as many people 'do GTD' without doing anything at higher levels, many people do SF like that as well. Some people like/need a system that helps them/encourages them to reflect on the bigger picture (GTD altitudes/FC) some do it naturally, some don't do it at all. <br><br>I think the simplicity of SF lets it be a stand-alone 'doing' system or a component in any one of many larger systems that include bigger picture stuff. It's up to the individual to figure out their need.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 March 2011 at 17:23 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF/SF work great for high level planning, without needing a weekend retreat.<br><br>One option is to add "High level planning" to the list as a task. It's a long one, a good candidate for the little-and-often approach.<br><br>Or throw all your possible goals at the list and let it help you decide. Mark has written at length about reviewing tasks that keep getting dismissed. First you investigate why that task keeps getting dismissed, then you take appropriate action. If it still keeps getting dismissed, there's another reason that must be addressed.<br><br>The dismissal part of AF/SF is the key here. Anything that shouldn't be a true goal gets removed. All that remain are goals you will make progress on.<br><br>Under Covey and GTD, undone tasks and goals hang around until the next high-level review, not getting done and clogging up the page. GTD tells you to unblock them by deciding a next action, which often works, but doesn't help if the real problem is it's not a good goal. Covey suggests you put one task for each goal on your list each week, but doesn't say what to do if the same task isn't done each week.<br><br>Michael: I like your Flow State list.
