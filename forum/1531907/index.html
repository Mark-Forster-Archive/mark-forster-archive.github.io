Specifically they are excellent at taking you through your stuff and getting stuff done.  Specifically they do NOT help you think through what stuff you're doing.  <br><br>I believe there is a point where you need to think over what roles and activities constitute your living, to make decisions about what you want to emphasize and what you want to diminish.<br><br>Top-down systems like Covey's 7 habits, and Forster's Dreams help you define such.  Just thinking about life broadly helps.  Auto-Foci help indirectly.  As David Allen says, it's hard to make realistic top-down decisions when you're drowning in the day to day problems.  (I think he's much better at describing the situation than codifying the solution.)  Having today under control makes it easier to step back and think about the rest.<br><br>Which step I think is very important.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2011 at 14:21 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2008/2/21/project-management.html">http://www.markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2008/2/21/project-management.html</a> applies to AF/SF just as much as to DIT.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2011 at 16:35 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have a daily yoga exercise that I do each morning. It's 15 minutes of low-level stretches to help me wake up and it ends in 2 minutes of meditation. I take those two minutes to dip into "Dreams". (I find that living my entire day in "Dreams" mode doesn't work for me.) Those two minutes of meditation set my frame of mind and guide my intuition throughout the rest of the day as I work my SF list. Having read "Dreams" and having used SF, I have always considered them to be complimentary.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2011 at 16:41 | jFenter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>jFenter - <br><br>Interesting. I abandoned to-do lists for appx 3 weeks, but after booking a client for two similar spots, I realized I need some form of capture/to-do list. I'll be using evernote, and keeping it very simple. <br><br>I'm still having difficulty drifting into drift mode. Another difficulty is keeping the exercises fresh. It would be interesting to know if I'm drifting more/less since using Dreams. Anway, since using Dreams, I'm drawing more. That's enough evidence to keep dong the exercises.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2011 at 16:53 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum: I think as soon as your work involves responsibility in connecting with other people (employees, customers, bosses),something is needed to manage this stuff.  I don't see high-level thinking as meeting that. <br><br>Mark: Would you include "Think about what's on my AF list (and whether it's the right stuff)" as a something that fits that blog post's suggestion?  Or "Consider where I want to go in life", or "Rewrite my future vision"?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2011 at 17:07 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I asked Mark how lists fit into Dreams in another thread.

"Think about roles &amp; goals".   "What do you really want to do?"    "Take time to think about the big picture" etc.<br><br>Usually I would pass over these tasks because SF (still) tends to bring my attention to things I can get done quickly.<br><br>But over time, those larger high-level kinds of things would still be percolating in the background.   Eventually they would assert themselves -- but usually off-list.   I'd suddenly just start blasting away and work out all my big-picture worries in a 3-hour mind-mapping session.<br><br>I've been thinking more about this and why it happens that way.   As a result, I've started working in a way that combines a Dreams-ish approach (without the future-self dialogs, which I just can't get myself to do) with frequent dives into my SF book to make sure I'm not forgetting any details.  <br><br>So, I agree with Alan, each approach has its strengths and weaknesses.   And like JFenter said, I'm finding the two approaches to be complementary.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2011 at 18:20 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think it's important to be clear which method you are actually using, otherwise confusion is going to result.<br><br>If you are working "Dreams" then you are obviously going to need the tools to do the job. You wouldn't expect your vision to pull you to work by floating effortlessly through the air. You would need the car, train, bus, bike, shoe leather just like all those people in Push Mode do. In just the same way, you need project documentation, lists of outstanding actions and all the rest. <br><br>If you are working AF/SF/DIT or whatever, then you certainly need to consider your vision and your aims. Reviews should be regularly scheduled.<br><br>My concern is that you should be clear which you are doing : Dreams or AF/SF/DIT. They are two separate ways of approaching work and life. The resulting behaviour may overlap, but it's important to know which is in the lead.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2011 at 23:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Excellent. You probably made these points several times before, but this is the first I've clearly discerned the big Picture. One should have a clearly decided director. Speaking metaphorically, I tend to think Autofocus makes a poor CEO, but an excellent Executive Assistant.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 June 2011 at 0:47 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I suppose it's a matter of style. I see Superfocus as a soft method which aims to allow your true goals to emerge from your subconscious via the choices it makes from day to day. And I love the fact that it hides in plain sight, masquerading as a to do list. It does just fine as a CEO, so long as it doesn't forget to engage the VP of Strategy.<br><br>Still got to read Dreams.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 June 2011 at 9:19 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan/Will:<br><br>AF/SF is designed to manage your actions in the context of your life. That means that every action that you do can be managed through the system. Planning, strategizing, working on vision, researching, documenting, brainstorming, theorizing are all actions carried out by you and therefore can be managed by AF/SF.<br><br>What it doesn't do though is tell you HOW to do these things - and I think this is where the confusion comes. If you have a task "Plan Project X", it doesn't tell you how to plan it, any more than "Cycle to Work" tells you how to ride a bicycle.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 June 2011 at 13:29 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree.  I'm trying to highlight one kind of task which should ideally be in everyone's life, yet which won't automatically get there by doing AutoFocus.  Becoming proactive about life and planning life itself -- these do not arise automatically.  Every other task is something that comes up in the course of living.  <br><br>I must make the decision to insert these tasks.  If I don't act on these, I will be paddling about without compass or map.<br><br>Again, I don't mean "Plan Project X", I mean "Think about life".  I understand it can easily be added to AF/SF.  I'm saying it's invaluable to do so, and a critical lack if it's not done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 June 2011 at 14:08 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Shame on you Mark: you promised not to talk about the Infernal Velocipede any more!<br><br>I think I'll carry on with SF to avoid the risk of getting confused. I may even get round to thinking about where I want to be in a few years. But even without such overt effort, SF  DOES seem to provide a compass, (if not a guide book to the destination). <br><br>Your Map May Vary.<br><br>:o)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 June 2011 at 15:46 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>You could actually add the type of thinking and planning to AF with entries like consider life goals, drop activity A, add activity B.  It can also be used to track things in other plans by "sending" you into a project plan or some other system that is handling another aspect of your life.  <br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 June 2011 at 23:45 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I mean "Think about life". &gt;&gt;<br><br>My original concept for AutoFocus, which is why it got the name, is that given a simple structure like AF to work with one's mind would gradually focus on the things which were really important to it and jettison those that weren't.<br><br>So rather than "Think about life", the concept was "Work at life" or even "Work with life".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2011 at 9:46 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's an incredible conception there; seriously fascinating !<br><br>Do you feel that practice has born out the idea in reality?  Anybody?  I feel it like it could happen gradually over time but much less directly than a deliberate process of reflection.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2011 at 12:57 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>No, I don't think it worked as well as I hoped it would. But I still think there's huge mileage in letting things emerge of their own accord. A good exercise is to look back over the last 10-15 years and identify what the themes are that have emerged in your life over that period. These themes are likely to continue to manifest themselves in the future.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2011 at 15:19 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Perhaps AutoFocuses can get you there given the right attitude.  Idea: Using AF keeps you feeling work is plausibly managed.  To go beyond this, adopt a mindset where you become more aware of how you feel, as you see and select the tasks AF presents to you.  Use these feelings to direct you to invent other tasks that lead to better satisfaction.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 July 2011 at 0:55 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
