I've found a lot of fascinating ideas, though I don't think any of it is quite what I was looking for.<br><br>So -- of course -- I'm now developing a system of my own!  (Isn't that par for the course around here?)  I started out trying to follow SuperFocus, but it just didn't feel right to me.  I really liked nuntym's Context Autofocus (CAF) system, but it still didn't feel quite right either.  Also, using 3x5 index cards instead of a notebook appeals to me for some reason, so I decided to devise my own Autofocus variant based on index cards instead of a notebook.<br><br>My system is still being developed, and I don't have a good name for it, but I'm trying to combine AF1 and AF2 with contexts in a different way than CAF, while utilizing GTD "next actions" as well.  I'm currently trying to incorporate the 3T system to increase focus on finishing while trying to maintain the flexibility of AF1.  (I'm not just feeding everything through 3T like AF4-3T does.)  I'm not ready to post the rules just yet, but I intend to later.<br><br>Does anyone else have a preference for using index cards, or is it just me?<br><br>Deven</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2011 at 19:38 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Welcome, Deven.  I don't recall anyone here being a fan of index cards.  I've thought about it, but it seems less portable.  Experience suggests an Autofocus system would have about 100 tasks, which makes for 100 cards.  If you do proceed with cards, it seems to me AF4 is the easiest to map over because it is two simple lists, compared to others which call for multiple pages.<br><br>Good luck!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2011 at 19:59 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A year or two ago, I read David Allen's book and tried to implement a GTD system using index cards.  Using one task per card, it was a large stack indeed, but it seemed workable.  The problem I found was that I couldn't block out the time for the weekly review process, and without it, the whole system fell apart in a month or two.<br><br>As for portability, see Merlin Mann's "Hipster PDA" page -- a stack of index cards with a binder clip is just as portable as a small notebook is:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda">http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda</a><br><br>This time, I'm not using one task per card, but rather one context per card and 1-2 lines per task.  I'm leaning towards Mark Forster's ideas in general, while keeping some of David Allen's ideas in mind at the same time.<br><br>Being an Autofocus variant, my system retains the universal capture simplicity of AF1, but the processing rules require GTD-style "next actions" in a useful yet unobtrusive way.  My system maintains a focus on urgent tasks that AF1 lacks, and an awareness of context without going overboard with it as GTD can.  I'm using a continuous review process to avoid the weekly review process that GTD uses, which I found to be a fatal flaw for me.<br><br>Finally, I devised my own dismissal/review process that feels more natural, and I think it will meet the Autofocus goals of automatic intuitive filtering without being arbitrary or causing stress that something that was dismissed really shouldn't have been.  I'm flagging urgent and important tasks and incorporating that information into the processing and dismissal rules.  (I'm toying with the idea of flagging unfinished, but I think integrating 3-T into the processing may provide a sufficient focus on finishing without overemphasizing it.)<br><br>However, many of the decisions I made have been based more on my own speculation and influenced by Mark's blog postings, his own reviews of his systems, and the discussion forums on this site.  What I don't have is a baseline of real-world experience with using my system, so I'll have to report back later how well it's working in practice.  I'm interested in finding others who would like to give it a try, but I'm hesitant to post the rules yet, since it may still be too much in flux...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2011 at 20:29 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To be clear, I do treat each card as a "page" in Autofocus terms.  These index cards have only 10 lines on them, not counting the "title" area.  Obviously this is a far cry from the 25-35 lines that Mark recommends for AF1, but my dismissal rules are different, so I don't expect this to be a problem.  In fact, it feels like an advantage to narrow the closed lists down to 10 items or less, but I'll have a better feel for it after I've worked the system longer.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2011 at 20:41 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Deven,<br>I'm interested in any reports of your ongoing trials.

Cards in the Urgent stack (i.e. with at least one urgent task) are processed AF2-style, while cards in the Active stack (i.e. with no urgent tasks) are processed AF1-style.  The "standing out" principle applies; my system never tries to force anything.   I have dismissal rules too, but I haven't gotten to the point of using them yet.  I'm currently experiment with incorporating 3T into the system, but unsure how to do that without disrupting the processing flow.<br><br>My goal is to maintain the simple universal capture, rational/intuitive balance, comfortable processing flow and low resistance of AF1, while incorporating the effectiveness of AF2 for handling urgent tasks, the efficiency of context awareness and next actions from GTD and hopefully the effectiveness of 3T for finishing tasks as well.<br><br>Any thoughts/feedback/ideas?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 December 2011 at 15:00 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In my experience it's very tricky to design an AF solution that works smoothly.

It wasn't bad, and it did allow for easy sequencing of tasks, but it took a lot of cards.  In the end, GTD didn't work for me because I couldn't keep up with the required weekly reviews, but David Allen has good ideas.<br><br>For my current system, I am putting multiple tasks on each card, using 1-2 lines per task.  I am using GTD-style "next actions" because I do believe that uncertainty about where to start is a source of resistance.  However, to maintain the ease of universal capture, I don't require next actions on initial entry.<br><br>Re-entered tasks do require a next action, unless the task itself qualifies as a next action because it's obvious how to start.  (e.g. "call Mom")  When I have a next action for a task, it is always written on the next line, with an arrow from the previous line.  (I draw an L-shaped arrow to indicate it derives from the task above.)<br><br>I do have context labels on each card, although my system could easily be used without contexts.  The default context is a catch-all category, used for universal capture and anything that doesn't really need to be categorized.  Depending on which instance of the system I'm using, I have "Work" or "Personal" as the default context.  (I initially used "New" but that made it difficult to tell the stacks apart when clipped together.)<br><br>I'm at a loss for a good name for my system.  I like the "Context Autofocus" name, but I wouldn't want anyone to confuse my system with nuntym's system, though my system is indeed derived from his.  I thought about calling it "Hipster Autofocus" after the "Hipster PDA" name, but I really hate that name.  I could call it "Index Autofocus" because it's based on index cards.  I'm not sure -- does anyone have good suggestions for a name?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 December 2011 at 14:39 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've used index cards in the past for various things, including writing papers, autofocus, Big Three list for today, etc. I think it's best to keep only one narrowly-focused topic on each card, because the great thing about index cards is that they aren't connected. They can be spread out and shuffled into any order that makes sense at the moment. They can also be segregated into contexts or other categories. So if you use them for tasks, you can decide which ones are useful to carry around for a given period of time (but you must always have a few blank ones and a pen).

The cards function as a page does in AF1 (albeit smaller), and provides the benefits of a series of closed lists.

Or "Waiting" for things where followup is the only action I can take.<br><br>The idea behind broad contexts is not to get wrapped up in categorizing tasks, but to provide some basic organization for better efficiency.  The purpose of the context is to keep related items together so you don't have to go searching for them when the time comes, to group items with a high context switch overhead, and in the case where the context is inappropriate to the current situation (e.g. "Errands" while sitting at my desk at work), allow the entire context to be skipped until later.<br><br>&lt;&lt; Would a project or list ever count as a context for you? Or do you ever use cards that way?  Such as all steps for print project or everything to pack for a trip. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, a project or list can count as a context.  For example, I made a context for Christmas for holiday-related tasks -- decorating, shopping, wrapping, etc.  Where you draw the line is entirely up to you; only use contexts that make things easier, not harder.  I don't assign a context for most of my work projects, but I do assign one for a certain subset of my tasks of related work that require a different mode of thinking.  When in doubt, DON'T create a new context, because overcategorization is a danger in itself.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 December 2011 at 16:25 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Note that I have a generic default context ("Work" or "Personal", depending on the instance of my system) that I use for universal capture of new tasks, although initial entry onto a card with a specific context is also allowed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 December 2011 at 17:28 | Deven</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
