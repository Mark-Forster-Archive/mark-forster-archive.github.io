GTD differs in producing "next actions" list (Mark does not limit how granular task should be) and has many more layers/processes but the fundamental one when dealing with actual work is the same: scanning the appropriate list and looking for what intuitively stands out. It never occurred to me before. <br><br>The fact that two great minds came to similar conclusions independently underlines for me the importance of this mechanism.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2017 at 21:40 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Daneb:<br><br>&lt;&lt; the fundamental one when dealing with actual work is the same: scanning the appropriate list and looking for what intuitively stands out.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Was that in the original edition?

Some of the tools &amp; techniques – such as Collection of all 'stuff' (into a single Inbox), maintaining general Reference files, employing a 43-folder Tickler file (for deferred action), keeping a Waiting-For list, etc. – are quite useful and compatible with Mark's methods.  And you could use, e.g., Mark's RA approach both to process Next Actions and to fill your Inbox with new and recurring Tasks &amp; Ideas.<br><br>However, the strictness of GTD – e.g. having to define a Project for every Task that encompasses more than a single Next Action, doing Weekly Reviews according to the instructions, etc. – became overwhelming and just not fun to stick to, at least for me.  I've kept the useful tools &amp; some of the GTD philosophy, however.  <br><br>IIRC, processing your list of Next Actions in GTD wasn't supposed to include skipping over things that don't "stand out" unless there's a really good reason, such as being in the wrong Context.  And I don't think David Allen emphasizes the "little and often" approach like Mark does.<br><br>Here's a pretty good graphic summarizing the GTD approach:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.brevedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The_Concepts_Of_GTD.png">http://www.brevedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The_Concepts_Of_GTD.png</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2017 at 17:35 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I used to use GTD. I would get everything organized into Projects, and create Next Actions in the appropriate @Context lists.  The problem was in the "Do" stage.  The problem of course is resistance, not necessarily how you organize the tasks.  Mark mentioned in his latest experiment "I experienced no resistance" so I'm looking forward to buying the ebook.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2017 at 18:08 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I found my copy of the GTD book, and it's actually worse than I thought. For day-to-day action-list decisions, David Allen (DA) suggests a four-criteria model (Chapter 9).  So before you decide to do anything, you need to filter and sort your list!  Here are some objections to these criteria:<br><br>1. Context. DA makes a big deal about this, and it often doesn't make sense in the modern world - e.g. I can communicate via text, email, and phone just about any time of the day, whether I'm in the office or commuting or at home.  @computer, @phone, etc. seem like anachronisms.<br><br>2. Time Available. Mark's little-and-often approach means that I can get a good start on a large project or task, even when I only have a few minutes before the next meeting.<br><br>3. Energy Available. Likewise, I don't need to have a lot of mental or physical energy to start tackling a big task. Simply writing down a question or sending an email can keep the ball rolling on an important project. Then I can cross off (and reenter) that task and move on to something else, or even take a break if I'm feeling exhausted.<br><br>4. Priority. Mark and others have written extensively on why prioritization is often a fool's errand. For me the main thing is that priorities often change - assigning &amp; tracking them adds a lot of overhead to actually getting things done!  In further discussion later in the chapter, DA elaborates with a threefold model for evaluating daily work, and a six-level model for reviewing.  Can you feel the weight of all this structure?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2017 at 19:32 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; Can you feel the weight of all this structure? &gt;&gt;<br><br>My blood pressure is going up just reading your post!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2017 at 20:03 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br>I am not sure about the wording in original edition. Of course, Allen does not use name "standing out", but "intuition". His notion is somehow similar, the main difference being that you only consider context-appropriate list for the intuitive scanning:<br><br>"There will always be a long list of actions that you are not doing at any given moment. So how will you decide what to do and what not to do, and feel good about both?<br>The answer is, by trusting your intuition. If you have captured, clarified, organized, and reflected on all your current commitments, you can galvanize your intuitive judgment with some intelligent and practical thinking about your work and values.” <br><br>“This is where you need to access your intuition and begin to rely on your judgment call in the moment.”</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2017 at 22:10 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ubi:<br><br>I would be the last to overly defend GTD but still I think that you did not get the criteria (and  quit right. When Allen speaks about these four layers, in fact he shows them as mental guides for intuitive decision. He says: Being in appropriate context (using this context list) you consider your time available, your energy and priority (=value) of all the tasks in the list at the moment and using these guides you intuitively choose your next action. <br><br>You described these criteria in the fashion many other GTD fans described it on blogs. (It is misunderstanding of how it is described in the book - now I have it freshly in mind). Sometimes GTD community show "GTD systems" where they label necessary energy level for the task using tags, they write down time needed for the task, they mark priority using ABC etc. There are deviations and overcomplications from the original system. In original GTD, priority, time available etc. are not stable/explicit (possible to write down) but dynamic and changing. Maybe better said: they are not task attributes but attributes of the moment (you/your energy/mood+tasks+situation)<br><br>These four criteria are meant more like automatic/semiconscious guides helping with the correct choice. In fact, they must be involved in every good intuitive decision - irrespective of if you use AF or FV or GTD - it is not good decision to choose a task when you are not in good context for it, you do not have enough time, your energy/mood is totally inappropriate etc.<br><br>If I may, I would maybe suggest for you to read the whole  book again (as I did) or maybe the new edition which is of course improved. You could be surprised as I am now. I softened some of my GTD hard critic and I surprisingly found out that what I criticised most was never in the book (original edition) but usually was "common interpretation" by GTD community or my own gradual hacking of the system and gradual changing in understanding the rules and principles in my mind (which i did not noticed), without referencing the original source for many years.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2017 at 22:31 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>What it says on the diagram which ubi mentions above is:<br><br>5. _Do_ your actions using your lists and files and these processes: <br>Choose actions based on context, time available, energy available and priority.<br>Process unexpected items. Define your work by processing your inbox.<br>Set long term (3-5) years, mid-term (1-2 years) and short time priorities in your areas of responsibility, your current projects and your current actions.<br><br>Whatever he says about using intuition, this seems a far cry from "Do what stands out ".<br><br>I could never personally work this way (and I did try it once). But I'm sure it suits some people, probably many people, so I've no wish to decry his work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2017 at 22:49 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Covey's 7 Habits and his First Things First were the first time management books I read. (I don't count one Dad got at a seminar his office made everyone attend. That book had ways to do things faster, including multi-tasking.)<br><br>GTD was the second. The systems balanced each other.<br><br>For years, I thought GTD's weekly brain dump was a waste of time. You should already have all that on your master list! Then I looked at what I actually do. I am most comfortable when I do a weekly review of my master list and all open projects, and include a brain dump. When I'm not on track, which is more often than I'd like, the weekly brain dump gives me confidence and helps me focus.<br><br>The Next Action idea was revolutionary for me. Even if I don't write it explicitly, I think about it when I put the project on my list. (Often, the NA is "list steps and pick an NA.") I also use it with the family. If my kids promise to do something, but stall when I ask them what they'll do next, I know they haven't actually committed to it.<br><br>I'm not strict about 2 or more tasks is a project, but the concept of project vs task is important. I usually budget time by project, not task.<br><br>I don't use the 2-minute rule, since it encourages me to do too many quick but unimportant tasks, but trying it made me think about the overhead of putting a task into the system rather than doing it, and also of the overhead of having it in the system. How long does scanning through dozens of less-urgent tasks take, done day after day? Can (or should) the system be changed to reduce that overhead, or should I do more immediately?<br><br>A folder for each contact is another idea, but one I struggle to put into action. I'm good about it for groups, but I never remember to take the folder with me when visiting relatives! (I now scan and email, or put it in the paper mail, or telephone, right away.)<br><br>Does GTD include a way to see if you're doing enough on each project? As I remember it, there are lists for each context (or master list sorted by context). Wherever you are, whatever your energy, you can make the best use of that time. What I don't remember is early warning if you need to spend more time in a context. Making good use of my time in the office, downtown, and while commuting, won't do me any good if my lawn needs to be mowed.<br><br>The ideas of context, location, and energy level are all useful. If I'm resisting something, or if something isn't getting done even though I don't think I'm resisting it, those are usually the reasons. I might need to spend more time downtown running errands, or accept that I won't have the energy to keep all my plates spinning as planned -- and therefore have to change my plans.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2017 at 23:22 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cricket:<br><br>All this is exactly what I'm trying to get away from.

I've had trouble also with Covey's Roles &amp; Goals etc.  I prefer Scott Adams' ideas about systems-focus and talent-stacking beating goals &amp; planning.

And I now recall getting a lot out of the early chapters which outlined the GTD approach. The later chapters in Parts 2 &amp; 3 were more of a slog.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2017 at 23:56 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David Allen seemed revolutionary at the time, replacing the old approach of scheduling and planning and microorganizing with a very attractive philosophy of flexibility and always being ready. It was extremely attractive and air tried for years to make it work and was never satisfied.  The system never really concealed in practice. <br><br>Now I'm trying Mark's approach for years and am never fully satisfied:). But overall I much prefer the no-fuss just write-and-do for 90% of things.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2017 at 23:59 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ubi:<br><br>I will comment on your recent comment later, just one more idea to your previous remark:<br>You stated <br><br>&gt;&gt;And I don't think David Allen emphasizes the "little and often" approach like Mark does.&lt;&lt;<br><br>He actually does, by design of GTD. The cornerstone is "next action", which is defined as "next viable, physical step towards completion of the task/project." You have lists of next actions and choose from them. This is little and often. Because usually next action is little (much less granular than Mark's task), so it will be also done more often. <br><br>I again see quite a similar approach here, with Mark saying something like: Based on a task which you wrote down and selected, decide on "next step" on the spot, in your mind and work as long as you need/feel like. Whereas Allen says: define next step before and write it down. But he does not prescribe that you have to stop there or that you must have exactly that step as you defined it before. These are just aids for decision - you do not have to make so many decisions (defining tasks/next steps itself), just focus on choosing. Which is something in accord with cognitive theories (e.g. Baumeister - on ego depletion or decision paralysis) - with lower cognitive load your decisions will be of higher quality. I am not advocating this approach, just explaining.<br><br>So these are differences. But both is little and often.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 November 2017 at 14:33 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>The diagram you cited is NOT essence of GTD, also it is the best known information about GTD. In similar way so often cited Maslow's hierarchy of needs is not his psychology and Covey's four quadrants are just 5% of First things first principles. Problem is that these three symbols overcame the original books/approaches and thus distracted the understanding of the principles<br><br>Of course, it is because they are quite complicated in comparison with your approaches, however - they also try to usually master broader area than only task management - e.g complex life management, communication, values, ethics (Covey), project management (Allen) , so often the complications might be justified.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 November 2017 at 14:39 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So I decided for an experiment: after reading GTD book (new edition) that I will try to follow the methodology in pure form, as described in the book. No hacking, no complicated additions, no reductions. And I will try as it will go. Because in history, I started to hack GTD from the beginning, which is something what we know is not the best approach (also with Mark's methods).<br><br>I will inform you how it goes. (Hopefully I will find next action "write about GTD experiment on mark's blog" amongst other next actions :-) We will see.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 November 2017 at 14:43 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Daneb,<br><br>Good luck with your experiment. I would appreciate any insights or comments you have about differences between the new and original editions of _Getting Things Done_. <br><br>While I stated above that I regard GTD as more of a complete system than most of Mark's systems, what stopped me from using a more-or-less pure GTD approach was a combination of the lack of a specific implementation strategy (at the time) for following it, and the excessive overhead (as I experienced it) in maintaining numerous Project lists and the necessary Weekly Reviews. I did invest in Things.app (Mac &amp; iOS), but abandoned that approach eventually.<br><br>Looking forward to your next update!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 November 2017 at 18:47 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One more thing to consider.  If we regard the catch-all nature of entries added to any of Mark's various list-based systems as DA's "stuff" - raw unexamined inputs that should be Collected and then Processed then Organized, before forming any sort of Next Action, this immediately raises two issues:<br><br>1. Are we short-circuiting the process by trying to work on such tasks (so as seemingly to make progress and cross it off)?<br><br>2. If we are doing GTD and working mainly from a list of potential Next Actions (NAs), are we permitted to enter or reenter more NAs without going through Collection and Processing and Organizing steps?  Must we put the (re)entry back into our InTray, or can we append directly to the NA list or Project list etc.?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 November 2017 at 19:00 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ubi,<br><br>Most of the time, the InTray will be faster. It's used often enough to be a habit. Leave the processing for later, and get back to the current project.<br><br>If the correct list is already in front of you and open, then it's faster to skip the InTray, unless it might need further processing. With practice, it's very quick to ask "Do I know the NA?" If you don't, then it needs further processing. ("Buy tires" might, when processed, have an NA of "ask Bob what store he used @office" rather than "go to tire store @errands".)<br><br>If you have a meeting this afternoon, don't wait for tomorrow's processing time to put it on the list for the meeting. If you need to get coffee for the meeting, definitely don't put it through the InTray!<br><br>It also depends how often you process the InTray. If you process it often, you can put more in it. If you only process it on Mondays, then anything that needs to be dealt with sooner cannot go through it. Sometimes I divide my InTray into things that can wait until a formal Processing time, and things that must be processed sooner.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 November 2017 at 17:25 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I perfectly know and used GTD regularly for over 11 years... But I must admit it really never worked with me. I agree with Don R when he said "I used to use GTD. I would get everything organized into Projects, and create Next Actions in the appropriate @Context lists. The problem was in the "Do" stage. The problem of course is resistance, not necessarily how you organize the tasks"<br><br>My experience is that GTD is a good system for some if they are in a process system. But I find it indeed complicated and over in my case. <br><br>With GTD I spent too much time structuring instead of acting. The basic idea of willing collecting everything is an illusion. What matters is acting and doing things when they needs beeing done. Reading essentialism from greg mc keown let me realized many things. <br><br>More of all I dont think that putting things in a case is the best way of doing things. I dont also thing that willing of making a perfect organization is the good way to do things. There is a law of the universe wich let me thing that caos doesnt really exist. At a certain point in front of a big messy list wich me seems overwhelming our brain find the path to do what must be at the right time. <br><br>I dont say that plans and structuration is useless. I just say that too much planning and organization leads to desaster for some of use because our way of thinking is special and different from others. Not better but different. <br><br>Now I only list every thing in a A5 note book. I dont care about project context and so on. Then I review the list and focus on one item only then I do what is in my mind one by one. The only thing I try to do is putting a time on it. Do I have to do it now ? Later ? Is it worth to do it ? <br><br>My long list is just a guidline. For projects and complicated things I put extensive notes in a paper folder. <br><br>I also dont use any digital sytems as Omnifocus as I did because I pent too much time on it for bad results. <br><br>No I focus on what seems to be relevant right now and I forget the rest. <br><br>There is no structure, no technical process nothing but my focus on what I do right now. <br><br>Paradoxaly my results are better and I feel less stressed. I know all is collected in my list and it doesn't need any complicated system to set up. <br><br>After all my threads you may think that it is a bit special, may be foolish but I let it go like that for a while observing what happens. If It fell I will correct the system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 November 2017 at 20:41 | Jupiter123@wanadoo.fr</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 day...

No reviewing, just plough straight through.<br>Inevitably there will be a large chunk of time now and again that will need to be spent on a project like you say, so if that feels more urgent than anything else I schedule it in by making a diary note so I don't forget. That is fine, I suppose you could view the project like going on holiday, put out of office on and everything has to wait until you are back. i.e. Block out your time to do the project and everything else has to wait.<br>Alternatively on complicated projects I prefer to do a bit of it at a time. Do 1-2 hours a day for a few weeks and good progress will be made.<br><br>Also on backlogs I have a bit of a post backlog at the moment.

The basic principle is to collect all what is in your mind e.g it is suppose tout get you to mind like water. Ok but no. The brain (mine surely) see it as an obligation to do stuff. "as you collected it you must do it !" Clarify organising gives a kind of structure. On another hand it stucks intuition and leads to confusion due to overwhelming information wich like waves submerges you little by little.This is the same result with long list at one time it become confusing because of the mixt up of present, future tasks and backlogs and also because all projects tasks are mixtes everywhere...<br><br>So what is the solution ? The real question comes from essentialism from Mc Keods. <br>Tasks have to be selected. choices must be taken. The key is focusing on core stuff according to yours priorities. So yours lists are just a burden. A kind of warehouse were only 1% of information are really worth to do. <br><br>If you tune your mind on acting as you do instead of organising, if you separates real information of unusefull informations in the same system, if you plan and do things but also take time to think and apply mc keods principles life becomes suddently clearest. <br><br>For myself I tuned my brain to accept that 99% of informations has no interest. And I try to let it think outside the box.<br><br>GTD, OF, MF systems are just systems. But they are crucial. They are tools made to help you doing stuff but first at all for choosing stuff. <br><br>Today with internet, meetings and solicitations of everywhere people doesnt have time to think. I believe that the system is made to avoid people to think. To stay productive. Remember the shadoks... We are like the shadoks we do 99% of things wich havent no utility for noone. We spend hours running everywhere like ducks without head. But when we realise that we change ourselfs, we let place to intuition and acting is one of the key laws of life. Things happens when we act. The main difference between people or organisation is on what we act !</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 November 2017 at 18:12 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You open email to work on it every day. I used to, and may go back to that method, but for now i'm using fewer and longer time blocks each day. I only do email once or twice a week (plus daily triage). So far, i like it. Most of the work I get through email can (and often should) wait that long. Knowing I need to get through it all today (so I can focus on other things tomorrow) keeps me focused, and more likely to say "interesting, but not worth my time". <br><br>I like the concept of going on holiday when have a big project. I don't go to that extreme, but I will sometimes drop things temporarily so I can work on an urgent, important project.<br><br>For backlogs such as email, I like the 10% method, although it seems unpopular here. Start with a closed list, one that does not get added to. Do 10% of the backlog each session. Round up. At first, you'll do many easy ones each session (delete all the weekly flyers). By the end, you'll do just a few harder ones. Optional: Always do the oldest, or one of the oldest, and any related items. Optional: Record and graph number left at end of each session. Watch lines go down.<br><br>Interesting how some people get discouraged by writing everything down, and others feel freer.

Mark talked often about this, albeit with other terms. Gtd by it's nature should only have dos.   It's too much overhead if you are managing all the maybes as well.

Lists of every maydo get too long to be useful. My lists are about 3/4 do, and 1/4 maydo. Very roughly. Writing things on the list stops them from distracting me, so the threshold is low. Writing it down commits me to think about it again, nothing more. However, I rarely actively look for more things to write.<br><br>The only exception I can think of to not looking for more things to write is when I'm planning a long project. Listing each step gives me a more-accurate time estimate. Accurate time estimates keep me from over-committing.<br><br>I tried a few "deep clean your house" lists. They didn't work. Most things needed to be done more (or less) often than the list said. Now I spend 15 minutes most days, doing what stands out. If nothing stands out, I roll a die to see which room, then ask "What annoyed me recently?" Something stands out pretty quickly! Over the years, I've found that 15 minutes most days gets everything done every few years, and things that get attention more often get it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 November 2017 at 4:13 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Perhaps the distinction between dos and maybe-dos is an illusion.
