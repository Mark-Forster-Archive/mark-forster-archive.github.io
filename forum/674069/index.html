Just a word of warning - if anyone is tempted to try the IE8 Beta Don't!!!  If you do and then try to uninstall it you can't go back.  I ended up with a screen showing just the wallpaper - no icons, no task bar, no start button, no nuffink!  The only option was to reinstall IE8 but suffice it to say doing that with nothing on the screen except a picture of a flower was a challenge!  You have been warned..... :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 20:51 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Looks fine w/XP and Firefox. Also, on my Linux netbook w/Firefox again, it is fine.

(Although I use Firefox as a rule, I like to review developments with IE, but this beta stopped Napster from working so it was a problem.)<br><br>This is a good time for me to appeal for the layout of this page to be adjusted. When reading the forum on a PDA, I have to scroll past all the links on the left hand column first. Then for some reason the right-hand column, and then the posts come into view. I have no idea why it happens in that order but if there were a tweak which made the posts come first on a Windows Mobile PDA it would improve the experience.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 6:01 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark<br><br>Coincidentally, and probably unrelated to the above, the Discussion Forum pages are becoming increasingly unpredictable in load time, and the Twitter Grade button does not always load.  Is it that SquareSpace are doing some site adjustment or could it be that the Twitter Button is somehow impacting the page?

However the pages look fine to me, and load fast. Even the Twitter Grade badge loads immediately.<br><br>I normally use Firefox, but I've tried it out on Safari and Google Chrome and it still works fine. I even opened IE7 (something I'm normally very reluctant to do) and it loaded the Forum with no fuss whatsoever (must be the only page it does!)<br><br>I should also mention that I keep my computer fully updated with the latest Windows updates (XP).<br><br>The only thing I can do is draw the attention of the Squarespace staff to this discussion.

It is disconcerting to have your computer stop working when you really need it.  I have it download the updates but allow me to choose if and when to apply them.  I only do so when I can afford a sleigh ride ;-)<br><br>As to browser, don't even install IE7, if you can avoid it.  There are uninstall issues around that one as well.  I forget what they are as I had already installed it so just gave up on the idea of doing whatever I had planned.<br><br>Echo the IE8 problem ... just say no ;-)<br><br>I use FireFox with no trouble.  They update it frequently and the plugins I use are updated even more frequently.  The only delay is a notice giving me the choice to install them before FireFox comes up and then it takes about one minute longer, less usually.  Easy peasy.<br><br>As to the look of the site ... looks fine to me.  I was put off by the scrolling at first.  My druthers would be to have the latest posts first, but then I realized I could hit the "end" key and start from the bottom, which is the same then.  Then the "home" key to get me to the top so I could go back to the home page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 20:30 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike<br><br>A big THANK YOU for the "End" key tip - didn't know that!  Fantastic!<br><br>The IE7 problem was the same as the IE8 and occurred with the IE7 Beta if you wanted to go back to IE6.  The fact is that any IE installation seems to do weird and wonderful Microsofty things to miscellaneous .dlll files and all of the usual tricks to correct it just don't work - including Microsoft's own rollback options!

And he saw that it was good."  ROTF ;-)<br><br>One other nasty just got me a few days ago ... I was installing SP3 to my XP machine and once that was done (no small job, I can tell you) I got waves and waves of updates for it.  One of those installed something called Microsoft Desktop Search.  Of course, Google has a much better one, which you don't have to lose space on the lower tool bar to use .. you just hit CTL twice.  In any case, when I realized it was taking about 20% of the CPU and eating up valuable disk space, I tried to uninstall it.  Yeah, right.  I got a message that most of my previous patches would stop working if I dared uninstall their beautifully useless desktop search.  Now I'm hunting for a way to disable it so I can live with it without losing my resources.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 22:18 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike<br><br>Haven't come across Microsoft Desktop Search - (which sounds like a good thing!) It's all very well when MS give you the option to choose what to install but whoever is going to look at a list of Kthis and Kthat and have the remotest idea whether they need the update or not  - and who thinks up their names anyway.  I don't WANT something with the word Malicious in it's name on my computer but hey, do I get a choice?  It really does start to make you think that the pre-creation days when the world was gently populated by such creatures as Dos, where people communicated WordPerfectly and grew Lotus123's, sigh, perhaps those really were the "good old days"!  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 23:16 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>Yeah, the good old days.<br><br>Forget Microsoft's search.  You might like Google Desktop, it really does come in handy.  It finds a word if it is a file name, an email, a folder, or a web page you visited.  You hit CTL twice and it pops up a small dialog box where you put in the word then it instantly shows you what it finds ... well, the first four or so then offers to pop up a browser window to show you the rest.<br><br>But the real thing is that it does not eat up the CPU.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 2:38 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike<br><br>Thanks for that - I'll put it on my list to check out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 8:46 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The problem I found with Google Desktop (and some other similar search programs) is that it won't let my Acronis Image Backup work.
