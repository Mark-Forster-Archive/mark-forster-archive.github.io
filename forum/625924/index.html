I think that just now I am actually doing AF as it was intended and finding it a blast.  I am trying not to get bogged down with too much analysis but more quickly cycle through the pages. <br><br>So far so good.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2009 at 19:29 | Jonathan B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am an INTP.

It is probably why this is my first comment although I started AF a week ago and there has been a lot I could have posted about.<br><br>I found AF difficult at first, having come from highly structured task planning using MyLifeOrganized (MLO). I tried AF on paper first, but that was such a departure from what I have been used to for the last ten years, I found lots of problems with it. I tried to combine it with MLO, but it isn't really suited. I tried using Jarte, which worked quite well, and I tried Excel, which worked less well, but have surprisingly come back to paper, which I now think is the only way to do AF properly (for me, at least). The problems I had with paper turned out to be solely due to my unfamiliarity with it and my previous reliance on electronic technology.<br><br>So far, AF seems to be the best personal management system I have ever come across (and I have tried quite a few).

I freeze into hopeless procrastination when faced with a structured task list. I'm happily productive when I'm winging it, so long as in winging it I've got some sort of rough course charted. AF gives me the impression that I'm flying my own course, but keeps presenting me with markers to remind me that there are boundaries to navigate within. For my particular mindset, that's perfect.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 January 2009 at 1:25 | Matt C.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Frank - aren't you glad you gave in?  &lt;grin&gt;  Look what you've started!!!<br><br>As per previous post ENTJ and I find AF works exceptionally well for me.

The first list I found was an INTP list ... can you imagine.  I loved it.  It was heaven being with all of my long lost twin brothers and sisters (especially for an INTP type as we are in the minority ;-)  In order to get a feel for other MBTI types, I searched for lists devoted to those types.  Imagine my surprise when I found lists for some other types but almost NONE for "E" types.  My surprise lasted about five seconds then the light dawned.  Hell, they are all at a party now  ... i is only us "I" types who hang around in virtual space! ;-)<br><br>I have only thought of it in passing, but it would be a good subject to discuss somewhere.  What are the characteristics of those who post to internet mail lists, blogs, etc.  Introverts?  Yes, for sure.  There also seems to be a high incidence of ADD, and I'm sensing some bi-polarity as well.  But those are just impressions.  I'll bet someone is doing a PhD thesis somewhere ... ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2009 at 12:04 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Frank's comments re E's and Time Management are interesting; unfortunately for me my Time Management issues might tell everyone else to "get a life" but somehow I never have time for one myself.  If being a TM expert means identifying and/or creating great systems from everyone else then I probably qualify - I know a great deal about TM systems &lt;grin&gt; but follow one ............?  (At least not until AF came along).<br><br>To clarify Introversion and Extraversion within MBTI, this relates to where we draw our energy from, and not how quiet or outgoing we may be.  I assumed when I did my test that I would be I (because I am generally comfortable with my own company and happy to work alone) but when I tested as an E I realised that I do in fact draw my energy from other people.  At work I had my own office but periodically had to go and wander around talking to other people.  I had always assumed it was because I was bored but it was a case of somehow topping up my energy.  I notice now that periodically I have to phone someone -I don't even particularly feel an overwhelming desire to carry on a conversation but somehow need that contact with another human being.  Don't know how that fits in with wandering around Discussion Forums.

Seems silly but there are things in them that require some consideration.  One "gotcha" is that personality type can SEEM to be influenced by context.  One example:  I am an Introvert, but I seem to be extroverted when I am at work.  In reality, in those cases I'm what is called a "compensated introvert" ... I can temporarily change my stripes, as it were ;-)  A professional (or someone who has lots of experience typing people) can get to the essential question of where your energy comes from.  One can have a big grin and shake all kinds of hands at a party, all the while feeling the life drain right out of him if he is a real Introvert.<br><br>My point is that when you answered the questions you might have been in a certain mood or not understood what some questions were really getting at.  This is very common and it can take a while for a person to type himself.  A pro can see all kinds of behavioral cues as well as just look at the answers on paper.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 January 2009 at 9:26 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>An ESTJ here - I am an avid fan of trying out new ways of being more efficient.

That does not in any way mean that I am deperate to party but that my energy levels/motivation etc. will be massively impacted by contact with others, whether it be in person, telephone, email or even interacting on this forum.  If I read about something that really motivates me, my first thought is "I want to share this with someone".  It can be incredibly frustrating if that person is an I and their response is along the lines of "tell me later when I'm not doing ....." as that immediately deflates the excitement and dissipates the energy.

I combine it with aspects of GTD, but notice how much more I get done creating a closed list on a daily basis, using My Life Organized software.  I tried Autofocus for a couple of weeks in a basic paper based system. I did get a lot of actions done. 36 actions the first week end. 47 on the third. My DIT approach seems to get around 30 actions per weekend. I didn't stick with Autofocus long enough to be able to make a fair comparison. DIT works well enough for me and I prefer to keep it electronical, and for now I haven't bothered with adapting the electronic tool, nor run two separate systems. In a sense works for me is: 1. Cycling through the lists frequently 2. Progressing stuff based on the "little and often" 3. Committing to a certain number of actions in a day (closed list) and score myself accordingly if I accomplish that number and 0 points if I don't (as per Mark's deceivingly simple, yet very powerful little exercise in DIT, only I apply on a regular basis.) 4. Breaking tasks down to bitesized manageable chunks 5. Enter next actions à la GTD 6. Always allowing intuition to play a part in deciding which of the next actions to do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2009 at 0:38 | David B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here's your first ENFJ. Amazing how many I's and N's have responded. I've been doing Autofocus for about ten days. After just reading Mark's outline I completed a major task that I had been putting off for, oh, about four years. It took me five minutes. That was enough to inspire me to start a list in a notebook. I think the notebook aspect has a lot to do with it. I've been a list-maker for years, but once you throw that scrap of paper away, there's no proof of achievement! I love to see all the items crossed out! My husband and I have completely re-worked my website over the past ten days, and Autofocus served to keep me on track. I also find it much easier to release things that I feel I should do but really don't want to. Instead of feeling a tug of conscience, I just grin and keep going down the page. <br><br>I should also mention that we just got DSL about two hours ago and this is the first forum I felt drawn to check out.

I have been using AF for a month or so.  I find it great in that it has forced me to not be so rigid (I have issues with always wanting to be in control!), but very difficult for the same reason.  I feel like I am just doing "whatever" sometimes rather than something that really needs to be done.  I am also borderline Asperger's, so this is prolly related to the need for rules and boundaries.  AF is (hopefully) helping me get over this, as I'd like to be a little more comfortable with being spontaneous.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2010 at 0:34 | RT</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
