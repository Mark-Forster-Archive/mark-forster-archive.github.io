Try at your own risk.<br><br>I'm a mostly happy user of AF4. DWM, I couldn't hack its tie to the calendar, because I don't work the list every day.  I liked how DWM separated new items from re-entered items.  So I've been tweaking AF4, and I think I found a version I like!<br><br>I have four sections: D (closed), W (open), F (closed), and M (open), but really DW and FM are just AF4 lists.  New stuff is added to M.  If I work on something, it moves to W.<br><br>I set size limits on W and M (number of active tasks).  Once they get too big, I dismiss half of D, and merge W into D.  I dismiss half of F and merge M into F.  The effect is the same progression as DWM, and the same effective limit on how many things you have, but it's not driven by the calendar but by your working.<br><br>Two unknowns: Exactly how big is too big, depends on your working habits, and may vary over time.  <br>Scanning pattern not sure what's best.  For now I think DWWWWFM is my plan.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 June 2010 at 21:13 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>You always have interesting ideas/tweaks!  I'm having trouble visualizing what you're doing.  Perhaps it's the labels - is D for Day, W for Week, and M for month?  What about F?  Also, I'm guessing you're using a computer and not a paper notebook, because you say you set size limits to the number of *active* tasks rather than the number of lines on each page.  For those of us using paper, how would your system work?  If you don't mind, please give specific examples with page numbers, etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2010 at 0:12 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks.  I'll try.  In DWM, the Day page (today) is ready to be dismissed, the Week page (today+7) is where stuff is re-entered, and the Month page (today+28) is where new stuff goes.  There's also pages in between.  I suppose F could stand for Fortnight.  (or focus or whatnot).  Except since I'm not using a calendar, the names don't apply but it works like DWM.<br><br>The paper implementation would simply be two AF4 lists with a dividing line separating closed from open.  Two ten-foot scrolls should work quite well, or else the front and back or top and bottom of a notebook.So D and W are one AF4 list.  F and M are a second AF4 list, but the rules are slightly different.  <br><br>I am digital, so yeah stuff disappears when I finish it, that's why I count as I do.  I imagine you could have success if you just went by how many pages are allowed.  How many I'm sure depends on how you work.<br><br>Illustration?  I'm not so good at that.  <br>I start at the D, scan down, find a task, work, rewrite at end of W.  Continuing in D, I find something I don't want to do anymore, and delete it.<br>Continue through D, pass the dividing line into W.  Work W, rewriting tasks at the end of W.  Eventually get bored of W stuffs and move on to the second list.<br>Starting at the beginning of F, I pass through, looking for things that either need to be done, or things I really am not going to do.  If I do any, I rewrite in W.<br>Crossing over the line into M, I scan as before.<br><br>At some point, like when my W list grows to 15 active items (or 30 or 60), I decide it's too much, and shift them to D.<br><br>Essentially, W is my working list.  It's the stuff I've done recently and what I generally aim to complete, what I'm trying to focus on, finish what you started, etc.  If I have too many things running, I shove everything to D, and rebuild my W list.  D is the list of things I was working on but put aside.  By the next round, those D items I still haven't worked on are dismissed.  But like in DWM I can save them by just working on them a bit first.<br><br>M is the list of new stuff.  F is the list of old stuff that I've ignored.  Same principle here.  Why keep looking over stuff and ignoring it?  If I ignore it long enough, I should just delete it.<br><br>For all of this, the trick is figuring how much stuff you should have.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2010 at 1:23 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree, Alan always comes up with interesting stuff!<br><br>For me, DWM works well precisely because it's tied to the calendar.  Otherwise my lists would grow indefinitely, which is always what happened with me with AF1 and AF4.  DWM's auto-dismissal based on expiration date forces me to limit new commitments so I can actually do the work that I commit myself to do, and helps me gauge exactly how much I can really handle.  It's especially effective at dealing with my irregular productivity, not knowing (because of health reasons) whether tomorrow or the next day will really be fully productive days.  The threat of dismissal is a sign that I can't keep up with my commitments and need to scale back, renegotiate priorities, or whatever.<br><br>Removing the calendar aspect would remove the key element that makes DWM successful for me.   I can't see how DWMF would help me regulate my workload as effectively.<br><br>But hey, if DWMF works for you, great!  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 June 2010 at 0:28 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I bet it would be less effective for you. I'm not even sure it'll be effective for me ;-)<br>Anyhow you'll note the sizecap I wrote in the rules attempts to abduct DWM's benefit with a different means.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 June 2010 at 1:43 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Awesome idea!<br><br>This separates the tasks that you are actively working on.  The rest of the items go into a list of things you're still thinking about.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 June 2010 at 17:33 | James R</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
