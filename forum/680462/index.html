No need to keep track of the current page - it's always on top, staring at you.<br>2. No need for a system of transferring tasks to a new notebook - just add more cards.<br>3. No need for a system to indicate that a page is completed - just remove the card.<br>4. Easier to find dismissed tasks for review - archive those cards separately.<br>5. Easier to integrate special "context" / "urgent" / "checklist" cards into the system<br><br>For the basic mechanics, a lot depends on the particular cards you get. Levenger sells 5x3 cards with 20 lines in portrait format, but a cheaper option would be regular office-supply cards with a 1/4" grid, for 25 lines. You could also scale up to 4x6 cards.<br><br>Circa/Filofax/ring binder users can obviously reap most of the same benefits by moving pages around, but at the cost of more time and $$$.<br><br>I can't be the first one to have had this idea, so - has anyone else implemented it? Are there any pitfalls that I've missed? Otherwise I'm thinking of giving it a go tomorrow :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2009 at 4:02 | Jonathan H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I did consider using the index cards I have here, which are portrait-oriented and have 17 lines. I read through the intro material a few more times, and became convinced that I should at least start out around the recommended 25-30 items per page.<br><br>My eventual choice had 29 lines, but I'm still getting used to the system and so I can't say for sure whether it's working.  I have wondered a few times if having less lines would be helpful, because then I'd be quicker in flipping through the pages.  Would that be motivating?  Would having less tasks to choose from be helpful (incentive is to clear the page, maybe?) or more likely for the page to be dismissed too early?<br><br>I don't know the answers.  I am just suspecting that the number of items makes a difference, and I also suspect that people will differ in whether they like to work from a page with a lot of items listed on it or only a few.<br><br>I've also started suspecting that I would do better if my autofocus pages had fewer items! But I also separate my lists into Work and Home lists, so maybe that's why I think it would work.  If other people are splitting into even more contexts, I can totally see how each list would need to be shorter anyway, in order to keep the focus narrow enough to really consider each item on the page, when working from smaller contexts especially.<br><br>I'll leave you with something to consider:  how do you think the number of lines on the page will affect you and the way *you* work?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2009 at 6:21 | Qrystal</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>More lines will give you more time to revisit tasks before having to face them or dismiss them.  Fewer lines might increase resistance.  I think it might be an entirely personal thing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2009 at 9:05 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>With autofocus.cc, I can dynamically change the number of items per page, so if I notice that a certain setting doesn't work for me, I can reorder my list within seconds. For example, at the beginning I had 10 items per page, but then I permanently ran into the issue that I didn't feel "ready" yet for the last few items on a page and had to dismiss them. I decided to switch to 20 items per page, which seems to have improved my flow significantly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2009 at 9:50 | Andreas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'd previously been using a gridded Moleskine Reporter notebook, with about 24 items per page. So far using 3x5 cards with 20 items per card doesn't feel like a big change. <br><br>I definitely agree that the "best" number of items per page is going to depend on both the person and the circumstances. There was an interesting poll on the Yahoo group about paper-vs-digital: maybe the next poll could be about number of items per page?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2009 at 18:26 | Jonathan H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Actually, while I'm using a notebook now, I don't see any reason not to use 3x5 cards, and I think the description in the original posting of how to go about it ought to work well. I've used a Levenger "Pocket Briefcase" pretty routinely, along the lines of a "Hipster", sorta., and it's worked quite well for me.<br><br>I'd hope that the difference between 20 lines on a Levenger's card versus 24 lines in a Moleskine notebook isn't the "make or break" factor with this system...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2009 at 5:21 | Lefty</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>What will you do with the cards once you have completed or dismissed all the activities?<br><br>I am only in the 3rd day of my paper based AF trial and already I like the fact I have a chronological record of the items I have added in a bound notebook. <br>I am using an A5 notebook which gives me a fair amount of space to write<br>a details item.

Ironically it was the very flexibility of the system that caused problems. I found it too easy to shuffle cards around, which resulted in more planning/thinking about tasks and less actual *doing* of them. <br><br>It's made me realize that part of the beauty of Autofocus is the very linear, page-by-page way of working through a notebook. Once you finish a page, there's no question about what to do next: just turn to the next one! <br><br>Other people with more self control might have better luck using a Hipster PDA for their Autofocus lists... but then, if we all had self control, what are we doing on this forum looking for help? :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2009 at 19:44 | Jonathan H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's interesting to see several people trying different methods and ultimately coming back to a basic notebook.

The cards I've been using have a "title area" followed by 10 more lines.  Personally, I rather like having the "closed list" be no more than 10 items at a time, it's less overwhelming than a list of dozens.<br><br>Of course, having only 10 items per page has implications for dismissal.  On the other hand, Mark's Final Version system doesn't use a dismissal process at all, so why should an Autofocus system require it?  (That topic probably deserves its own thread...  Come to think of it, there's probably an existing thread about it!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 July 2012 at 22:08 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm sure you've noticed the threads about adding dismissal to FV.

It's not clear that anyone really feels a great need to add dismissal, nor that anyone has actually done so and found it useful/beneficial/workable.<br><br>As for the "Hipster PDA", the name sounds dumb but the idea is cute.  I've been using index cards with a binder clip for Marks systems (and my own variants thereof), and haven't had a problem with the binder clip -- but I've been tending to leave it in the office, not carry it around everywhere.  In a sense, the binder clip is optional -- it just helps keep the stack of cards from falling apart accidentally.<br><br>With some systems (like FV), I found that I flipped through the cards often enough that it was easier to leave the binder clip off all day.  With my current AF1 variant, I generally leave it on except when I need to switch cards, which isn't as frequent as it was with FV.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2012 at 19:46 | Deven</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You read the link correctly.
