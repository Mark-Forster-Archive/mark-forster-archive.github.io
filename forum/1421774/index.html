What are you all finding?<br><br>For example, if I put just a few too many urgent items in C2, then I get stuck on that page.   And I get stuck on the next page, too.  It starts to take nearly all day to get through a page or two.  Too slow.<br><br>Meanwhile, lots of new items are piling up at the end of the list -- getting further and further away.   I start to become afraid that it will take me too long to get to them, since I am stuck on my current page, somewhere in the middle of the notebook.   So, I start entering one or two of them into my current C2, as "urgent" items  (using Mark's definition of urgent = "you want to get to it before you would through the normal processing of the list").<br><br>Of course that just slows everything down more, since I have even more C2 items I must action at each turn of the page.<br><br>Eventually this just crashes.   <br><br>Personally, I don't find "system crash" to equate to "self-correcting".   The system crashing and forcing me to start over from scratch doesn't really help.  I know, because when I restart the system, I eventually fall into the same pattern.  And the system crashes again!<br><br>I am trying to see if I can come up with a way to make this actually self-correcting -- meaning, if you start to get stuck somewhere, and your C2 starts to fill up, the system will automatically react and somehow start to force you along more quickly.   Maybe through triggering more dismissals.  Maybe through forcing you to turn pages more quickly somehow.  But I want this to be RULE-BASED, not "common-sense" based.  I want the SYSTEM to teach me how to stop crashing it, just by following the rules of the system.<br><br>This is why I am trying Mark's experiment for myself, of entering urgent items on C2 of the NEXT page.   Mark said that would make things move more quickly.   Maybe that's what a person should do automatically, whenever you find it takes more than a day to turn the pages through your whole list.<br><br>None of this is intended as criticism of Mark - not by any means - I have the deepest respect for him, and am so thankful for all the work he's done.   I just want to see if I can make this system work for me more effectively, as a SYSTEM, not with frequent "common sense overrides" (since I don't have much of that, when I am buried with crises), and not with piles of idiosyncratic "tweaks" but with one or two very simple "adjustments" that follow the spirit of the original rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 2:40 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Right now I'm the pariah on these boards, so I apologize if my response kills your thread. <br><br>&lt;&lt;But I want this to be RULE-BASED, not "common-sense" based&gt;&gt;<br><br>Yup, as do I.

(These are great principles, and "little and often" tends to produce these kinds of tasks anyway, but it requires much more rigor than the fundamental rule, "put whatever you want on the list")<br><br><br>I'm looking for something much simpler, like "if the list is bogging down for you, try entering your urgent tasks on the NEXT page, since this tends to make the system go faster".   <br><br>Or "try reducing the number of lines in C1 relative to C2, since this will tend to reduce the time you spend cycling through the tasks on any one page".<br><br>These are very simple mechanical rules that can make the system move faster and reduce C2 congestion, without the need for frequent invocation of "common sense" rules or introducing new rules that go contrary to the fundamental "in the zone" concepts of Autofocus.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 5:42 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Don wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; I've noticed a kind of oscillation of C2 as you've pointed out, but I don't know what you mean by "system crash". &gt;&gt;<br><br>I mean that the system moves so slowly that you can only get through a page or two each day, meanwhile adding 2 or 3 pages to the end of the list each day.   <br><br>Or, column 2 gets so filled up everywhere that you frequently enter unfinished tasks not on the next page, but 2 or 3 or 4 pages forward.<br><br>The system just doesn't work well when these things start to happen.   And the system doesn't recover by itself from these problems.   The user is forced to invoke "common sense" rules to get out of the problem (e.g., decommissioning lots of C2 unfinished items by moving them to end-of-list C1) or to simply start over.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; When I got stuck on a page, I was still doing a lot of important work. I ended up finishing or actioning everything on the page before moving on. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, I find that happens, too.  The longer you stay on a page, the more often you cycle through each task -- and each exposure to a task reduces your resistance to it.  So they all tend to stand out after awhile.<br><br>I often find myself completing 80%+ of the C1 items on a page, the very first time I arrive on that page.   Adding new urgent things on C2 of the current page makes this worse, since I cycle through the whole page a lot more while I'm working those C2 items, and that cycling makes a lot more of the C1 tasks "stand out".<br><br>But that's really not how the cycling is supposed to happen.  The repeated exposure that breaks down resistance is supposed to happen by means of cycling through the *entire list* many times, clearing a much smaller percentage each time you work through a page.  This keeps the whole list fresh, and prevents you from bogging down in the middle, and being forced to endlessly chase the end of the list.<br><br>I still get lots done even when moving slowly -- much more than with AF or even DWM.   But it just gets slower and slower every day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 5:51 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Problem comes from column 1.

Knowing it's important to move toward influences me to say no to the things that cry "maybe".

Basically we don't want C2 to clog up with too many urgent tasks.  So, take them offline, or make more room for them.  <br><br>I'll try one of those after I'm done with my experiment of entering them on C2 of the following page.  I'm expecting that to provide some relief.  If it's not enough, then I'll try reducing the number of lines in C1 (thus increasing the relative number of lines in C2) and/or taking urgent items offline.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 16:43 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Erik,<br><br>&lt;&lt; Answer: Smaller tasks in column 1 &gt;&gt;<br><br>The AF systems tend to develop that habit anyway.  But trying to make a rule out of it goes against one of the more fundamental rules:  "enter whatever you want into the list".  Just like I don't always have time or attention to break things down into GTD-ish "next actions", I also don't always have time or attention to ask ahead of time, "Am I writing this small enough?"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 16:46 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan - <br><br>Yes, the system does tend to teach you things.   The threat of dismissal makes some things stand out, that otherwise wouldn't.   You are right about that.<br><br>That doesn't seem to work the same way, though, for preventing C2 congestion.  The action required is specific, and the results are immediate, with the threat of dismissal.  The action required isn't quite so clear, and the results are not quite so tangible or so immediate, when faced with the threat of C2 congestion.   <br><br>If your system works for you, great!  use it!!   I personally don't want to get into the habit of decommissioning C2 items whenever it gets clogged up, because I have found it takes away some of the effectiveness of having C2 in the first place.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 16:51 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt;urgent tasks on a separate sheet of paper seems roughly equivalent to my idea of making sure C2 has several lines more than C1&gt;&gt;<br><br>Only roughly equivalent, because a separate sheet does not block page turning in SF. <br><br>The way I'd do this: Work on your urgent tasks. If you finish them all, good: Back to SF. If you get blocked or exhausted, you'd schedule a timebox of SF work (until such time you can or must continue urgent work.) You'd be free to turn pages according to SF rules. When the timer chimes, back to the urgent list. And so on.

So either you have to finish it as written, regardless of column, or you don't. Combined with Mark's remark that "the system forces you to finish tasks once you've started them.", I think he must have intended the written task description to be pretty much binding. Where's the force, otherwise?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 22:12 | Marcus</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan, while I agree with you that you can, in most ways, put anything you want in the system, I have to point out that Marcus is right in what he is saying. Most of Mark's advice on SF3 is that you have to define what done means before starting the task and entering it in C2.<br><br>My advice is not to define it at entry but when you star to work on it. Let it percolate all you want and when you feel the time is right to move on it, define what that entails before you write it in C2.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 22:17 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree 100% with that advice.  If the rules as written forbid refining of tasks entered, they were written incorrectly, because that's contrary to Mark's intention to allow intuition.  The only point where it matters to have a precise scope is if it enters column 2.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 22:26 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark wrote<br>&lt;&lt;Daouda: Mark is of course right, generally speaking, because you can enter tasks such as "explore X for a short while" or "develop Y, a little, maybe" or "let Z percolate a bit".

Entering without thought, not having to pre-plan, was how I understood Seraphim's "enter whatever you want into the list". &gt;&gt;<br><br>If this is true (I cant tell, I havent tryed SF yet), then it should definitely have been part of the SF instructions, formulated as clearly as you just did, even better with some specific examples. Especially for the folks that are coming from AF1 etc.<br><br>If your interpretation of the rules is correct, it also means that you cannot use the SF list as an instant "ubiquitous capture tool" for any action-related thought anymore.<br>This changes (restricts) the possible use of the list, and would make the addition of some "instant capture" list almost necessary, which is precisely the kind of overhead, unneeded with AF1, that Marks seems to avoid with his systems.<br><br>Let's see :<br>If one wants to instantly capture such actionnable thoughts that he is unsure about wether doing or simply exploring, then I guess he should do something like using the back of the SF notebook for this (capturing these "tasks"), and enter a recurring task along the line of "review stuff at the back of the notebook". <br>During that "review" a decision would be made about the tasks which should then be entered (or not) into the SF list with the adequate formulation. "Tasks" not transferred to the SF list could be deleted forever, or left there for the moment, or put in a tickler/outlook reminder for later entry... Maybe even transferred to a longer-term, more thought-out "dismissed-pending-someday/maybe-whatever" folder reviewed weekly. [Although this is probably superfluous and redundant, and the 2 lists - back of book "rough thoughts" with "dismissed-someday" folder - should better be combined somehow?] <br><br>This so we could keep the benefit of being able to write stuff down immediately without pre-planning... at the expense of quite some additional overhead vs AF1. Note that another benefit would be to keep the main list shorter vs AF1 (some stuff would be pre-dismissed or deleted). It could prove awkward in practice though. Or maybe, even worse, what i just wrote doesnt make any sense since making the decision about wether "enter in C1" or "write in the back of the notebook" is pretty much the same than deciding to either write "do X" or "Explore X"...
