I don't think being an former heroin addict is wrong (which I think Jacqueline meant) and I don't think being committed to a mental hospital is wrong.<br><br>Disclaimer to explain my standpoint: My father was an alcoholic and killed himself when I was 15.

His system stands or falls on its own merits, not his.<br><br> But with many "gurus" it would matter a lot. Would you want your children in a cult run by someone with a history of mental illness and addiction? So I was challenging Jacqueline not on the question of whether it was morally wrong, but on the question of whether it mattered.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 December 2009 at 13:56 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;Would you want your children in a cult run by someone with a history of mental illness and addiction?&gt;&gt;<br><br>The answer that first springs to mind is that I'd prefer my children not joining any cults at all, if possible. And I would have more of a problem with a guru being someone who currently uses drugs (or even encourages others to do so) than with with one who used to do so, but doesn't do that anymore. Overcoming such things at least shows a tremendous amount of willpower. And not trying to hide past mistakes takes some courage.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 December 2009 at 15:39 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Actually, Jinny Ditzler, author of Your Best Year yet is also a follower of the Mystical Traveler.

Attacking a time management system by attacking the beliefs of that system's advocate is the paradigm of an _ad hominem_ argument. It reminds me of Stalin rejecting what we would today call computer science, because it was based on Aristotelian, rather than Hegelian, logic.

The only thing it would suggest to me is that someone who has had difficulties like that might feel a need for more control in their lives than someone who hasn't had those experiences, so their system would probably reflect that.  Like the article says in what I've excerpted below, which I really don't agree with.  I tend to think most things aren't as complex as we make them out to be.<br><br>"He realizes that his system can be difficult and that he's often accused of going overboard with elaborate schemes. He responds with a shrug. "Look, the workings of an automatic transmission are more complicated than a manual transmission," he says. "To simplify a complex event, you need a complex system." " <br><br>It doesn't concern me when an individual gets their information from a book or site like GTD or Covey as someone can easily take or leave what they read in a book.   Where I would be cautious in a circumstance like this is with the individual coaching services that are also provided by that company.  From what I've read, the leaders in that company are all members / ministers of MSIA.<br><br>I don't even think that particular MSIA group is evil, just kind of new age / alternate Christianity.  So if I was getting coaching from someone in that group, I would want to know exactly what their philosophies were in case they recommended that I go to a workshop or seminar because the teachings would conflict with my own beliefs.  (Which, don't worry Mark - I will not elaborate on here!)  Or were coaching me from that perspective.<br><br>I wonder too if perhaps some of the teachings that DA has put into GTD which are right from the old Lifespring training (eg. extreme rigidness to keeping commitments) aren't a good thing anyway.  Taking the extreme rigidness out of it.  But I prefer the AF philosophy of not sticking rigidly to commitments but to pare them down to what is manageable for you and what you really want or need to do (which is what "stands out" and dismissal means to me).<br><br>This is the seminar company that DA references when he talks about what he did as a seminar leader for years before forming the DA company:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.icsahome.com/logon/elibdocview.asp?Subject=Light+on+Insight">http://www.icsahome.com/logon/elibdocview.asp?Subject=Light+on+Insight</a><br><br>And this is the type of thing that really bugs me, bilking people when they're emotionally vulnerable is just wrong:<br><br>"(A "Gift of Giving" session was added at the end of the five-day Insight seminar in which some people were so euphoric that they made out $10,000 checks to the group.) MSIA recruited many Insight graduates, although the link between the two organizations - Insight trainers were usually MSIA ministers, the two shared an idiosyncratic philosophy, and Insight reportedly "tithed" to MSIA - was unknown to seminar attendees."<br><br>And given that I've been on these things before, I know how easy it is to take advantage of people when they really aren't thinking clearly.<br><br>Maybe I'm over-sensitive about this stuff, but I was introduced to the LOA world and way of thinking years ago by a personal coach before I had a BS detector in place, and it really did mess with my productivity - and life in general - for a long time. <br><br>Andreas, I wanted to say that I am so sorry about your loss.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 December 2009 at 16:59 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm not saying someone who got addicted and overcame it has an advantage over someone who never got addicted in the first place.

He had his own blog, and he also posted on David Allen's website. I had made some posts about the more profound, unstated, assumptions that, at that time, I thought underlay GTD. This GTD employee wrote me a personal e-mail thanking me for my comments and adding some comments of his own that continued the conversation. (By the way, my theology or lack thereof was unknown to this employee and did not figure in the posts that I had made.)<br><br>This guy did not try to recruit me to anything. He just was interested in continuing the discussion of time management.<br><br>Soon after that, some anti-cult people started going after David Allen bigtime. My attitude was one of bemusement. If Allen's cult did something truly illegal, then I think they should throw the book at them. But most of the accusations I have read were along the lines of the concept of a Mystical Traveler is bizarre and many things that his followers believe are bizarre. My response was, "bizarre compared to what?" The beliefs of any religion that I have studied strike me as bizarre.<br><br>The argument that was being made against GTD was that it was a "totalizing" system. Presumably, this meant that you were to put everything in your life into the system. What was never clear to me was how this was causally linked to my being brainwashed to follow the Mystical Traveler. Mark, just a few entries above, jokingly told me to beware AF's subtle influence on my beliefs. But, of course, he was joking and I get the joke. Even if Mark's Catholicism enabled him to conceive and perfect AF, its contribution to my productivity can be evaluated independently of its religious origins.<br><br>Aristotle, like virtually all ancient Athenian citizens, supported slavery. Is that a good reason to oppose syllogistic reasoning?<br><br>I no longer see much value in GTD, now that I've become comfortable with Mark's systems. But I am still willing to give David Allen a vigorous defense against what I perceive to be some low blows. Please understand, I find his belief in the Mystical Traveler as intellectually offensive as anyone. But if I only defended those with whom I agreed against ad hominem arguments, what kind of credibility would I deserve?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 December 2009 at 18:47 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Moises!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 December 2009 at 19:09 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;I am an atheist (though not a member of any atheist organization).

In my view, no one is "an atheist".  It is not something one IS.  Because society in general is so daffy as to believe in things that do not exist and demand that everyone do, one is basically forced to take on a label for not doing so.  I simply do NOT accept the beliefs others have in what does not exist.  That is all the term means.  How silly would it if people started calling themselves "achocolate eaters" or "a tocoists" or whatever.  That we even have such a term as "atheist" is nuts.<br><br>&lt;whew, I feel so much better now&gt;  ;-)  ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I wonder how people of faith can be so wrongheaded.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>People of EVERYTHING can be wrongheaded.

Attacking a time management system by attacking the beliefs of that system's advocate is the paradigm of an _ad hominem_ argument. It reminds me of Stalin rejecting what we would today call computer science, because it was based on Aristotelian, rather than Hegelian, logic. He kept the USSR ideologically pure and set back its technological development even further. I could limit myself to studying the work of atheists only. That might keep me ideologically pure. But would it really serve my overall well being.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>The thing is, people are basically consistent, at some level or other ;-)  If a guy joins cults, one has to question his reasoning about the best way to do filing.  True, if it IS the best way, judged by your own standards and needs, then fine.  But, working backward, I am able to explain why his way of doing things is wrong for me because his personality has some "glitches".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 December 2009 at 0:55 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"GEEEEEZ, I go out to shovel the driveway and I'm late to one of the best conversations lately"<br><br>If you get out of your driveway, you won't be able to avoid better.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 December 2009 at 1:08 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  And given that I've been on these things before, I know how easy it is to take advantage of people when they really aren't thinking clearly.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>That really goes on a lot ... and especially with seminars.

If you stuck with his program, you'd wind up paying tens of thousands of dollars for an advanced seminar and even more for individual counseling.  I got what there was to be gotten from a $10 book.  There was really no more to it than what was in the book.  Likewise there is no more to DA's seminars and counseling sessions than is in the first book.

I see that mostly with religious people, but there are also some atheist zealots that act that way. (A this point, those atheists will jump me and claim that "atheism isn't a belief system, it's the lack of a belief system, therefore there can be no atheist zealots". but that's not true in my opinion.

Richard Dawkins thrives on it and he'd like to see religions change because if he puts it bluntly they are supposedly stupid. <br><br>Science to me is just as much of a religion. One can't even practice science without having bias or a belief system effecting its results. There's no real way around that, but some scientists thinks science is truly objective. What makes me find a certain dogmatic scientific approach hypocritical, especially when someone like Richard Dawkins 'preaches it', is that they commit the same errors as organized religions have commonly practiced it. When someone starts dictating what the right way of thinking ought to be, I don't care under what guise it is, for me the red flags go up. <br><br>Science might appeal more as a rational upgrade because it feels like it explains things in ways we can grasp in a more tangible way, but at the same time is severely limited in answering a multitude of meaningful questions. Science can only validate what it can measure - right now we can measure a couple of dimensions. Some scientists claim there are over a dozen dimensions. Who knows, but currently science tries to explain everything with what it can measure with these few dimensions. By definition it has a limited lens. The trouble is that scientists fall into a trap thinking that everything can be explained in the dimensions we can measure and when it does not, other theories are considered magical thinking and religious. To me that is the ultimate in ignorant arrogance. <br><br>Point in case, if you watch a intelligent design versus evolution debate. If you so much hint at believing or considering an intelligent design approach, the 'evolutionists' will ridicule you.  <br><br>What's funny to me is that the population that partake in religion are statistically across the board happier than those that do not practice or believe in a certain religion.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 December 2009 at 13:49 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I still do not think trashing the David Allen company and David Allen in particular is warranted.
