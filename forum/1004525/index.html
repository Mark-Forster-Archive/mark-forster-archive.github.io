Although in the past I always treated these like appointments and put them in iCal, not on my AF list, it seems that with DWM I could enter them on the date they must be done, perhaps with an asterisk to show they are 'different' from the other items on the page.  This way I wouldn't have to check in two places.<br><br>Apologies if this question has already been dealt with, but I haven't had time to read all comments yet.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 16:13 | acedia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Okay, now I have read some (!) of the comments already posted, I see that Mark doesn't recommend adding items to any dates, other than 'today plus a week' and 'today plus a month'.  So I have a choice of adding a dated task to 'today plus a month' and trusting that I will see it on the right day OR continuing as before and putting dated items on a calendar, just like appointments. <br><br>Is that correct?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 16:31 | acedia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Acedia,<br><br>I would say that the second option would be the better one. No use seeing a task on your list every day for a month and not being able to work on it yet. If it's something that has to be completed on a specific date but can be worked on before that, I put it in my DWM-list at the one-month-from-now-page, and put the deadline next to it to remind myself. With AF4 I've sometimes put an additional note in my calendar to remind myself of the deadline, but only when I know it's going to be a high-resistance task with a very hard deadline.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 16:50 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For me it's correct but after a daily try it doesnt work with me. If a task must be done one day i put it on the due date, If there is a deadline dido. If i plan to do and action on a specific date because i have a due date or a deadline afterterward i plan it on the dat i must do it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 16:52 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jupiter<br>I agree.  I'm more concerned with how soon I can start rather than how long I can wait.<br>Some undone things add too much mental chatter in my mind.  I'd rather get it over with or at least done enough for today to suit me.  I suppose everybody has a different orientation toward their work.  Bottom line:  Do what works best for you!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 17:24 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>I don't want to mislead you into believing that I don't have to fight resistance.  I do!  ...but...I'd rather start attacking it in bits rather than have the whole project looming in my future!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 17:29 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Acedia - I put things that can't be started yet on my calendar on the first day it can be started, at 8am (0 min duration) as a tickler. On that day I move it to my AF/DWIM list and work on it as appropriate.<br><br>I do the same thing for recurring things that are once a week or less often - seeing it on the AF/DWM lists every day is just too much "mental chatter" for me. If I can't do until next Tuesday, I don't want to see it at all UNTIL next Tuesday - especially since there's a really good chance that on Tuesday, I'd skip over it on the list, again, because it's 'melted into the background'.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 17:42 | Lillian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for all the replies!<br><br>Just to clarify, I'm only talking about things that MUST be done on a specific day - not before, not after - rather than those tasks that have deadlines, but which can be started well beforehand.  I totally agree that starting early and working little and often is the best approach when fighting resistance!  <br><br>But these are generally quite small tasks,, where the timing is important - like making a bill payment on the right day, buying tickets as soon as booking opens, calling someone on the best day to get them in person.  I suppose I am trying to combine DWM with a reminder system (or tickler file, if you prefer.)  <br><br>In the past , Mark has always said that date sensitive tasks should be entered on a calendar or other reminder system and, as he hasn't said anything to the contrary in his instructions for DWM, I am guessing that hasn't changed.  So for the time being, I will keep my reminders in iCal, as before.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 18:10 | acedia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi acedia<br>I wish I could remember where I read the suggestion, but some folks are recording non-negotiables on one column and Mark's new system in another column.  That seems to make sense to me....but....I haven't begun testing the system yet.  Some have the schedule and column for listing on one page and some have it spread across 2 facing pages...similar to planner choices available.  Please note that I'm not urging this.  I simply read about it a couple times and it sounded like it might effectively address your concern.  Be sure you test it Mark's way first unless you know full well that you would work best doing it slightly different.<br>Good luck.  Tell us how it goes for you!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 18:42 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Acedia,<br>I put them on the "real" Calendar.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 19:06 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I put tasks with a deadline on the deadline date's page (if this is before the regular page to put it on aka today+7 or today+28). The page you put a task on describes it's expiry date, if you don't do anything with this task by than, it will expire/be dead/dismissed,.... That's exactly what happens with a "deadlined" task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 17:03 | Christian G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As I've said before on some thread or other,  DWM is designed to be a series of closed lists with two "open" entry points. If you start adding tasks to the closed lists, you will destroy the whole basis of the system.<br><br>I am dealing very effectively with loads of "same day" and deadlined tasks simply by following the rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 17:28 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
