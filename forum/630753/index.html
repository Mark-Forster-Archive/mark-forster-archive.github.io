So when you've come to last page, you cycle back to the first past page still active : the first with upper corner not teared.<br><br>(thought of that when I&nbsp;got my page 2 closed, whilst page 1 still had a dozen active items)<br><br>=== My Digital tips ===<br><br>I've choosen to stay digital because of :<br>* Cleanliness and order (I am very bad to keep papers clean and in good order in the long run)<br>* copy (eventually import from a mail or doc, export ...)<br>* search / filter (answer which tasks have I&nbsp;recorded for that person or that project )<br>* Tagging (I&nbsp;manage to put keywords like who for, what for, ... ) in the item label to ease reviewes or searches<br>* Notes (eventually pasted clip of a paragraph that was the source of my thought, detail not to forget that came to mind during slow pace reading, stored link to a doc or an email, etc)<br><br>I soon dissmissed desktop, laptop and even my Tablet (1), and settled to my old pda (still a Palm), always at hand wherever I am on which I am already trained to write easily. Which app then ? &nbsp;I&nbsp;soon rejected outliners, Word, Excel or databases, and simply choosed to work with ... memos.<br><br>--- Memos for AF ---<br><br>I found most important to keep the AF "Page" concept, and to mimic a paper notebook :<br><br>* I do not use a memo as an AF page, but as an AF item, in the category "Autofocus".<br>* Pages are screen displays of "Autofocus" list of memos (with my font setting it makes 20 items a screen).<br><br>* I put dividers bottom of each screen (a blue dotted line, ie an empty memo which title is a dotted line, set to display in blue). That's how I&nbsp;new my remaining items on page 2 were to be dismissed.<br><br>* I&nbsp;never delete items (neither reorder) , but use color coding (two taps) to mark rejected (yellow pale), done (light gray), dismissed (bright orange). Outstandings are normal black.<br><br>* When an item stands out, I drag a green dotted line (another divider memo) just above it to bookmark the position. Back to pda, when I press memo button, it opens where I&nbsp;left : time to enter what's left to do (new memos are appended at the end of the list) and resume my slow pace reading down the current "page".<br><br>* If an item becomes an exception (urgency), I set it red &nbsp;and connect it to datebook (alarm). My current rule of thumb is to never have more than 3 exceptions a day, and not to let them live more than the day : if not done, then it should be either rejected (to late !) either restated as a new item (emergency action ?).<br><br>Keep it simple : most of my memos - currently 61 since I&nbsp;started anew with AF - are empty (but the title !). But for about six of them I'm happy to have a place for notes where to add a detail, store an exact wording, insert a due date, or a not before date, etc).<br><br>For now, I&nbsp;can just say I feel at ease with this organisation and AF process. I feel motivated to proceed as is...&nbsp;<br>... until I&nbsp;bump in one of my procrastinative blocks ?<br><br>(1) Another Win soft that seems excellent (clean, simple and straightforward) for digital AF is Tudumo</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2009 at 7:13 | Jacques Turbé</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nice ideas, Jacques!

I have a lot of things in OneNote that I'd like to see on my phone.  My experience so far is that:<br><br>- OneNote will sync from phone to PC but not vice versa (though people claim they have found a way to do that and someone even has a powertoy to help the process.<br><br>- The "sync" is more like a "copy".  The entire mobile database syncs to only a single book.<br><br>- OneNote mobile does not have the structure that makes it so useful on the PC.<br><br>If this is getting outside of the focus of the group here, I'd be happy to take it to private  email.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 12:47 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wowi--<br><br>I have 3 notebooks. One for stuff I can only do at home, one for stuff I can only do at work, and one for stuff I can do at any computer. the "Any" list is the largest; home and work are more static. <br><br>Because home and work tend to be shorter lists, I put them both on the same page (with the dynamic division between them suggested somewhere in the forum)--home at the top, work at the bottom. The Any list starts at the beginning of the notebook and works ahead; the Work/Home lists start at the back of the notebook and work forward. I mark the last page for each list with "page points" (cute little metal bookmarks from Levenger) to make it easy to find when adding new tasks. I use another one on the page I'm currently working on, with the "point" pointing right at the task I'm on. (Paper clips or sticky notes or whatever would work just as well; I just happened to have some of the points lying around.) <br><br>I have about 10 active pages currently, so it's not all that tough to figure out where I am, even without marking it; it's also usually very clear which list I should be focusing on at any moment. (ie, I'm at work: look at the work list! I'm on break at work: look at the Any list.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 17:03 | Beth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike<br><br>Thanks for the info.  I've checked out OneNote Mobile online and will certainly add it to my list to look at how it works on my phone.  I don't tend to use my phone apps a great deal - I tend to avoid mobiles where possible as they give me earache (even with an earpiece) but my current phone a Treo has excellent handsfree so that is no excuse now.  Will probably not check it out in detail immediately (unless AF tells me to of course!) but will let you know how I get on when I do.  Have tasked a reminder!  Will be happy to discuss over private mail if it gets technical rather than have a bunch of people running for the hills every time OneNote is mentioned. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 18:21 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To achieve something similar to Geoff's paper clip bookmarking, I use post-it index flags in different colors to mark the first active page, end of list and current working position (I'm not sure this hasn't been suggested by someone else, though). <br><br>It's not as useful for turning pages more easily, but they mark the respective pages even more obviously and are a little easier to apply than paper clips.<br><br>-- <br>Alex</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 22:54 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacques: <br><br>In the meantime, I downloaded PsMemo and tried it with my trusty old Palm m515 (!), but nowhere I could find an option to colorize individual memos. <br>Could you please give me some more instructions?<br><br>I can't find out how to send you an email, but I left a message on your homepage (?). <br>Is avm.online.fr still your site or is it/has it always been the site of Teri Pitman?

Indeed, I had already noticed the latest nightly but usually stick with 'final' resp. 'stable' releases. So I missed that.<br><br>But now that I tried it, this method looks too cumbersome to me, because PsMemo will send you directly to the memo after you select one in the list with a click. And you'll have to pick the color from a huge palette. <br>I'm thinking about asking Paul Nevai (who seems to be a nice guy from the contact I had with him some time ago) if he's still developing pedit and in case he is, whether he's willing to make some changes which would go well with AF. However, now that the Palm OS is officially dead, I doubt it.<br><br>Another problem I have is that my Palm is low-res, and will only show 10 items at a time on one screen. And I don't feel like buying a new one, because, well, the Palm OS is dead, did I already say that?<br><br>OTOH, Jacques, your idea for the standard memopad will only work if you don't use memos for anything else and use only AF categories, since you can only have one category shown, or all of them. Having other categories would completely dilute the system (hmm, would it?). To me, this seems too much of a sacrifice of functionality. I have lots of other memos. <br><br>It's a pity the stock todo app can't be used with AF. I can find no way to sort other than by priority, due date or category. And 15 categories max don't seem to be appropriate to use them as 'pages'. But now that I think of it... <br><br>All of this touches a major problem I have with the paper vs. digital question: Yes, it's easy to implement AF only with paper. But it seems to work best with only one 'book' and I don't feel like carrying around a A5 (or even A4) notebook, pad or binder. <br>And given that I already carry around a digital device (for calendar, address book and lots of other uses), I'd like to use only one device. But then, I haven't yet found something that's really usable on a PDA/smartphone or at least syncs nicely with my PC at work and my Mac at home. I can't say how trying all those Mac apps made me pull my hair out - Outlook on the PC solves the problem nicely, but on a Mac - no way (GTD all over the place, but no program will group or at least sort by creation date, and sync in a reasonable way; Entourage's and iCal's task sections are especially anemic compared to Outlook).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 January 2009 at 21:47 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alex,<br><br>(nb: on my Tx I can color or drag memos without opening them...)<br><br>If you still keep the idea of using your dear old Palm for AF so to be able to pick an items which stands out and is actionable where you are, or to enter a thought wherever you are you could play it like this: <br><br>"Page" divider memo : "=========" (fi every two screens)<br>Where you are bookmark : "    myCurrentStandingOut" (a tab begin of line to indent)<br>Prefix your done with "XXXmyDoneItem", your dismissed with "oooMyDissmissedItem", and trash, or set another category for done items.<br>Ought to be visual enough...<br><br>Just as an idea (I never praticed that :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 January 2009 at 20:42 | Jacques Turbé</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacques, <br><br>as always, great ideas from you :-) <br><br>Sent you a message off-list. <br><br>-- <br>Alex</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 January 2009 at 22:01 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike<br><br>re One Note Mobile - I've now installed it on my Palm Treo but see that it does only sync to it's own "Notebook".
