(This is not an issue with discrete tasks). <br>Solution: Spend upto 30 minutes and then stop.<br><br>Problem: Being disorganised for tomorrow because I've been working from my AF list.<br>Solution: Spend upto 60 minutes timed (2 x 30 mins) each evening tidying up / making lunch / preparing for next day meetings etc. <br><br>So, my day has 3 main parts to it - Clearing my inboxes, Autofocus and scheduled meetings and events, Tidy up / make lunch / prepare for next day. <br><br>I know it's not exactly rocket science but I thought it may be of use to others. Has anyone else had success with this type of approach?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 9:58 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Leon<br><br>I have definitely found at particular times that there are requirements to address an issue such as described above.  However what I have also found is that, as a result of AF seeming to "cause" the issue, it actually highlighted the root of the problem rather than just "create" a problem.  For me previous systems did manage things such as email but not always effectively and certainly not easily.  AF, by highlighting my resistance, made me think more creatively about the issue rather than finding yet another "just do it" approach.<br><br>Inboxes - I do periodically find my inbox builds up but as I have "check email" on every page I can always action it on a fairly frequent basis.  However I periodically (off list) check it just to ensure there is nothing vital.  If there is that will be sufficient to ensure the next "check email" task stands out!<br><br>Projects and Tasks - I find that my Project Management system (described elsewhere) enables me to have a reasonably good overview of each project. Although I have always run with a PM system AF has enabled me to redefine it and make it more efficient.<br><br>With regard to the whole "feeling disorganised" scenario, I find that having a list in view (I use a MindMap) of targets for the week, helps me to ensure that I block out time if necessary.  Time Blocks are often a necessity where we work to short deadlines but again I feel these can be handled within AF rather than too rigidly.  A task "planning for tomorrow" on every page, or something similar can deal with such things.<br><br>With meetings, they are timed events, and therefore the planning element has a deadline.  I have found that in some cases, where I have enough notice the planning and preparation can be done easily within AF.  In other cases that is not possible and so a Time Block period is required.  I personally would recommend not creating a regular Time Block for that purpose but using it as an emergency option only.  Otherwise the danger is that you could miss AF's prompting to look at a more systematic solution (eg ensuring that all meetings are scheduled at least a week in advance).<br><br>Leon, I think from your previous posts that you are a lot better at following a disciplined approach than I am so you may not find all of my suggestions to be helpful for your particular requirements, but hopefully something may be :-) <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 10:37 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Christine, you are probably right...I do like discipline and structure - which is why I got on well using DIT. But I also like the 'fluidity' and lack of friction of AF, so maybe I can strike a balance :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 10:57 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Leon<br><br>I hope you get it working well for you!  I've come to the conclusion that the biggest factor that influences us is the sense of control.  i always felt that I "ought" to be able to be disciplined, so when I wasn't felt "out of control".  By allowing me choice of time and action, AF gives me back that sense of control.  I would imagine though, that if you are able to work with the disciplined approach, then that very requirement to "give control" to "the system" can be really scary as you would naturally feel "out of control".<br><br>That would be an interesting study to look at ..... :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 11:05 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think though, that (a flexible)  structure and routine can also bring a sense of containment and calm.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 11:16 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Leon and Christine B,<br><br>Check this out -- I purchased this and it works very well for me when I need time blocks.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theactionmachine.com/">http://www.theactionmachine.com/</a><br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 14:56 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi David<br><br>Thanks for the link - looks a really good product as well as a clear description.  When I was planning for a trip and had a list of things to achieve beforehand I used to do something similar and it worked well. I am hoping I will be so organised in future that that will be a thing of the past but can see how this would be incredibly useful for time blocking.<br><br>One of the things I enjoy about this forum is the flow of ideas and the fact that, as we do work differently, we actually need slightly different ways to work with the system.  I also love that the system accomodates so many of these things.  I have tried time blocks and adding individual tasks and personally have decided I like adding all of the tasks - even if there are hundreds!  - better than using time blocks.  I think that is because in my discretionery time I have more leeway than others.  If I was in some of the office situations I have worked in previously then Time Blocks would definitely be the way to go.....</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 16:09 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the Link, David.

With AF's help I achieve a huge amount and am at present feeling very smug with myself, will post separately on some observations of using AF in mini list format for some specific "long weekend" projects later.<br><br>- titch</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 20:48 | titch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Pretty slick looking product.  Since I'm mostly bound to my pocket notebook, I do something similar.<br><br>- Wristwatch Timer (It has five of them ;-)<br>- - 20 Minutes (for a little an often effort on bigger projects ... such as learning a language)<br>- -   2 Hours (for larger chunks that require some focus ... non-fiction reading, for example)<br>- -   4 Hours  (for really large things such as going out and working with my camera)<br>- - 10 Minutes Repeating (for when I'm up against a deadline and it has to get done)<br><br>I keep a separate list of some of these things, but most of them are just in the AF list with a (20) or (2H) after them so I know what I intend to do.  I must confess that I often keep my computer open to my mind map that has much of my planning it it.  I have things marked by priority and time alloted and can quickly filter on them to see what I can do in 20 minutes or the next free block of 2 hours.  Just another way of getting to the same information.  But, most often, I just kind of know what I should be doing.<br><br>Alan Lakien advised asking, at every task switch:<br><br>"What it the best use of my time ...

The only reservation I have about it is that (unless I've missed an option somewhere) you can only time the intervals 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 minutes.<br><br>That means that you can't use it with the two best (imho) timer-based systems out there: 1) my own Get Everything Done system which uses timed bursts which increase by 5 minutes each repetition (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc); or 2) Francesco Cirillo's Pomodoro Technique which uses a burst of 25 minutes followed by 5 minutes break.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 April 2009 at 16:14 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike<br><br>When you say "most of them are just in the AF list with a (20) or (2H) after them so I know what I intend to do" does that not interfere wit hthe "for as long as you feel" rule or do you just do this for Time Blocking tasks?<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 April 2009 at 16:45 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wow Mike, a watch with 5 timers - do you mind me asking what watch it is?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 April 2009 at 19:38 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine, good question (to Mike) - maybe Mark has got it right all along with the 'as long as you feel like' advice. I say this because maybe a 'longer' fixed time period (say 30 minutes) creates resisitance? And also because I'm finding that sometimes a task takes a LOT less than first thought, or I may decide after the period of time that I want to keep working on it.

I find that it is best for me to work on some things in spurts.  Take language learning, for example.  I can tune the TV or radio to a Spanish speaking station and just be exposed to it for as long as I like.  However, to actually accomplish something it takes a block of time.  Psychology has gotten a lot of things wrong over the years, but due to the mostly wasted side road taken by the Behaviorists, we did learn a whole ton of  useful things about how the mind learns.  We know that about 2 hours followed by a break, followed by spaced review has been shown to be the most effective way of learning and retaining what has been learned.  Any longer in the study phase is counter productive.  Without a break the subconscious does not have time to the the necessary filing and sorting.  Without the spaced review, the biochemical links are not renewed and reinforced to make the memory long term.  So when I study something, I use what we know works.<br><br>When it comes to something like house cleaning I find that 20 minutes works well.  It also works well for practice kinds of things like music performance.  I can sit and exercise music for 20 minutes and benefit greatly from it.  (If I were having to learn something big, I'd go back to the 2 hour session, though.)<br><br>As to home organization maintenance ... I find that just doing it "little and often" works the best.  I pick up things that are out of place and take them to their home as I cruse from room to room on some other errand.<br><br>Of course, I could define "little and often" as 20 minutes ... and maybe it is, philosophically.  IOW, many long term projects don't get done because we don't have huge blocks of time available.  But we all have 20 minutes we can devote to something every day to make big changes.  Exercise is like this.  20 Minutes a day is more efficacious than an hour or more that is never done because we don't have the time.<br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2009 at 12:17 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon,<br><br> My watch is a "Timex Ironman Triathlon" with Data Link.  It is an older watch ... I think I got it more than 10 years ago ... gee, thinking on it now, maybe it was more like 1982 or something ... I can't really remember.  It cost about $40 or so and the price has remained pretty stable.  Here it is on Amazon:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/Timex-Unisex-Ironman-Triathlon-T54281/dp/B000B545BO">http://www.amazon.com/Timex-Unisex-Ironman-Triathlon-T54281/dp/B000B545BO</a><br><br>The watch shown does not look at all like mine so I don't know what its features are.  You'd have to do your own investigation ;-)  Mine has:<br><br>- Lighted display (push to light or to set to stay on)<br>- Two time zones (12 or 24 hour display)<br>- Hourly Reminder<br>- Chronograph with lap recording (lots of laps)<br>- Five alarm timers (each with option to<br>- - Stop at end<br>- - Repeat<br>- - Start recording time on the chronograph<br>- Ten alarms which can be set to daily or a date (each has a label to remind you why you set it)<br>- A function to sync with software on the computer.<br><br>That last feature no longer works.  Rather it does work but Windows XP broke it by changing how the screen updates so now you have to buy hardware to use it ... and that is just not worth the cost.  It used to be you could enter stuff on a computer application then trigger your watch, and hold it up to the screen and the watch would be updated ... time, alarms, timers, etc.  It was really slick.<br><br>Now they have heart monitors and all of that ... and the watches look like kiddie watches.  LOL ;-)  I like the watch a lot ... it is a lot of bang for the buck ... the most trouble I've had with it was replacing those black plastic bands that break every other year or so.  It goes about three years on a $10 (including labor) battery ... but that all depends on how many alarms you have going off and how much you use the lighted display.  Oh, and my wife bought me a replacement from eBay that lasted less than a year and then crapped out.  I think it was a black market thing so I'd not advise getting them from eBay ... Timex will not honor the warranty.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2009 at 12:21 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon,<br><br>I don't feel resistance based on the time I need to allocate to a task.

I'd rather stay in the cool and drink a beer."  ;-)<br><br>I also would not do a 2 hour task in less than 2 hours as it would not be productive.  Why do it half-assed and not get the result I want?

My egg-timer has been pretty redundant since starting AF in January - I think I've only used it once to keep track of time when working to a tight deadline.  I always found it an excellent tool for beating procrastination but as AF deals with that issue for me it has not been necessary.<br><br>I can understand the concept of the "time requirement" and that sounds like a good approach.  I guess by entering the task in AF in that way you are essentially telling your subconscious that for a language learning type task to stand out you need at least a 2 hour window.  Although it is ignoring the "for as long as you feel like" rule if it is specifically for tasks that "need" that time then that definitely makes sense.  <br><br>Thanks Mike - helpful explanation :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2009 at 12:42 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>Some of my casual tasks involve researching something on the internet ... that takes as long as it takes and I can do as little or as much as I want.  I want to buy a belt sander to refinish my deck and I've been researching on and of in fits and starts.  That is usually O.K.  The problem is in the startup overhead.  I have to get my mind back where I was when I left off and that takes a good 5 or 10 minutes.  So there are tradeoffs.<br><br>But things like "clip the cats' claws" just takes how however long it takes.

I have corresponded with the inventor of this and commented that it would be nice if he could expand the time selections on the Time Machine.  He is working on that and trying to decide how to implement it.  <br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2009 at 14:57 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use <a rel="nofollow" href="http://e.ggtimer.com/">http://e.ggtimer.com/</a> for timeboxing</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2009 at 15:01 | Christian Selvaratnam</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David:<br><br>I think it could be a very useful program indeed if he succeeds in incorporating things like that.

I often found it helpful to estimate length of time for certain tasks but haven't felt much need to do so with AF because of the "for as long as i feel" rule - which is a VERY well used rule in my case!!  It seems from the video, although he did not show it, that you can pause the timers, so could stop "when you feel like" and pick up later ......<br><br>Would be excellent for keeping track of billable time too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2009 at 15:59 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christian:<br><br>I like the fact that you can set the time for any amount of time, from seconds up to days and even weeks.

I have to say I had not investigated further but had assumed it to be a download ..... oh well.
