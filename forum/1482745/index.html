(page one is dissmissed)<br><br>if anyone knows the answer thanks to tell me.

I tried out Todopaper (taskpaper's win version), and I really like the simple UI. I'm really getting into the hang of electronic AF now.  I was using MLO before this.<br><br>The upside of electronic use (the ability to paste notes from the web and hyperlinks that fleshes out a task, especially one requiring information gathering) outweighs the obvious downsides of the reduced speed and immediacy. But with Task/Todopaper's simplicity, this downside is reduced significantly.<br><br>You said &lt;&lt; I grouped all my task UI at the end of each page then it's like a C2 column&gt;&gt;. I don't quite understand how you create C2 from this explanation. Would you care to elaborate?<br><br>At the moment, I have Page 1, Page 2, etc as projects and tasks created under them to replicate a notebook. But just don't get the hang of replicating a C2 column on each page.<br><br>And I love the tags - I use it to identify projects and errands. Its good to have a grouped view at times to have an overall idea of a project or a series of tasks to be done at a specific location.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2011 at 10:22 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi JD "You said &lt;&lt; I grouped all my task UI at the end of each page then it's like a C2 column&gt;&gt;. I don't quite understand how you create C2 from this explanation. Would you care to elaborate?<br><br>&gt; It's indeed simple. Taskpaper aloud a selection by project (Which group tasks and notes) or by Tags (see the video). When I read or create my tasks I write it on my list one by one. Then some tasks UI are in the midle off some others tasks. Mentaly I associate UI with urgent and important ie C2 and usual tasks with C1. If I read the list and see a UI, I just clic on the - XXXXX and drag it at the end of my list and mentaly associates it as a C2 column.<br><br>So the process is simple I read the list without UI it's my C1 column then I arrive to the UI it's my C2 column. <br><br>For the rules I follow MF Rules. a task wich is not finished is usualy tag as UI first then drop to the next page (project) <br><br>I dont use many tags but they help me a lot. Mine are UI, Dismissed (and Plan) Which is for a task or a group of task I put on my diary to do it. Example I must do my acount now after this post I put as an appointment on my diary Account from 1.30 pm to 2.30 pm and look on task paper all relatives tasks which are tags as @PLAN <br><br>Errands doesnt go on SF it goes on omnifocus because I dont have to really do it now or at a very short time and as I have mon iphone everytime with me (not the ipad) when I am outside I can have a quick look to my omnifocus list. <br><br>Omnifocus is also helpfull for the all list of project, for planning tasks ex a future call at a right time for non actionable tasks, for thinking and erasing tasks about projects<br>And I can drag and drop tasks from OF to task paper and erase it on OF as they become actionable. <br><br>The system works very very well. And is fast and easy. <br><br>Don't mistake I love paper, notebook, and pen but taspaper and omnifocus together are indeed powrfull, simple and easy. And its is increble efficient for dismiss. I can erase all tasks about a page at a glance and drag and drop a whole list at a glance too. <br><br>Ouaoouhh I love it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2011 at 12:43 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Jupiter for the detailed explanation. Tags are really easy to set up,  and so emulating C2 in the way you describe it seems quite workable.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 May 2011 at 11:35 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>JD The system works better and better. I try to let it simple the most I can but It's incredible how I feel. For the first time I gone for a ride of bicycle of half an hour during my time work just because my job was done. <br><br>The dismiss rules and the urgent and unfinished rule works perfectly with taskpaper. <br><br>The review, double reading is perfect. <br><br>I was late since today of 3 days of tasks (I put at the begining of my first written daily task today's date) and now I am at today. I am on page 8 without of 9. So I am sure to finish my list tomorrow and the previous pages (one to 7)  are dismissed. <br><br>I think I got it. :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 May 2011 at 18:11 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi all. I report my result after testing the system from may 3 th until 11 th  (9 days). <br><br>The system has some advantage :<br>1. All tasks are synchronized so I can work everywhere ie take notes  on my iphone, my ipad, or my Imac. <br>2. It easy to sort all the tasks about a word such as a name or a project name. <br>3. There is a real control about tasks and a real feeling about the nature of tasks. Ie I noticed i exceptionally reported some tasks even 2 or 3 pages later because I wanted to treat it in 2 or 3 days. I also could put it on my diary, but I was lazy. <br>4. The list is clean and always up to date. <br>5. Dismissing and applying the rules are easy<br><br>The two major inconvenient is about my intuition and the time it takes me on the flow when the activity is hard and rushing. About my intuition, as TP imitated paper, I thought there could be no incidence. I was wrong. there is one. I am less intuitive and I feel less comfortable with the system. About the time it take me paper as said MF is more comfortable and faster. There is also a better control with paper than with digital. <br><br>So as my list was short only one page I came back to my previous paper note book and just reported the new tasks. <br><br>The advantage of this digital try is that it made me discover and understand MF SF rules and the dismissing of pages, much better that if I stayed on paper. <br><br>Anyway, I may conclude by these words. Yes the digital solution TP works and it is easy to do it and to work with. But, for me I feel much comfortable with my paper notebook. Writing it by hand let's me appropriate my stuff so I go faster. But there is one rule I gona respect : My notebook will never leave my office for I don't want to loose it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2011 at 7:51 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I know this is a bit off track but Penultimate recently came out with various new paper templates as backgrounds for their digital notebooks.<br>Here is a nice one for SF:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://erik.sources.jp/post/5450111342/">http://erik.sources.jp/post/5450111342/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2011 at 15:17 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Erik I red your thread and bought Penultimate. <br>My problem was about writing.
