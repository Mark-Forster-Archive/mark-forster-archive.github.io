But Superfocus mitigates the slow movement somewhat.  If I move slowly, then column2 tends to fill up.  This forces me to action or dismiss everything in column1, and action everything in column2.  This prevents you from clogging things up on too large a scale -- the blockage gets cleared out pretty quickly.<br><br>Thus, SF is somewhat self-regulating, much more so than Autofocus, and that's a good thing.  <br><br>However, I have found SF's "you must action column2" approach creates some resistance if I run into that problem too often.  And that leads to gaming the system. Instead of writing unfinished tasks in column2, I may be tempted to say, "well, it's done for NOW, so I'll put it in column1 on the last page", when I would have been more naturally inclined to put it in column2 on the next page.   Likewise with urgent tasks, when I'd be more naturally inclined to write them down in column2, I am tempted to "wing it" and just try to get it done without writing it down -- which leads to some urgent tasks never getting done because they tend to come in batches and I can't keep them all in my head, and also leads to distractions because once I'm away from my list I tend to stay away.  <br><br>Also, if I am already struggling, maybe not feeling well, maybe having a too-busy day with too many meetings or whatever, and I see my column2 getting filled up -- and the next page's column2 ALSO filling up -- just looking at all those tasks that I *MUST* action can create resistance.   It's easier just to close the book and go read the forums for awhile.  <br><br>For me personally, following the "standing out" rules and strictly following all the processing rules, I do NOT necessarily get through my list at least once a day.  It seems this "get through the list at least once a day" is another "rule" that needs to be incorporated somehow.<br><br>None of these things have been a HUGE issue, but they have caused me a bit of trouble here and there.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 February 2011 at 23:22 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>As I've said in my response to your posting on another thread, this self-correction is a characteristic of SF. But in order for it to work you must stick to the rules.<br><br>It's been said several times in other threads that this system really forces you to think about what you put on your list. <br><br>Although I encourage getting through the system once a day as good practice, I don't think it should be a rule. The system is self-correcting to the extent that it will tend to push people to the correct speed. After all, no one except me has had this system for longer than 10 days - you have to give your list time to mature.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 0:26 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>OK, like I answered on the other thread, I'll take it on faith that this effect will become clearer over time, as you have said, and I'll stick to your advice, follow the rules strictly as written and see how it goes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 5:16 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is weird and interesting, I go through my list about 5 times a day... All the rules are up kept and I don't believe I do more or less work then the average person. I do however chunk up my tasks when I put them in so that there are only a few "un-finished" things in the second column. I really must raise my hat again to you Mark: while GTD is good to identify and organize things, Autofocus (and in this instance Superfocus) is good at making things happen!

It's my own fault. But I'd love advice as to what I could have/should have done differently. <br><br>I'm on vacation (at home) this week trying to get stuff done around the house. I've made great strides cleaning, organizing etc. What I've not made progress on is some more business-y type phone calls that I need to get done (insurance, investments, etc.) Last night I realized that with only two more 'work days' this week, I best get on those, so I made the three tasks in question urgent. They, and several other things, are now in C2 of my current page. <br><br>All morning I've been sort of paralyzed because it's been too early to make these phone calls. I've done some of the other C2 things, but still others have to wait for something else to fall in line. I recall Mark's response to someone who'd left work and couldn't do something in C2 because they were no longer in the right place. I feel that's true (in one form or the other) of several things in C2 right now. <br><br>Was I wrong to move them to C2? <br><br>I feel like I need something in-between promoting something to urgent and leaving it down on page 4 or 5. Maybe this still stems from my first couple days when I was stuck on one page. Maybe I'd have gotten to these things today and not felt paralyzed by them if I'd left them in their original positions. It's ironic that by pulling them all up to urgent I've, once again, clogged up my flow and I'm stuck like I was those first couple days. <br><br>Thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 18:24 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Malisa:<br><br>Basically I only regard something as "urgent" if I need or want to do it within the time I'm on the current page. <br><br>I don't put things in Column 2 just because I need to do them today. <br><br>So what I would have done with those phone calls was only enter them in Col 2 when it was time to do them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 19:21 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think there's a misuse here. <br>If it's to go in C2, it's either urgent or unfinished, but with respect to these nuances:<br><br>urgent: it should be worked on in the next hour because later than that would be bad. Further, you are now able to work on it. <br><br>Unfinished: you define for each task what part needs to be accomplished before you consider yourself done-for-now. That definition is what you write in C2. Until you reach that point, you do some and reenter in the next column 2. If you *can* no longer work the item at present, you are,de facto, done-for-now.  To C1 it goes. <br><br>Now if something was stuck and set aside, and if (eg) an email comes to unstuck it, and it's urgent, use the urgency rule, and the trigger of the email to reinstate it.  <br><br>It's important to keep the above terms narrowly defined to keep the flow.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 19:25 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks. I'm going to write 'done-for-now' on a post it and keep it on the page where I'm adding things. :) <br><br>And the 'do in tne next hour' and 'do before I leave this page' guidelines should help too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 19:49 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Alan Baljeu<br><br>I have to say, your definitions of urgent and unfinished really, REALLY clarified some things for me.

YMMV.<br><br>I do a large majority of my work for clients much of which arrives as "urgent" to the client. And that work involves usually 30minutes to 2 hours of net effort spread over 1-2 days. When I start doing my part the tasks moves from column 1 to column 2 per the rules.<br><br>However at the end of most of my tasks is communicate with the client to close out the issue, train the client; or get more info from the client to clear a roadblock etc.  <br><br>Often times the client isn't available or is slow to respond.  When I hit those instances I now ask myself if the task is still urgent; or is it just active. If it's not urgent but active I will now return it to column 1 as it really is a different task at that point. This assures me I will follow up again on the later passes through the list but it prevents my column 2 from choking with issues that I can't move forward because they are in a wait for customer state.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 February 2011 at 20:23 | Bob Pankratz</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
