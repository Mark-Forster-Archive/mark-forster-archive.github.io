You read it everywhere: choose imperfect system which works for you and stick to it. Do not waste your time by hacking your system... and I know that we need to apply certain limits on how much we focus on system hacking to avoid pitfall of "productivism" (=procrastinating by focusing on tweaking productivity systems instead of being productive) . <br><br>BUT<br><br>Maybe switching systems could also have positive role:<br><br>- sense of freshness (like wearing new clothes)<br>- reduction of blind spots (when using every system, after some time you can subconsciously find your ways how to *avoid* important tasks/hide them in your system/misuse system in favour of more pleasant tasks)<br>- new passion (habituation has not occurred yet)<br>- accommodation to new life/work/project/mental conditions<br>etc etc.<br><br>Maybe changing system from time to time could be beneficial. Maybe rotating two or three well-tried systems. Maybe deliberate introduction of new rule/feature/app/pen from time to time. Maybe choosing one of well-tried system to match your current workload (holidays, types of projects...).<br><br>I do not say that changing/tweaking systems should be the *main* focus of our productivity. But who told us that we have to stay stable/inflexible in THIS area? Why we want to? Could this search for "final system" be too extreme opposite reaction to extreme (and harmful) trend of tweaking our systems continually?<br><br>I will appreciate your thoughts.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2014 at 9:03 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It is a well-known phenomenon that each time one changes to a new system (provided it is not a bad one), productivity tends to increase for some time after the change. Then it often diminishes again, for all kinds of reasons. Unless you stumbled on the system that is the perfect match for your personality...<br><br>Based on this, if I wanted to be cynical (who, me? never!), I could conclude that the best way to remain productive is to change systems every few months, whatever system you choose. Which of course is what some of us tend to do anyway, although in our case it is in the interest of advancing the science of time/task management ;o)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2014 at 12:41 | Marc (from Brussels)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi All<br>To me, how I define my system might be different than how others define theirs.  My work "system" is largely for the purpose of knowing what's on my plate and arranged so that it's easy to have an overview which makes decisions and strategies easy for me to process and make decisions.  Of course, I have several life rules and habits that take away much of the guess work or decision making over and over.  Where the work doesn't easily fit ongoing habits, it's nice to have my overview/system to help me decide how to meet my responsibilities and how to progress my ambitions. This is my bedrock of security. By keeping pace with my responsibilities and ambitions in an overall timely manner, that sets my mind and emotions free for my leisure time.  I can use it however I like.  Sometimes people might think I'm hard at work during my leisure time building a piece of furniture or producing a painting but to me it's not work even if I get paid for it.  Other times my passion may be to spend the extra time to make homemade bread.  I couldn't fully enjoy these times if I didn't have a system to help me meet my responsibilities and develop my aspirations.<br><br>Because I need to overcome resistance, I use workarounds.  They may seem like unique processes or games but they overlay the trusted system.  I may roll the dice, draw cards, alternate this job from that job, whatever it takes to finish my day's work.  What never changes is how I use and read my calendar, how I organize my action book, how I organize and file my work, my "proof", my reference materials and my archives.  I always know where my sissors are, what's in the green files, where to reach to get anything or look up something.  Those things don't change.  I review often and since everything's ordered, it doesn't take long to plan my week or change the plan.  It's so much easier for me to know where everything is and why it's ordered that way, especially my work.  If I was a robot I wouldn't need workarounds.  Unfortunately I'm not always sensible so I need to have workarounds to keep me accomplishing my work as best as I can.  I like not having to worry about where things are, simple habits that are almost invisibly woven into the day's activities, knowing how my work is ordered in my calendar and work book and the ritual of setting up the supplies and files for today's work. Then I look at my list and feel that dread creeping in as I focus on THAT particular job or THAT particular chore. The only decision I have to make is which workaround to use. Then I need to harness my determination and get on with it as best as I can muster.  At least I don't worry about learning an entire new system.  I only have to get the work done. There's no learning curve outside what the jobs themselves demand of me.  I'd like to have enough physical and cognitive energy left over after my work to enjoy my leisure time or use the time for a project that excites or challenges me.  I suppose that my mental and physical energy is limited. My time is also limited.  That's why I like to get my required work done as soon possible to open up the rest of day or week for what I want to do.  All my system does really is allowing me to know what's on my plate to provide an overview and where to find what I need.  After the decisions are made on what to do and in the week's time frame, I just need to make sure that I actually do the work in a decent, timely fashion.  I really don't care how I get it done, just work the list, roll the dice, time box....just get it done.  I never did like rules much...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2014 at 14:54 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>Fingers crossed that this isn't my last post.

That was when they needed to move to different tools/techniques to continue their journey.<br><br>So if one was having trouble with a particular tool/technique, it may be that that tool is more advanced, less advanced, overdeveloped, not right for your situation, or not right for you at this stage in your growth. One way around the problem was to go back to earlier tools that maybe didn't work then, but worked better now since the person had acquired more self-knowledge/skills. No one tool could do the complete job for every person.<br><br>And of course, when learning any new tool, there are start-up costs, conscious incompetence, etc. <br><br>I find myself liking to change things now and then just to freshen things up. As long as I don't knock out the supporting walls (a calender, reminder system, list of tasks I'm obligated to provide).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2014 at 19:51 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>I agree it would be necessary to use one list / one app. For switching the systems, it could be regular (weekly) OR (what I would prefer as I think about it) it could be more autofocus-like: use system/rules which "stand-out". Change when you feel "done" (= system is not working so well any more). <br><br>Mike:<br><br>Good point. For clarification, I realized that I still used the SAME types of methods/rules and I rotated them (and of course they somehow evolve) rather than using new and new methods in line. With exception of randomness, which is new. <br><br>I am using final version for a while. Randomness for a while. Priority-ordered selection for a while. Resistance-based selection for a while. In fact, I work similarly to learning-as-I-go: relatively stable method for organizing tasks (task list/project lists and new daily todo list every morning) + rotating methods to work with the daily todo list (or less often, with bigger general task list)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2014 at 21:06 | Daneb</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
