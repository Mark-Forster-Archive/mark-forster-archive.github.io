I had to separate the rules threads because they are different rules, and I thought it would be confusing to discuss both rules in the same thread.  Nevertheless, effective use of the system is the same for both, so this thread is for that discussion.<br><br>Tip 1: Start conservatively.  Most things do not need to be organized into projects.  If you never make a project page, you're just running your choice of AutoFocus, and we all know that works quite well.  If you make one project page, you are *still* running AutoFocus, with only a slight deviation when you step aside to work on that one project.<br><br>Tip 2: One benefit from moving things into projects, is that you don't see numerous tasks from a project you're not working on.  One negative is you don't see the tasks as much unless you work on those projects.  On balance I'm finding it beneficial to create more and more, but you need to review them so things don't get forgotten.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 November 2010 at 17:55 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I tend to write in parenthesis major tasks of the projects I list in DWM.xls. For example: "Work on BCC (new AM's JD, update PMR)". This make some of the tasks in the project directly visible in DWM.xls list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 November 2010 at 6:58 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good idea sabre!<br><br>Tip 3: Always write everything to the main list first, unless you are currently working on a project.  It's less disruptive.  When you go to work on the task, if you decide you it isn't ready to be worked on, THEN put it away to a project (and pick out something that is ready instead).<br><br>Tip 4: Warning: The project mechanism subtly bypasses the AutoFocus dismissal process.  (In the beginning it's not a problem because everything is organized, and the number is small, and your main list is small too!)  Therefore, consider everything that enters a project to be effectively dismissed already, UNLESS the project itself or its next action is in your list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 November 2010 at 22:48 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I haven't seen much response here.  Are you guys interested in organizing work like this?<br><br>As for me, I started organizing ideas to do a year ago.  I didn't manage any of it though, so stuff got ignored.  (But I wasn't ready to work on it either, and it wasn't urgent, so all's well.)<br><br>In August I began this system for managing stuff, and that's been working great.  <br><br>Now I'm committing to tackle the backlog of accumulated projects.  I've got a focusing system going that will bring in a few old projects at a time, to work on or dismiss stuff.  I expect to convert the current backlog into a small but managed collection, and finally get *everything* done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 December 2010 at 18:47 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>Indeed, yes, I am!  <br><br>I was going to put up a post about having been intrigued by so many people on this forum, in addition to Mark of course, and inspired by your development and comments.<br><br>Despite having waxed and waned over the last two years, I have at least become better at recording and doing all manner of things ie the Autofocus theme has been consistent.<br><br>One of my many issues is I'm easily distracted and some progress that should have been made towards getting some things, if not everything done, has not been as much as I would have liked. ie like you, 'stuff got ignored'!<br><br>While I have much of today's technology at my finger-tips, I have not been resolute enough to make it pay off.  But thanks to your description of using OneNote effectively for work only, and staying with paper at home (correct?), I sat down this week and mapped out how I could do DWM2 for me with OneNote 2010.<br><br>This morning I started building the Work List on OneNote and using some of the tips in your recent and earlier posts.  I hope it's not just the novelty factor, but I can already sense a growing feeling of control because of the ease in which I can link and embed work-related stuff into OneNote and have a dynamic record of progress without too much duplication of effort.<br><br>For example, in my section 'group' for AF/DWM I have set up sections to capture and to focus on the tasks in a similar way you recently described, I think (!):<br><br>NOW TODAY<br>SOON<br>TASK LIST - this is where everything is captured from the start. I just set it up with incomplete or untouched tasks from the paper work list I was using until yesterday and which I will still use now and again, but less so with nearly everything in OneNote.<br>Completed<br>Dismissed<br>LTBW<br>Someday Maybe<br><br>Already I have seen the power of the hyper-links you mentioned.  The page (sub-page actually, under each date) notes, file links etc,  But I just put the hyper-link to a task when I decide to have it appear on NOW TODAY, then it takes me back to the original page for adding the current things to it, notes, reminders for next time.<br><br>I'm under no illusions, my track record isn't great and I have to fine tune things so that re-entered tasks (= unfinished task however that task was defined) can appear in the right place when the clock starts running down on it towards dismissal, if not before.<br><br>But this the first digital hybrid that has resonated with me, it does not have too much overhead, yet, still allows me to focus per the various rules.<br><br>Now I'm setting up the project sections like your tip 2, more later.<br><br>Thanks again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 December 2010 at 11:52 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;using OneNote effectively for work only, and staying with paper at home (correct?)&gt;<br>Yes.<br><br>&lt;I sat down this week and mapped out how I could do DWM2 for me with OneNote 2010.&gt;<br><br>With DWM2 you need to put new and re-entered tasks on the same date, and distinguish those with a mark.

Yes, I used your technique already, hence Completed and Dismissed.<br><br>Because I like a focus on the really critical and important stuff, I liked the 3T (Three Tasks) approach from earlier incarnations, so NOW TODAY contains a handful of tasks hyperlinked so that I can build up progress on the 'original/feeder' page in TASK LIST as I work on them.<br><br>SOON is not yet populated, thought I might want to have those tasks lurking around the corner, but not needed TODAY.  There is an inherent danger of trying to prioritise by doing this (beyond a 3T element), so I may drop this for now ie 'simplify'!<br><br>LTBW: Let The B*****d Wait, for things others would like me to do which maybe should be done, possibly beyond the 28 days of my DWM scope, but which I don't feel like putting on the list even on day 28.  At the same time, I don't want to 'lose' it by putting it in Outlook  as a reminder task, yet.<br><br>SOMEDAY MAYBE: my tag for a 'Grasscatcher', but stuff that occurs to me which I would like to do.<br><br>&lt;&lt;Already I have seen the power of the hyper-links you mentioned.

But my preference is to embed information in the page. It's much more immediate and powerful.&gt;<br><br>I'm only really looking at hyperlinks so far for linking back to the main task list, but other links go into the original page if they are important resources or references, such as an Excel-based financial model or Visio graphic.  There is a caveat here which hit me this afternoon, I'll try and explain later after I've investigated the linking/embedding thing a bit more.<br><br><br>As for subpages under each date, that seems like a fine approach.<br><br>(Optional detail: One thing I would do: I would split the DWM list across multiple sections, only so the list of pages in each section fits the screen.

I'll see how I get on, but I can see there could be problems if tasks are scrolled out of sight.<br><br>A luta continua.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 December 2010 at 15:20 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very good then.  <br><br>I never tried 3T but I'd suggest: rather than link to a page, move the page to 3T.  If you're committed to actually working the page, it will have to move anyway when you're done.<br><br>For LTBW, Someday, I recommend this:  Always throw *everything* in the DWM list.  (No thinking required.) Any time you decide you don't want to see something, move the item out.  If you decide then you want it in LTBW or Someday, put it there.  Only make sure Review Someday and Review LTBW are in your list as per the project system instructions.  (They aren't projects in the ordinary sense of the word, but the system treats all lists the equally well so I recommend it.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 December 2010 at 15:54 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>The beauty of TT is you only need two lists.  The TT list and capture list.  Capture will include someday/maybe, soon etc and anything else.  The TT list is really the now list, since you work it most of the time.  I tend to focus on the TT list and doing things versus dismissal and other rules.  When I am hunting for tasks, I may cross something off the capture list.  What I find is working with less rules is refreshing, as our minds know what we need to get done but when we overload them, productivity slows.  So, the main rule to focus on three tasks keeps me fresh and productive.  Best of luck<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 December 2010 at 16:59 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yep.  Simple is good.  Simpler is better.<br>But things can get lost in a really long list, which is why I suggest organizing things.  I don't find Someday or LTBW very compelling categories, but Roger does.  Regardless, it gets stuff off that list you're scanning 10 times a day, making the whole thing run smoother.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 December 2010 at 21:57 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like the idea of keeping projects and their associated tasks in a separate area. I switched from an electronic to a paper based system and have listed my projects by the month on an accordion fold out calendar. I whittled down my 25 GTD steps to 4 milestones that I track. This new year I think I will maintain the monthly format but move to a notebook with monthly tabs. <br><br>Do you keep separate home and work projects lists?<br><br>I also enter recurring tasks on in AF in the following manner. Weekly Office 1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and have an index card with the items listed. When I see the task Weekly office I pull out the index card and work on one or more tasks crossing off those I have completed. This saves space and writing time. It also gives me an easy visual at the end of the week of what I did not accomplish.<br><br>How do you set up home projects? Do you just list them or put them in categories?<br><br>Thanks</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 December 2010 at 23:01 | Jennifer B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan, Gerry,<br><br>I agree that one needs to capture everything and preferably on one place (list, OneNote section, whatever) , under extreme time pressure, I may write down a LTBW task into the DWM2 list, but will then move it to LTBW, or perhaps Someday Maybe, later during a scan.<br><br>Yes, I have got Reviews for the LTBW along with Someday/Maybe as a recurring task in the main list.  As Alan mentions, it keeps the main working list shorter and smoother.<br><br>I'm finding this especially the case with my new OneNote Approach for Work tasks, no more rewriting, just drag the individual task page into LTBW, Someday, Dismissed, and helpfully a lot more into Completed!<br><br>I can see OneNote handling Mark's latest AF4 revision easily enough, but for now I want to keep it a la DWM2 with project tasks feeding the main list per Alan's approach.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 December 2010 at 10:41 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jennifer, could you try to explain your approach differently?  I'm not following. I don't know what you mean by "25 GTD steps", or "4 milestones" or listing projects by month, or your weekly office card.<br><br>To answer your question, I have a binder with one page per project.  I sort them alphabetically.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 December 2010 at 13:05 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Roger J,<br><br>I settled on just two lists because I like simplicity and in reality you have two types of tasks, things you are going to do today and things you are not going to do today.  I did not feel the need to categorize what I was not planning to do today.  I find that my mind knows what is rising to the top and needs to be done, the purpose of the capture list is simply to give me the peace of mind that "everything" is captured.<br><br>The idea for me in TT is to get more efficient by minimizing rules and lists and focusing on completing batches of two to three tasks.  For me lots of rules and lists is a distraction, but that is of course just me.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 December 2010 at 15:53 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm not so sure my system is rigid as it may seem.<br><br>I just want to get some things away from cluttering my work, but without resorting to a 1 -2 - 3 priority system.<br><br>There's nothing that prevents me, if the mood takes me, to looking at the other lists to see if I might really want to do them instead.<br><br>As you say, that's just me ;-))))<br><br>R</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 December 2010 at 16:32 | Roger J</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
