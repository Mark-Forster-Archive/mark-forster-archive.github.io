Wrap into a loop and clip your pencil in. Then work out where on the book to attach it and use another piece of duct tape to secure it.  I've done this in the past, it works.  You can also cut a piece out of the first strip to leave a sticky section at each end after folding and attach it directly. Duct tape is ace!

Urgent items are marked with a 'U' (or other symbol) at either side of the task, preferably to the right. These can be done at any time and in any order. <br>3.

You can get quiver holders at www.quiverglobal.com.  They are a FANTASTIC price and look/feel great.<br><br>FYI, i have absolutely no connection with either company.  I just love their products.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Brett</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 December 2011 at 8:16 | brettypooh</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like the Uniball 207:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/uni-ball-Retractable-Medium-Point-Colored-40110/dp/B000FD5818">http://www.amazon.com/uni-ball-Retractable-Medium-Point-Colored-40110/dp/B000FD5818</a><br>there are several colors and sizes and it's readily available (at least in US)<br><br>But the Pilot G2 is a close second.  the Micro doesn't write as smooth as a 207 micro but it does make a finer line.
