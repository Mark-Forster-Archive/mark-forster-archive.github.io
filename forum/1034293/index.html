My #1 struggle is finding a low maintenance time tracking (for motivation, mindfulness &amp; weekly evaluation &amp; task/project management system. The complexity has to do with the tools more than the system. I was using DWM with Omnifocus &amp; Eternity timer iPhone app. Omnifocus sync is SLOW (iPhone to software) and it was a pain to start/stop the timer in Eternity. <br><br>This week, I'm moving away from DWM, AF, etc., and using Toggl to monitor my project/task activity. I will have a list of all my open projects/tasks, and go through the list using intuition, fear... whatever, choose a task/project, and time the activity. <br><br>I'm looking to increase my flow/spontaneity as well as mindfulness (where is my time going). <br><br>Looking forward to the results (Friday).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2010 at 1:58 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It has done it's job for me.  In my work, it's helped me stay focused.  And for personal, it's helped me realize how totally overcommitted I am.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2010 at 4:52 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great question, Alan. I was on the point of posting a question to Mark asking if he'd got good feedback on his DWM "alpha test and what changes, if any, would appear in the final version. <br><br>My status: I'm not getting through the list fast enough. However, I think I can see where I'm going wrong...<br><br>Probably because of that, I'm not getting focus out of the system itself. I need to stick a list of my high level focus areas into the system to remind me what I'm aiming for and make sure I'm not neglecting anything.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2010 at 7:04 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  it was a pain to start/stop the timer in Eternity.   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Now see, that is what I'm experiencing as well.  Not so much that it is a "pain" but that I just don't seem to be able to be aware of when I'm switching contexts.  I mean, how hard is it to pull the iPhone out of my pocket, and press a couple of buttons?  I have all my TM apps on the first page of icons so everything I need is on ONE page.  I don't see "difficulty" as the problem.  If I had one of those Star Treck computers that I could just talk to I'd STILL have the problem.  The problem is ME, not the iPhone or the app.  I'll enter one context (like sleep, for example) then the next time I think about it (I realize that I'm watching TV or doing housework, for example) I'll click Eternity and see that I've been sleeping for 37 hours!  WTF?  It is not so much that I need to know where I spend my time, that is going to be very helpful, of course, but that I am not AWARE.<br><br>I'm not willing to give up on Eternity.  I have to draw a line somewhere and being AWARE of my context ... really that I am CHANGING contexts ...is so basic to TM that to fail at that simple thing is unacceptable.<br><br>I look at it this way: before you can change anything, you have to be aware of where you are, where you want to go, and what steps need to be taken ... then monitor how well you are doing.  That is pretty basic change theory, right?  All control is a negative feedback loop.  Simple operations research stuff.  So if I can't get past knowing when I am changing context, how am I EVER going to be able to affect ANY other change?  It is like the pilot not being aware he is going off course because he does not think to look at the compass.  I don't do that when I fly.  I don't do that when I drive.  How can I accept that situation and give up on recording the context switches everywhere else in my life?  That is the very name of my whole issue with TM in the first place.<br><br>I don't know what I'm going to do to change this situation, but SOMETHING must change.  In a way I'm glad that I hit this wall.  I think I've finally been able to understand the crux of the problem.  At least it seems that way to me.  My time management problems have NOTHING at all to do with what kind of list I use or how I process the items on it (forward, back, in loops ... whatever).  My TM problem is that I don't know what the hell I'm doing half the time.  Harsh, but I have GOT to see it that way.<br><br>I've seen this with smoking and weight loss clients.  I've just never put it together for myself as I don't have "those problems".  Smokers will complan that they can't stop smoking because they don't notice that they light a smoke until they are half way through smoking it.  Those with eating issues say they don't even realize when they are eating until it is too late.  Sheesh ... this is the same damn thing!<br><br>Awareness is the very first step.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2010 at 11:21 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good question Mike but I don't want to derail this thread so I'm posting about this in a new thread.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2010 at 13:16 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Back to the subject: I've found DWM workable but not to my liking.  My home system (which is pure dwm) does its job fine but it puts daily pressure on me when I'd do much better without that pressure.   I don't need or want to be told I must do 4 things today or else.  AF4 suited me much better. <br><br>My work system was following dwm until I dropped the D, but that only improved things slightly. In this case, I already have plenty of pressure, including artificial and concrete deadlines which it turns out really don't blend well with dwm. I also found sticking projects on the list didn't work because they never finish and over time I have more and more projects on my "do some this week" plate and I couldn't focus. I also didn't like the long undifferentiated list cycling or the automatic activation of tasks by the calendar. <br><br>My motive to try dwm was it seemed like the task activation (moving new stuff forward to +7) would help focus better than af4's moving active tasks backward to the open list. It has, but not well enough to my taste.  I'm switching to a hybridized AF5 system for work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2010 at 20:37 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>DWM seems to be working rather well for me, at least whilst my work is reasonably under control.  Or my work seems to be under control because DWM is working rather well.  I'm not too sure which it is yet but I'm hopeful, because DWM also seems to be working well for my personal list.  So far the system's not been tested by a manically busy spell, but for now it's good.  <br><br>At first I decided not to switch to DWM as it sounded and felt strange, but was increasingly drawn to the calendar idea and its potential to mesh with the deadlines and scheduled nature of work.  After a false start, I've used a week-at-a-view version of DWM, plus a 'must do this week' list (drawn from days 8-28) for nearly 4 weeks.  I'm still getting used to working with the system but I'm more and more impressed as I continue. The combination of a calendar structure for the list of things to do, and the re-entry of work in progress at +1 week, plus clear MITs for the week, really turn it in to a practical and powerful tool to guide focus in my fragmented unscheduled time. <br><br>There is some pressure to do some work on everything on this week's list but succeeding with this, and the fact that work is spread out over the coming month, reduce the more generalised feeling of stress and unease arising from having a long 'backlog' list of work I could never catch up with.  For the first time ever, I have a sense that I am keeping up with my work.  I'm aware that this may turn out to be a false dawn, and all may all fall apart in another few weeks, but for now I'm enjoying it.  Many thanks to Mark and to forum contributors for your ideas.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2010 at 21:59 | Jane P</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm happy with DWM.<br><br>I like that things are moving forward in all areas.<br><br>My creative life (my art work) and my job life (my work-work) are complicated so I keep my systems simple.<br><br>I'm using OmniFocus because I need, and love, the ability to sync to my iPhone.<br><br>Here's my screenshot:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/culturalworker/4415215810/in/pool-autofocustimesystem">http://www.flickr.com/photos/culturalworker/4415215810/in/pool-autofocustimesystem</a><br><br>I just do single action lists for each date, e.g. 04 07 is the list I created today. If you look at my screen shot in the FLICKR group, you'll see I have a folder that's called DWM and when I use that view all of my dated folders are expanded and listed oldest first (which is how I prefer).<br><br>The other folders are checklists and project notes. I categorize and color code my life (!). Orange for teach; green for Make and blue for Life and those other folders reflect those divisions.<br><br>I don't bother with contexts, due dates or anything else although I sometimes add a note to a task.<br><br>I use iCal for hard deadlines.<br><br>I use time blocking (studio time, for example, may be marked out on my calendar) to help me move along my studio projects. But, when I need to prepare something for a deadline, or a task needs to be done before other things can be done, then it goes on my DWM list.<br><br>My teaching is also time-blocked in the sense that I know where I'll be and what I'll be doing Mon-Wed-Fri mornings and afternoons.<br><br>So, I don't put "teach Vis Lit" on the list but I do put "grade project X" or "revise ABC lecture".<br><br>Similarly, I don't put appointments or meetings or application deadlines on my DWM list but I do put "Prep for meeting with Z" or "Work on X application" on the list.<br><br>BTW, I usually find that 20 minutes or so is the minimum I will spend to move a task forward. Anything less would be crazy making for me.<br><br>I set alarms to help me work on distasteful tasks I resistent to start and also to pull me out of obsessively continuing with tasks I love.<br><br>It's all quite boring and without drama.

Part of this was that I did really love AF4 - it spoke to me IMMEDIATELY.<br><br>I felt like the learning curve for DWM was greater than the other systems, probably because of the two entry points for tasks (and I still sometimes mess this up, but I don't worry about it too much).  After a week or 10 days, though, I had it figured out.<br><br>Now working DWM is as habitual as AF4 was and I think I like the date-based dismissal more than the previous methods.  If I know that there's something high-priority somewhere in the middle of the list, I don't worry that I have to touch stuff early in the list to keep it active - I can skim over it quickly and come back to it, for example, after I've prepped for that day's teaching.<br><br>I am usually a day or two "ahead" of dismissal, which has allayed my fears about weekends when I often don't work my list in any systematic way.<br><br>I just snapped a couple of pics of my notebook and put them in the AF flickr pool, starting with this one:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahmichelef/4419233309/in/pool-autofocustimesystem/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahmichelef/4419233309/in/pool-autofocustimesystem/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2010 at 14:08 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sarah,<br><br>The photo is private so we can't access it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 March 2010 at 14:55 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Huh, it's supposed to show up once it's in the group but maybe that's only if you're a Flickr member / group member.

I haven't missed more than that, so it's been working well this way.<br><br>I've managed to get some stuff done that I'd been procrastinating on for months, keep up with my current progress, and decide that some tasks/projects weren't important enough to do right now and dismiss them.<br><br>I've managed to mostly keep 2-3 days "ahead" of dismissal, and even when I haven't, it's worked out ok.
