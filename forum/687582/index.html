However, now that this notebook has been going for a week, I find the twos pages on one thing to be a bit annoying.  So I am starting to go back to viewing every 40 lines as a unit.<br><br>The main difference I find with this is there are many more tasks to do on each page before none stand out.  Over time, the pages still get dismissed, and I move through all my tasks.  I guess it helps me dismiss tasks a bit easier, as by that time, I have had lots of opportunities to select them.<br><br>I have read a number of posts on too few lines, but does anyone see any big issues with too many lines?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 12:31 | DrCris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Chris,<br><br>The only issue I have with too many lines is that it slows progress through the list ... IOW, it can take longer to get to other pages.  You might consider implementing a rule that forces you to move to other pages more quickly such as doing no more than X items on a page before moving on to the next page if that becomes a problem for you.<br><br>My rule of thumb is that I must review the entire list at least once a day.  I do this by a defined review period where I JUST review the whole list (all pages) with no intent at all to do anything.  Then if I see any gotchas on the list I cull them to a Post-it so they will be in my face that day and I'll not rely on serendipity to get me to the page they are on.<br><br>Of course, if I did ONLY one item on each page and then was FORCED to go to the next page, I could probably safely ignore that review process.  The review process has the advantage of priming the subconscious ... however it tends to lead to prioritizing which is more against the spirit of the rules of AF than adding the rule to do no more than an arbitrary number of tasks on a page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 13:10 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello, If i do understand well you question you have too many items and you wish yo know how you can deal with them.<br><br>Mark has a very interesting point about that. There must be no much more 25/35 items per page. I had this difficultie when i began autofocus. I had a lot of items because i reported a lot a task from omnifocus to autofocus. So i wrote on my blog <a rel="nofollow" href="http://gtdway.blogspot.com/">http://gtdway.blogspot.com/</a> in french how i found a solution and in english on the forum of omnifocus. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://forums.omnigroup.com/showpost.php?p=55942&amp;postcount=16">http://forums.omnigroup.com/showpost.php?p=55942&amp;postcount=16</a><br><br>But after one more week of testing i realised than this solution doesnt work very well. I had to test the method to understand really why i did things like that or not and works for me efficiently. <br><br>So i went back to the basic Mark method and now it's OK.<br><br>My advice would be keep it as simple as possible. No context. No Color. May be a due date if there is one, abd NO PRIORITY. But every thing watever may be if and only if it is a task I mean actionable or not. Then work on your last page (the active one). Little by little all the system will be regulate by itself. All highlighted items will be the non actionable items or the dismissed until you decide to cross definitivly this items.<br><br>If you are afraid to forget important things with are on the previous pages just report them on the last page and cross them. I admit like Mark I often do the contrary. <br><br>There is something strange i still dont believe in autofocus. As you put all tasks lttle by little without making any priority you focus on the outcome and your instinct goes straight to the point. More i think that our brain as a natural pleasure to make things complicated. <br><br>With AF you can only write "see the film ..." A SIMPLE PURPOUS. with means a lot of substaks such as pick my wife, the chidren, pick the car, make a reservation, find a parking and be there at 6PM... All that substacks are includes in your item '"see the film..." because your brain works like an automatical pilot for this kind of tasks. <br><br>So little by little there will be less and less of tasks until you have just the necessary for your own activity.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 13:28 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter:<br><br>Well of course you wouldn't put "See the film" in AF if you're talking about going to a cinema because that's a time-specific task.<br><br>What you could put as a task is "Book the film" or "Decide when to go to film" or "Ask my wife what date would suit her to see film".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2009 at 13:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Mike.  I think the idea of reviewing the list once a day is a good one, and pretty helpful.  I will try with a smaller notebook next time, but I am happy to stay with this now.  Part of the problem with splitting the pages was that I would resist dismissing the pages if I saw tasks I liked below the line.<br><br>Using the traditional page by page structure helps me to be more disciplined, and make those tough decisions about dismissing pages.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 March 2009 at 1:35 | DrCris</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
