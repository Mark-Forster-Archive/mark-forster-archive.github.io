We are being reminded that a "zero balance" is what we're aiming for. Ie: "x" amount of money will come in this month, know where it will go (ALL of it). Bills, savings, spending money, etc...<br>It has occured to me that this is what all time management methods are trying to do. We have "x" amount of time each day. Do we know where it will be spent? This isn't to say every 15 minute time block can be pre-determined, but maybe there is something in this idea...<br>Could money budgeting methods have any positive implications for time?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2018 at 3:35 | Marco</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>No. <br><br>First, not all time is equal. Energy levels, environmental factors a vastly different for each slice of time. <br><br>Second, unlike money, time is not a resource, meaning something that can be managed. Time flows in one direction, you cannot stop it, you cannot save it, you don't even know how much you have. It's very different from resources, which are things that can be managed in the classical sense of the word.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2018 at 13:32 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christopher:<br><br>On the other hand you can manage what you do with your time, just as you can manage what you do with the money, fuel, personnel, vehicles, etc at your disposal. And if all these things have been budgeted for the current year with no possibility of change, then time is a very similar resource.<br><br>If you take on more work than you have time to do it, then you will build up a time debt just as if you buy more things than you have money to pay for you will build up a money debt.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2018 at 14:38 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree that time debt is a real thing. It usually (always?) takes the form of backlogs. So there are many parallels between getting out of monetary debt, and getting out from under backlogs. There are parallels in how the debt drains your energy and is a psychological burden. There are also parallels in the psychological process of breaking free of it.<br><br>I think the biggest difference is that you can manage how much each time debt actually "costs". You can't do that with money.<br><br>Let's say you have credit card debt and a mortgage. You are in debt to a specific amount, under specific terms. You might be able to renegotiate the terms or even declare bankruptcy, but that's usually very difficult to do, and you just need to pay off the agreed amount.<br><br>The amount of backlog debt is not fixed in the same way:<br>- Some backlogs can (and should?) simply be discarded -- throw away the list and start over -- delete the old emails and start over - put low priority projects on hold, or stop them altogether. We usually don't have that freedom with monetary debts. <br><br>- I've never seen a mortgage-sized debt turn into a credit-card-sized debt simply by waiting for the mortgage to "stand out". But that happens all the time with Mark's "standing out" process. When you are fighting resistance, tasks take much longer to accomplish. They feel gigantic. But it's often an illusion. How many of us have been resisting a task for weeks or even years, and when we finally decide to do the task, it's done in 20 minutes. Lots of us had that experience with AF1. <br><br>- When you are in a flow state, tasks can be accomplished much more quickly. Once I get on a roll clearing some backlog, it gets faster and faster, the decisions flow very quickly, and it can all be accomplished much more quickly than expected. <br><br>- The way one orders one's work can have a dramatic impact on how fast it gets done. Example, clearing an email backlog usually goes much faster when I process most-recent to oldest. As I reach the older items, I find many of them are already completed or no longer relevant, and they are faster to clear out. So the process accelerates as I work through it, and that growing momentum helps to get it done more quickly. Processing oldest to most-recent has the opposite effect.<br><br>In short: task size isn't nearly as fixed as we imagine. This is the biggest difference between task debt / time debt / backlogs on one hand, and monetary debt on the other hand.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2018 at 17:56 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>These differences between task debt and monetary debt also imply that time budgeting and monetary budgeting need to be handled differently. Budgets seem to work better if they are more specific. Like Dave Ramsey says, "Every dollar has a name". <br><br>That doesn't work so well for me, when managing tasks and backlogs. If I have a lot of deeper project work that needs to be done, I get a lot better results if I block out some 2-4 hour blocks of time over the coming week, and use No-List or FVP or some system like that to manage the time. When I know I have a couple hours of uninterrupted time, this makes it easier to find the right focus and get some deeper work done, and the No-List / FVP process helps me find the right things to do.<br><br>This works much better for me than blocking out 2 hours for Project A, 3 hours for Project B, etc. For me, blocking out time for specific projects almost always guarantees that I will work on *anything but* the designated project.<br><br>Not everyone agrees with me on this. There are apps like SkedPal that are specifically designed to budget all your time. https://www.skedpal.com/  Francis Wade has written a lot of good material about this. <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://perfect.mytimedesign.com/blog/">http://perfect.mytimedesign.com/blog/</a>  I just don't find the methods work for me as well as Mark's methods do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2018 at 18:04 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
