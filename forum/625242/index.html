It sounds great, but it isn't working like that for me. <br><br>Here's what I'm struggling with.<br><br>-The lists seem messy and unappealing to me. I guess I'm used to my tidy online lists. This just feels messy and it makes me want to avoid my list.  <br><br>-Still struggling with recurring tasks, though differently than I expected. I do Recurring Task A, cross it off, and write it on the end; no problem (except for the times I forget to rewrite it...). I keep stumbling, though, when I'm working on the last page, where I rewrote these; it's not something I need to do again until tomorrow, so I seem to be spending a lot of time mentally filtering the list for things I can actually work on right now. It's particularly troublesome for me when it's a "fun" task; naturally that's the one I want to work on, even though it's not appropriate to do it again until tomorrow. (Example: I diligently read one short story a day. It's fun and useful. But I can't afford to dedicate too much time to it, or nothing else would get done. One a day is both a way to be diligent, and a way to limit it.) So it feels like the system is both making me do a lot of filtering before I can apply the useful intuitive parts, and taunting me with things I'd like to do but shouldn't. <br><br>--And it's still easier to just screw around on the internet than work the list. I'm most envious of the people who have reported that they can't stay away from the list, that all their procrastination has disappeared, etc. No doubt this  has way more to do with me than with any system--but somehow this system seems to fix other people, but not me. <br><br>Suggestions?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 0:10 | Beth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Beth:<br><br>What do you find messy and unappealing about the list? Mine looks very neat - I make sure that items are crossed out in a very uniform way, which make it easy to see which tasks are left to be done. The more crossings out there are the more I get a motivating sense of progress.<br><br>Don't try to mentally filter the list. If you try to do this with your rational mind, you will feel stress and resistance. The secret is to let your unconscious intuition take over. That's why I talk in the instructions about waiting for items to "stand out". <br><br>And try not to come to the list with too many proconceptions about what is "appropriate". For instance it might not actually be the end of the world if you read more than one short story a day. Trust the system to make that decision for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 0:30 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Beth<br><br>The secret really is using the intuitive aspect of AF and not trying to force rationality into our decisions.  It sounds a little airy-fairy but does work ......<br><br>As one who is getting loads of stuff done and feeling free that does not mean I do not have items on my list that I am currently resisting.  However that is OK - AF is enabling me to identify them and also to look at why I am resisting them.  The ability to do just a little on an item helps to get a task started which is often the biggest hurdle ..... <br><br>A thought occurred to me when reading your post - procrastination is putting off something we believe should be done by wasting time.  The tasks we write on our system are all items we believe we should do.  NB We genuinely should be doing some fun things (or we will end up as nervous wrecks) and also need to do certain chores or administrative items (or end up unable to pay our bills and starving to death).  If all those tasks should be done (and any that are genuinely unnecessary will be rejected by the system) then doing them is not procrastinating.<br><br>If we put off doing our tax return by defrosting the fridge, watching TV and web-surfing, at the end of the day we feel we have procrastinated, achieved nothing and feel a failure.  However those items do actually need to be done (including TV watching or other leisure activities) or our life will become unbalanced.  With the exception of items that need to be done to a deadline it often does not matter when or in which order we do those things.  AF provides a mechanism for all of those items to get done, but to be done *when we feel like it* i.e. intuitively.  Consequently there is not the same level of resistance, or guilt, as in other systems, and that is how I am getting things done.  By the end of a standard working day with AF I will be highly likely to have completed 7 or 8 hours worth of tasks as opposed to maybe 3 hours with 4 hours wasted.  In fact I have to stop myself from working on the lists.<br><br>PS I don't actually have "watch TV" on my list (although I will be adding leisure activities at some point)!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 1:36 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>I find your comments a joy to read. Please keep them coming.<br><br>I am also astounded by how different some of my reactions to AF have been compared to yours. I still might be doing AF wrong, so I think it's important to explain where we differ. <br><br>I don't feel at all "free" when I am doing AF. I feel that the system is compelling me to do things that I don't want to do in order to allow me to reach the page that has the thing that I do want to do. I know that others are not describing their experience that way (instead they are describing it the way you do), but that definitely is how I feel about it. If, right now, I feel like organizing my file folders, I am not free to do so. I must write this at the end of my list. Then I MUST work at least one item on each page that stands between my current page and the last page on my list. <br><br>There is an almost palpable feeling of compulsion, which I would never describe as freedom. <br><br>Where I agree strongly with you is in your claim that it is a brilliantly effective tool to counter procrastination. Although I have not had much opportunity to procrastinate this week, the system is very accurately named Autofocus, since its very structure forces me to stay focused on what is important.<br><br>I think it is essential to put procrastinating items on my list. As I've written in another thread, they serve as powerful drivers of the system. If I want to check out markforster.net to see what Christine has written lately, I will add it to the end of my list. But I am not free to go now to the website. I have to earn the right to visit the website. And I earn that right by paying my dues and slogging through any number of pages of things that I don't particularly feel like doing, but I know are worth doing. <br><br>By the time I get to the website, I don't feel guilty reading it. And, as Mark wrote elsewhere in this forum, I am much less likely to spend too long on the website. I won't feel guilty because I had to work pretty hard to reach this fun item. And I probably won't spend too long on the website because I am keenly aware of the huge overhang of undone things remaining to be done. <br><br>With standard DIT, I could procrastinate longer, because I could fool myself into thinking there was nothing left, after all, I completed my list for today.<br><br>With GTD, I did have a huge list of undone things. But I only had to go through the whole list once a week. And I never had to do anything on the list after reading it.<br><br>So, I agree, AF is a great procrastination-buster. But, to be honest, I don't find it very intuitive or free. I actually feel something like a rat in a maze. There's cheese at the other end of the maze and those clever scientists have kept my at 80% of my free-feeding weight, so I am very hungry.<br><br>The rat is moises. The corridors of the maze are the pages of my list. The cheese is the item that I want to do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 2:49 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>I echo Moises, your comments are so valuable.<br><br>So far, my only problem is that I find difficult to stop doing things. This does not mean that I am euphoric and doing an excess, however I keep working when I should stop. I am also curious  about people reaction to AF and read this forum a few times a day when I would prefer to read just once.<br><br>The question I have is about doing a task that is not urgent, and it is not in AF list. So instead of going to tasks that belong to my list, I decide, for instance, to iron a skirt. How should I deal with this?<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 4:01 | Silvia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>moises<br>There's probably cheese on each page but the rat hasn't found it. By just taking a little nibble of one task on each page, you might discover a tasty chunk!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 10:14 | Linda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Moises:<br><br>Just as a matter of interest, how many lines do you have on a page?<br><br>My impression is that the more lines you have on a page (within reason) the easier the system is to work. I'm using 34 lines to the page which I found significantly easier than my original page which had about ten lines less.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 11:19 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks so much moises &amp; Silvia for your kind comments.  To be honest this is the first time that I have contributed in a discussion forum and was worried that I was posting too much!<br><br>moises, it sounds from your post as if there is still a degree of overlaying rational thinking onto your lists.  I can totally relate to the feeling that there are items I should be doing "before" I allow myself to do the "nicer" tasks.  That approach will certainly progress a task list but will be turning it into more of a "will do" list as in DIT (which still works far far beter than most other systems) and may ultimately lead to frustration and abandoning the system.   If you look at the way you are relating to the "stand out" concept, I suspect that you are looking at items that stand out for you because you rationally believe them to be urgent and important.  For me the key has been to do the items that stand out intuitively, i.e. those I *feel* like doing.  Believe me they are very different items!  I really believe this is what Mark means by trusting the system.<br><br>My experience so far is that the lists are gradually sorting themselves out and I think you will find that as you move on the pages will feel more balanced in containing items you want to do rather than feel you ought to do.  Let the system guide you - if you feel like doing something then by all means look to moving to that item as quickly as possible.  If it means spending just a few minutes on one item per previous page then that is OK.  You will get back to those pages and any resultant relisted items in due course.  By doing items you feel you "ought" to do you may actually doing them out of order - trust that the system will bring you to the point when you either (a) want to do them, (b) rephrase them (c) dismiss them as unnecessary or (d) re-evaluate why that item is there and whether your resistance is due to other factors.<br><br>NB That does not do away with the fact that there things that *must* be done but they can generally be covered by the scheduling and/or common sense approaches.<br><br>Remember that just because you feel like a rat in a maze does not mean you need to be controlled by the scientists with the cheese (external factors).  Imagine AF as your secret tunnel to the local cheese shop which they don't know about and which you can access at any time :-)<br><br>Silvia, as for items that are urgent and not on the list I think these will gradually become clear as you work the system.  There will always be routines linked to other activities.  For example I now keep a shopping list in my "electronic AF system" so a task when I go shopping will be to "print shopping list".  Whether that remains a recurring item or slips off the list as i automatically do it anyway will remain to be seen.  As AF is new I am adding a lot of routines in order to allow the system to work to it's full potential.  If you had added "iron skirt" to your list you would have had an item to cross out, or you would have just done it automatically without entering it on the list under the "common sense" approach. However, if you had added it to the list and not done it - or felt a high resistance to doing it - then that may have led you on to other questions, e.g. "am I being efficient about when/how I do my ironing?" (perhaps I am ironing on an as needed basis where a batch basis would be better), "do I resent this skirt because it always needs ironing?", or" does this skirt really need ironing or am I being too fussy?"<br><br>For me the freeing aspect of AF is the fact that my mind is somehow clearer and enabling me to question a lot more.  moises, do try the "when i feel like it" approach and see if that "feels" beter :-)<br><br>Sorry folks, another long post :-o<br><br>Oh yes, and re this forum, I have some days with very little discretionary time but just an odd ten minutes or half an hour.  My "decision" was to use that time to check the forum (I would otherwise have just wasted the time) and I find the forum itself keeps me autofocused in the ideas etc. that are coming up.  First thing in the morning and late eveining are also good times when I generally not reviewing my lists anyway - &amp; don't feel guilty about it! :-)  (I've already posted about the trick I use to keep my place so it doesn't always take me as long as it did at first!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 11:26 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark wrote: "My impression is that the more lines you have on a page (within reason) the easier the system is to work.

You've written this a number of times, but I wasn't sure how important this was. I am glad that you directed this suggestion specifically in response to the issues I raised. Today is Saturday and I will not use AF till Monday morning. I will try to find a more suitable notebook. I had been using what is called a Stenography Notebook here in the US. It allowed 25 items/page. I will go hunting for a different notebook today.<br><br>P.S. to others reading this post. Mark has written elsewhere that when changing notebooks it is of key importance to maintain the page structure when rewriting items from the old book to the new book. So we are to draw a line in the new book where each page in the old book ended. <br><br>Thanks again,<br><br>moises</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 13:36 | moises</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
