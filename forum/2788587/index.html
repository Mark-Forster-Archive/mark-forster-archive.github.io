However, most of the tools end up in a drawer. I've learned my lesson. The most important thing for me is to gather my sketches (all done on iPad), important photos (all done w/ iPhone) and daily narrative and capture for nostalgic (and keepsake) purposes. And for all of that to happen - effortlessly - I need to forgo the luxuriant feel of pen to paper.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2022 at 14:12 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like this!<br><br>What's the advantage of using the Apple Pencil and later uploading it vs using paper, taking a photo, and using OCR to render it to text.

It has a stylus and allows you to take notes. The screen is lightly textured so it feels closer to writing on paper than using a tablet. It has genuinely replaced paper notes for me entirely.<br><br>I originally bought it to take notes in 1-2-1 meetings with staff. Using a laptop felt as though it created a barrier and could give the impression that I was checking email rather than being present. Paper notes felt a bit scruffy and meant maintaining separate notebooks for each staff member.<br><br>I've held off mentioning it previously because I didn't want to sound like an advert for it. It's maddeningly expensive - I bought mine factory reconditioned on black Friday and still struggled to justify the cost. The battery could also be better, but that's likely due to the age of my device. And whilst you can read ebooks on it, you can't import them from the Kindle (Amazon have a proprietary file format), and there's no back light.<br><br>I agree that taking photos of notebooks and using OneNote is a workable substitute, but I can't switch back! Being able to erase and undo handwriting, shift text around, and keep all my notebooks together seem like minor things, but I lean on them quite a bit.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2022 at 14:19 | JohnD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>JohnD:<br><br>I'm on the Remarkable advertising email list, so I keep up pretty well with what it's got to offer, but In spite of its looking like it deserves the "remarkable" name, I've never quite felt that the cost justifies the difference from what I can do already with my current set-up (Desktop and Smartphone).
