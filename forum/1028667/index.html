It didn't take too many times of giving dumb reasons like my friend gave it to me as a gift, I might want to lend it to someone, or I might reread it to figure out that they needed to go. I have only regretted giving one of those books away and these days most books are easily replaced if need be. I also had to let go of the notion of being my friends' personal library. The cool thing about buying digital books (which I try to do when I can't find it on paperbackswap) is there's no guilt about keeping them all!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2010 at 4:09 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman U: one of the most beautiful looking blogs out there, that I like to visit when I think I need to do and have more.
