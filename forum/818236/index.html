Count me in.<br><br>My challenge to myself is this:  To stay "on list" for at least 100hours in July.<br><br>Where does this come from?  Well, I have found after 6 months of self-observation using AF that as long as I can say on list all goes very well.  However, I can easily slip "off list" and once I do it is difficult to get back.  Furthermore, like a few others on the forum, I have just spent almost 2 weeks on "AF6".  Just a cold, mind you, but even a cold renders me nearly useless.<br><br>So it is time for a revival.  AF2 is bound to offer me an exciting fresh start.  A return to better health will certainly help too.  And now your suggestion, Jacqueline, of a July Challenge is truly energizing.  My way of reporting back would be to post my total number of hours spent "on list" every 10 days.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2009 at 5:28 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am so very in for this, great idea Jacqueline!

Over the last few days I have stayed "on list" from the moment I've got up in the morning to the moment I go to bed at night. It has worked just fine.<br><br>One of the secrets of avoiding distractions is to put the distraction itself on the list. So when I a sudden urge to research photos of the Sarychev Peak Volcano eruption, instead of leaping to Google I put "Sarychev Peak Volcano photos" on my list and the interruption is tamed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2009 at 9:09 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark<br><br>I am struck by the difference between my resolve to spend at least an average of 3 hours per day "on list" and your claim that it works fine to spend 24 hours per day "on list".  (All you would need to add is "take 8 hours sleep" to reach a total of 24 hours.)<br><br>From what you have already shared about AF2 it sounds like it may might be easier to stay incessantly "on list" than it would have been with AF1.<br><br>Accordingly, here is a challenge someone might like to take up: To stay "on list" for a total of 744 hours in July 2009  (24 hours multiplied by 31 days - for the mathematically challenged.)<br><br>Whether this sounds possible might well be revealed at 9pm tonight Melbourne time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2009 at 11:01 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jim, that sounds like an "Impossibility" goal - even if you didn't achieve it, think how far you'd come even in *failing*!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 June 2009 at 11:15 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark<br>You stated:<br>"Over the last few days I have stayed "on list" from the moment I've got up in the morning to the moment I go to bed at night.

On any given day, there's a a gazillion unproductive websites that I like to visit - mostly military, hockey and markforester.net (your site is not productive if I'm using it to avoid doing work). If I keep adding websites to the bottom of my list, these items will always "jump out at me".

There's a world of difference between deciding on impulse to go to an unproductive website (for example), and writing down a task to visit that website. Writing it down brings different parts of the brain into use.<br><br>Also, if you record the dates that you do items, you can see exactly what you are doing with your time, which is in itself a big incentive to do better!<br><br>(Each morning after I've ruled the "dismissal" line, I put the day of the month (e.g. 27) in the left hand margin next to every task that was done the day before)<br><br>Anyway I'm merely telling you how I manage to stay on the list all day, not suggesting that you necessarily have to do the same.

So if I'm in the middle of something and I think "I need to remember to ask the neighbours to look after the cat this weekend", I can just write "Ask Jim &amp; Sue re Furzyworzylovekins" down on the list and it will get done next (or when appropriate). &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, it works well that way ... but that NAME ;-) ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a hypothetical example. We don't have a cat &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Imagine my surprise ;-) ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (and if we did it would be called "Cat") &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>No, what you don't know about cats is that they come with names and you tempt fate if you dare to change it ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 June 2009 at 14:13 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Learning,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Furzyworzylovekins......ROTFL ROTFL ROTFL ROTFL That's almost as funny as Mike calling his male cat.................BUBBLES!!!!!!!  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Update on Bubbles ... he is getting better every day.  Now, after breakfast, he comes up next to me on the couch, looks at me with his big cow eyes, and waits for me to let him sniff the comb.  Then he rubs his whiskers against the comb which is cat for "PLEEEEASE comb me!"  Then he lies down for a good long combing before he falls asleep.  LOL ;-)  He has finally discovered that running away and hiding is not his best strategy.  But then, cats are nothing if not flexible ;-)<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 June 2009 at 14:18 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; No, what you don't know about cats is that they come with names and you tempt fate if you dare to change it ;-)  &gt;&gt;<br><br>Which is one of the reasons we don't have a catty-watty.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 June 2009 at 14:58 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>July challenge?  I'm in!<br><br>My major goal is to finish working through the business planning book I am using with my new business idea: result will be clarified ideas about the business, a draft business plan and a list of steps from here to there (here being the 9-to-5, there being my own business).<br><br>I am committing now to a progress report on here each week, I'll aim for Sundays. <br><br>I will also use AF2 at home and work every day except for the week that I am away.  I had become very half-assed in my use of AF and feel much more positive about AF2.  The structure sounds like it will address the issues I was having with AF; I'll let you know.<br><br>Good luck everyone, <br>Lucy</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 June 2009 at 17:49 | Lucy</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
