Feel free to use it :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 January 2010 at 22:32 | Mathias</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>With the different AF versions, it seemed like someone would post a "tweak" of some kind, or maybe identify a limitation in the current version.  That would spark something in Mark's mind, and he'd go off and sequester himself for a couple weeks.  He'd then emerge with a new system that elegantly solved whatever limitations were there before, and sometimes you could see the grains of the ideas that other people had proposed, but Mark had taken those grains, and put them into use in such a clean, elegant, intuitive way, that it looked like a whole new approach.  Which indeed it was.  There are so many "tidbits" of time management wisdom that we all carry around with us.  Mark is THE expert at integrating those tidbits into a working coherent system.  Plus he always came up with a few new tidbits that no one else had thought of...  <br><br>So, here is my guess...  I think ping-pong had something to do with it.  Maybe the new system is something like this:<br><br>1.  You use a daily diary book.<br><br>2.  New tasks are added to tomorrow's diary page.<br><br>3. You start the day by looking at today's page.  You process it in "AF1" fashion -- read through the list once, and then go back to the top and carefully go down through each item.  Do whatever stands out.  Work on it as long as you want.  Keep cycling through the page till nothing stands out.<br><br>4. Then go back to the earliest diary page that still has open tasks on it.  Process them in "AF1" fashion.  When nothing stands out, you can either move forward to the next diary page with tasks still on it, or jump forward to "today".  <br><br>5. For all old pages, "dismissal rules" are in effect.  When you come to the page, if nothing stands out, it all gets "dismissed".  Not sure how that would be handled.  Maybe whenever you do a dismissal like that, you should add a new task on tomorrow's page to "review dismissed items".<br><br>6.  During the day, as new tasks arise, they normally would go on tomorrow's task list.  If it genuinely is something that CAN'T be started till some time in the future, then write it on the diary page for the earliest day when you can start on it.  If it is something that MUST be done TODAY, then draw a line at the bottom of today's task list, and start adding the new urgent items below that line.<br><br><br>So, Mark, is my guess anything close to what you've got in the works?  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 January 2010 at 23:25 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>OK, I couldn't resist looking...you know how all that talk about stationary items gets me as excited as the prospect of having a system that combines my beloved DIT principals with AF4 in some way.

It was something like Do It (mostly) this Week.

I'm interested to see if you go back to a paged based system (a la AF1) and if you carry forward the AF1 type of dismissal rules.  With dated pages it seems as if that is where this is going, though I suppose you could circulate through previous days pages for an AF4 effect.  The possibilities are endless ;-)<br><br>I had recently tweaked my AF4 composition book based system (I never did get back to my pocket format and I've got mixed feelings about that, damn it ;-) to include a "diary" component to it.  Nothing earth shaking ... I just drew a vertical line and use the right side of each page for dated notes.  I did not think to use a separate page for each day because I don't normally add 25 new tasks each day.  I suppose if I did move to a page-a-day system I could revert back to my pocket book as I'd have more room.  Hmmm... remains to be seen.<br><br>Anyway, I'm waiting with baited breath to see what this new system is like.  If past is prologue, this should be fascinating.<br><br>Oh, and +1 for an Andreas type demo, if that makes any sense at all.

Yeah, I kind of understand your system and I do "some" of the things you do, as I've mentioned.  I guess I don't see the point of learning DIT just so I can understand the historical roots of it when a hybrid DIT/AF system comes out.

It might be that "son of DIT" will work for me, but who knows.  I think these different systems work best for people who have different working environments that mesh well with them.  I can't count how many times people cant manage AF4 and need to go back to AF1, etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 14:47 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>The main reason for buying the book in this context is that my initial explanation of how DIT2 works will probably assume knowledge of DIT.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 16:01 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"I can't count how many times people cant manage AF4 and need to go back to AF1, etc. "<br><br>The delusion that an updated DIT or AFwill help me with my taxes is the reason I keep coming back to these boards. <br><br>The best advice - mentioned by Tim Ferris, Barbara Sher, Marcus Buckingham - is to focus on what you love doing, and outsource (as best you can) the other stuff. And yet, I'm 2 years behind on my taxes.

It tells you to write "Plan to do Taxes" on your list.  When AF tells you it's time to plan, follow Barbara's other piece of advice: Pull out a sheet of paper and map out the things that are necessary to complete your taxes.  <br><br>Perhaps the first thing in your plan is to gather papers related to your taxes.  Add to your plan (A) filling in forms, or (B) hiring someone to fill in forms.  Add a few more details to your plan.<br><br>So following AF you planned your work.  Rephrase your task to "Work on Taxes".  Then following AF and your above plan you actually do the work.  If it's onerous, follow Mark's advice to just do a little bit.<br><br>The only way this can fail is if when the system says do a little bit, and you know it needs doing, and you know it's only a small thing, then you decide not to do anything.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 16:26 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike,<br><br>There's a lot more in the book than the basic DIT method.

You are free to choose action or inaction.  If you instead chose to do one thing, how would that turn out?  If you choose to do nothing, how will that turn out.  Be aware of the benefits, the agony, the things you mightt do instead, the effect on self-image, positives and negatives.  Now you're fully aware of the consequences of action and of inaction.  Keep those in mind, and if you think inaction is the better package, go for it and be satisfied.<br><br>You are free.

My tax situation is complex and I dread it.  The only way it works for me is to get under the gun then work full out until it is done.  It usually takes a full two days, including digging up paperwork.  The tax it self is not the problem... you just get a copy of TurboTax and plug in the information.  The problem can be in distilling the information.  Not a big thing for W-2s or 1099s, but if you own property and have rents, expenses, etc. that can take a while to compile.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 22:43 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike<br>This is precisely why I have my scut cap and use my timer. It forces me to both do the dreaded scut ......and.........wisely choose what scut I'm going to focus on!  LOL!  I've got my scut down to 90minutes daily cap and 6 hours weekly cap.  Getting over the hump with a carefully distilled scut list makes the rest of my work infinitely more pleasurable to do because the scut cap keeps the dread sensations at bay!  LOL!  Before I created my scut cap methodology, I was mired in too much "optional" scut.  Who needs that?<br><br>Hi Avrum<br>I could never stay current or slightly ahead without my timer!  The default setting is 15minutes but I can set it to 2minutes, 5minutes, etc in hopes of launching myself into a high anxiety/high resistance task.  If it works, great.  If not, do it again and again until you've completed the total amount of scut you need to accomplish to feel OK to enjoy your other work.  I also use this to complete tasks while in pain.  I set the timer according to my resistance level and I set the total amount according to staying current enough to avoid dread and nagging sensations.  Those interfere horribly against creative flow!<br><br>  Heck, Avrum......When it's something particularly onerous and particularly important (such as taxes ;&gt;0....) I'll set up another work station just for it and do it piecemeal between the other work.  The low timer settings are your safety cap.....but....secretly, I'm hoping that the launch takes hold and I wind up doing a decent chunk of it!  At the least, dodging the taxes will prey on your creative resources and your overall approach to doing your work.<br>Doing a few short stints of it between your other stuff will at least keep the thing moving a bit forward rather than turn into a horrible, mood and energy guzzling NAG MONSTER!  LOL!<br>p.s.....You aren't afraid of the IRS biting at your butt?  Let us know how you do.  We're rooting for your success however you decided to achieve it!  Good Luck!  p.s.  If I didn't have my scut cap, I'd be in a horrible mess!
