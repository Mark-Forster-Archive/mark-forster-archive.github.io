In DIT there is the useful, clear guidance on auditing backlogs in order to resolve the cause. <br><br>My questions is: How do we manage (using AF) to take on only a realistic amount of tasks that will get done properly and in a timely manner? I.e. How do we know when enough is enough and we cannot agree or give ourselves more work to do than we can do properly?<br><br>The reason I'm asking is because there are elements in AF that I like, but the above issue is very important to me as I live in a work culture (as do most of us) of an expectation to take on more (tasks) with less (time). <br><br>Mark, I would especially value your comments as I would say this is the main sticking point re AF for me at the moment. <br><br>Thanks</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2009 at 12:34 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon:<br><br>I notice you say "may be all too easy" instead of "is too easy", so I'm wondering whether this just a theoretical question you have about AF, or does it arise out of actual experience? <br><br>If it's a theoretical question, then my answer would be not to anticipate problems until you have them - AF is pretty good at sorting out priorities. If it's a question from an actual problem you have experienced, then can you tell us more about what form the problem has taken?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2009 at 13:16 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>IMHO this isn't a problem of Autofocus but a problem with lack of assertiveness. <br><br>There are many ways to say No without being uncourteous or unfriendly.<br><br>One of my favorites is 'Saying No without Saying No', watch and listen:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bnet.com/2422-13731_23-265800.html">http://www.bnet.com/2422-13731_23-265800.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2009 at 13:31 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark, thanks for your quick response to my query (a testament to AF!). It's a good question. <br><br>Firstly, when working AF I was feeling overwhelmed quickly as I was opening up several (no more than this)  new projects at home and felt like I had loads to do, where as with DIT I knew when I'd done a days work as I'd cleared my list. I know that with AF it's best to set start and finish times but somehow the tasks on the list would still be on my mind.  <br><br>Secondly, when working AF at work I found it hard to justify why I could not take on at the moment and it felt difficult to tell when I was starting to get behind. However with DIT it seems easier to explain that I have X number of tasks to complete over the next few days so I cannot take the task on at the moment. Also, with DIT - the Audit feature seems to help me keep my clinical caseload manageable and realistic. <br><br>I would really like to resolve my difficulties with AF...do you have any tips?<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2009 at 13:37 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Rainer, good advice!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2009 at 13:38 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon:<br><br>The idea of AF is that it sifts what you put in it and concentrates on what is important or right for you at the time. So you should be able to open up any number of projects and some will die and some will stand still and some will progress. <br><br>What you must be careful of is committing yourself to something in such a way that you can't get out of it. This is normally when the commitment is made to other people. In this case I would advise using Rainer's suggestion. Or simply saying that your time is fully committed at the moment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2009 at 15:11 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>OK Mark, thanks for your advice, which is highly appreciated. I probably need to commit to AF for several weeks to change from a DIT mindset / approach. I guess it's actually fine for some projects to wither and die whilst other flourish. One advantage I have found with AF is the ease, a lack of drag, of moving selected projects forward so here goes...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2009 at 15:28 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It might help to track how your AF list is expanding (or contracting!) over time. I put today's date next to each item as I cross it off. Then at the end of the day I draw a line under the last item, and write down three numbers:<br><br>First, the number of items I added today, found by counting the items between this line and the previous one.<br>Second, the number of items I completed today, found by scanning all the pages.<br>Third, the number of active items, found by (previous active count + items added - items completed)<br><br>Now I can easily flip back through my list and see how its size has changed over time - and if it ever grew a lot for several days in a row, I'd know that I was taking on more than I was doing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 March 2009 at 3:44 | Jonathan H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jonathan<br><br>An expanding list doesn't have to correlate to added commitments. As I am in the early days of AF I am still adding commitments that I had previously made as they occur to me. Another is added granularity. What started as "Organize Seminar" can expand to "Phone Pete re venue" and "Phone Trish re attendees" as it gets worked on.<br><br>John</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 March 2009 at 7:03 | Johnners</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Also since AF is not a "get everything done" system but one that's intended to sift tasks automatically, there may be a lot of "possibles" on the list - which are there to see if the system makes anything of them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 March 2009 at 17:33 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think the important thing to remember is that just because it is on the list does not mean that it "must" be done - but could be a "possible" as Mark calls it.  The other thing to remember is that the list can capture "everything".  Therefore it provides a real sense of security, in that, once you get used to entering everything on your list, you always know where to find things.<br><br>Johnners point about expanding lists is an important one - some days my items will increase drastically, usually if I have a really creative day when a lot of thoughts spring to mind - or I am working on a project which generates a lot of new items.  Although I maintain a seperate project list, my early thoughts will go into AF, may then migrate to my project list to be sorted, and ultimately come back to my AF list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 March 2009 at 22:41 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
