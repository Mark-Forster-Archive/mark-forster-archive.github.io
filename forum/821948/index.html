Glad to see that others who are like me, who don't have urgent tasks are going back as well.  I REALLY like AF condensed and feel it is more conducive to getting the important things done - and allows me to push my limits on a daily basis.  And I REALLY like AF1 on weekends when I have all day free to work on it and close off old active pages.  <br><br>I have a bunch of projects at work due to being away for 2 weeks, so am happy again there because I have "too much" to do - and I love being in that situation.  Not being busy has made me dislike the job itself and made me procrastinate on what I do have to do.  Not using AF at work, but am using my usual methods of *focus* - one project at a time - and compulsion for closure.  Just can't mess with what works well already.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 2:53 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Accidentally deleted yesterday's update:<br>Lose 15 lbs - down 2 pounds for total of 2.8, down another .4 this a.m. total of 3.2 (&gt;20% done!)<br>Declutter garage - took in recycling and goodwill items that I'd put in from yesterday's decluttering session<br>Earn $10k - Earned 0.

Found a picture online of exactly what I want to do with the reno and it wouldn't be difficult to do myself.  Found a tiling class geared towards the home renovator at the local technical institute that I can take this fall.  I'd really like to learn to do this myself since I want to renovate houses in the future as well and want to tile the kitchen backsplash and another bathroom in this house, so it may be what I'll do since I'll probably save myself $6k by taking the course.

Now I just need mini taps, it appears!<br><br>Zane, I really do think that fast-5 is very similar to the No S diet.  For me it's the restricting of the snacking.  I know some people do fast-5 as a "window" and eat for 5 hours.  I don't, I eat one meal around 2 p.m. and one around 6-7 p.m.  That's it.  I honestly don't get hungry until maybe 11 a.m., then it goes away and doesn't come back until mid afternoon.  The key for me is that the 2 p.m. meal has to a) have &gt; 25g of protein &amp; b) be ~ 750 calories.  That ensures that it'll tide me over so that I am not actually hungry when I eat the second and last meal of the day.   (And not hungry when I do a run through the grocery store either!)<br><br>Fortunately, I don't have sugar cravings and don't eat huge portions.  My poison is high salt foods and (used to be) wobbly pops.  I quit that though since AF gives me another hobby.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 July 2009 at 18:38 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline,<br><br>If/when Fast-5 doesn't do it for you, try the No S diet.

Happy not to have met the goal and change the focus to process rather than outcome.  August goal will be to follow fast-5 w/90% compliance.<br>Declutter garage - about 75% completed, just have to take the time to go through some boxes - son is moving out in a couple of weeks so a lot will go to him.  August goal will be to finish this.  Every box is listed separately on the list, so it will get done.<br>Earn $10k - very surprised that I made just over $7.5k (last minute legal/sale crises/deadlines pushed this up alot over the last few days). Will be working every day this long weekend (work babysitter coming in for the weekend to keep my butt in chair) so I will easily make over $10k in August.  Have to constantly remind myself to "make hay when the sun shines." As much as I'd rather be out camping, it's a financially stupid thing to do right now.<br>Novel - this hasn't worked out very well although the outline is partially done and the prologue is written.  I have ordered a book that breaks down the steps to plotting and writing that stresses small daily actions which I hope will help.  August goal will be to finish the outline.  All on the list, but in a clump, so may have to break it up using the little lines at the bottom of the page to use RAF properly.<br>Exercise - still doing slow, intense weight training in the mornings. I do have a gym membership (that I've hardly used) and plan to hit the gym on weekends for 20 minute leg workout (I don't have a squat rack at home).  My son has been walking the dog every day, so I haven't been doing that enough, but I get a lot of fast walking and stairs in around campus at work.  August goal will be to keep training weekday mornings and hit the gym for legs every weekend.<br>Bathroom reno - Floor is 75% removed (glued down mdf), ceiling painted, toilet ready to be taken off, walls prepped, beadboard ordered, light fixture bought, moulding and casing and door style decided upon for whole house, tile off around tub (removal left holes in drywall).  August goal will be to finish this project.  It's all on the list.<br>15 minutes cleaning - doing well with reverse AF but should increase this to 20 minutes in August and get my kids to join me more often.<br><br>Overall, in every case I didn't meet the goal, I'm happy I didn't do what it would have taken to meet it (sacrifice of balance).  <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 July 2009 at 13:23 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline - that's an amazing list of accomplishments for one month!  Congratulations.<br><br>Could you explain how you do the 15 minute cleaning thing? The times I have been most consistent and happy with my housework situation have come from spending 15 minutes a day, generally starting with the dishes and just doing whatever else seemed good at the time for at least 15 minutes. Never perfect, but my best by far. Do you think this fits with AF?<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 July 2009 at 13:49 | Jessica</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jessica, thanks!  <br><br>Re. the cleaning, sometimes it stood out with AF1 pretty naturally on its own.  If I was seeing that I wouldn't even touch cleaning using AF1 that day, I was switching to AF2 and writing what needed to be done and the time I would take (used my microwave timer).  So I was (at the time) sort of doing RAF in the reverse way, doing AF1 and switching to AF2 at the end of the day.  If you give yourself 3 minutes to clean the living room, you can move super fast and get it 50% done - which is good enough for me!  At some point, I'd like to be able to do that, and get it 95% done, I never want to be 100% (unless I'm selling a house).   <br><br>So, I would take the major rooms and write at the end of the list:<br><br>- kitchen - 3 min.<br>- bedroom - 3 min.<br>- bathroom - 3 min.<br>- LR/DR - 3 min.<br>- library - 3 min.<br><br>and do whatever "stood out" (sometimes literally!) in that room.  I'd rotate a bit and put in hallways, kids room, basement, laundry room, etc. occasionally.  (I have a very large house though.)  I didn't count the garage, laundry (daily every a.m.) or dishes in the cleaning time.  The laundry and dishes are part of my *new*! morning routine.<br><br>I think one of the things that's really helping is that I'm about 25% decluttered and am getting more ruthless with purging as I go along.  I eventually want to get back to the minimalism of my 20's and downsize to a little house (I just bought this house to flip).  Stuff doesn't make me happy, people and experiences do. :-)<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 July 2009 at 14:38 | Jacqueline</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
