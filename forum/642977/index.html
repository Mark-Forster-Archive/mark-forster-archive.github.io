Basicly you mean that one page is "closed list". And final page is open list.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 12:40 | Gupta</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gupta:<br><br>Each page is a closed list, except for the last one, which is open. <br><br>When you are using the list as one long list in the way you are doing, you are comparing each item with all the other items on the list. That means that there is a natural tendency to go for the easier or simpler items.<br><br>But with AF you only comparing each item with the other items on the same page. Your range of choice is much narrower. So for instance  my first active page contains only two items "Sort CDs" and "Prepare Friday's seminar". This means I have the following choices: do both items; do one of the items and leave the other for the next visit to the page; or do neither of the items and dismiss both of them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 14:48 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find myself not liking the idea of highlighting items to dismiss them and crossing off something that is partially complete (had some work done on it).<br><br>In the past, I have tended to cross items off my list when I completely cancel the item, never to work on it again.  I place a checkmark next to items that are complete.  I feel that highlighting an item would be a way to indicate that this item needs to be done next.<br><br>I also feel unsure about where to place some items that I feel I might want to do someday - books I want to read sometime maybe next month and also items that depend on previous items being done.  Currently the only way I have found to resolve this is put the first item on the current page I have been adding items to, and then put the item that depends on that item being done on the next page by itself.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 17:39 | Kenny D.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Almost forgot: +1 vote on telling people to try it on paper &amp; get that working before switching to a software solution.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 17:40 | Kenny D.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Kenny,<br><br>If  you put your "someday" items on your list they will eventually be dismissed.  If you use a permanent book and keep the old pages, you'll have them there to review for later.<br><br>As to what highlighting means, it can mean anything you want it to mean.  But I get your point, it does seem to imply emphasis rather than the opposite ... dismissal.  I had no trouble switching over because I don't highlight until the page is "inactive" and so there is no confusion.  I would not be on the pages seeing the highlighted items unless I was looking for dismissed (i.e. someday) items and then I WANT them emphasized to stand out from the completed ones.  Just a thought.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 17:56 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Kenny<br><br>Agree with Mike re the highlighting - if you only highlight at the point specified in the instructions then only non-active pages will have highlighted items on.  If you highlight an item as "needing to be done next" you are effectively rationally grading the urgency of that item and not working with the item "that stands out".  Additional highlighting or notation can affect the effectiveness of AF in that it disrupts the scanning of items.<br><br>Give it a try exactly as written for a while and then see if you feel differently.<br><br>Actually, with regard to someday items I think there can be value in adding them into your list.  Not necessarily all of them, and not in one go, but if you add them in you may find that, rather than dismiss them you may take action on them and start to progress them.  And if not, it's no big deal.  They just stay on your lists as "dismissed" and will be reviewed under your periodic review of dismissed items, when they can be re-added if you wish.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 18:10 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>It seems like what you're saying above (about your two items left on your first page) is that you can do an initial scan on a page, do the slower scan, choose one item, and then go on to the next page without dismissing that last item. I think I've seen you say this in another post, do at least one item on a page before going on to the next. In your original emailed instructions though, I thought you said keep rescanning one page until nothing stands out, and then dismiss everything left on the page before gong on to the next one. I've actually been doing the first, since I saw the post about do one before going on, but I want to check in about this. When to go on without dismissing and when to dismiss and then go on seems to be at the heart of this system, and I want to give it a  try as intended. Feel free to point me to another post if there's one that is the latest iteration.<br><br>As for the mention of one list above, I actually am really liking having a work list and an everything else list. If there's a task that needs to be done during work hours (call bank about x) I put it on the work list, otherwise it's on the everything else list. This lets me compare only things I can be doing (a bit of the GTD context take on things). I also really don't like to be concerning myself with all I have to do at work when I'm at home, and vice versa. This was one of my peeves about GTD - one is supposed to process all things in order, and software is frequently set up that way. So I would end up processing tons of home stuff at work and work stuff at home. I love the clean break I have between the worlds - I have more peace of mind in each place about I'm focusing on.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Sam</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 18:37 | Sam G</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sam:<br><br>What the instructions say is:<br><br>7.

Or are you doing one item and moving on to the next page without dismissing the items left on each page?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 21:55 | Sam G</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>OK, I just re-read your instructions and I think I can answer my own question. If you've done something on a page, and when going through that page again nothing stands out, you don't have to dismiss, since you already did something on that page. It's only if on your first pass on a page nothing stands out, then you dismiss things. You're probably sick of answering questions like these. It's so interesting to me - I've read these instructions at least a dozen times in the ten days I've had them, and that's the first time that part has been clear to me; the first time I saw it that way and got it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 22:05 | Sam G</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
