But when it comes down to making a decision to let go, it suddenly becomes very difficult.<br><br>So where does this fear of letting go of these tasks come from?<br><br>We all seem to have it to some extent otherwise these systems wouldn't work. Any thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 14:05 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Perfectionist tendencies, the fear of losing control, of losing out if this is one task that will mean a lot in the end even if you don't know it now, fear of failure because dismissal means you can't handle a task load?<br><br>Just some random thoughts, because at one point or another, I experienced some of these feelings in one way or another when dimissing a task!<br><br>Today was an example of one such task. A biggie when I first penned it, I thought. But it lost it's value and vitality over a period of time, and I gave it a decent burial. Once the mourning was over, I had an immense feeling of release and power. Yes! I'm bigger than you are. But just in case you're important in the future, I'll add a task, "review dismissed tasks' at the end of the list :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 14:22 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Frank, I think we fear dismissing because we translate it as we will *never* do that.  eg. I will NEVER read Chapter 2 of 1984.  And that seems intolerable.  <br><br>I don't review dismissed tasks - I figure if they're important enough, they'll come up again.  And I've probably dismissed more than anyone on this forum.  I've come to enjoy it, it's part of the filtering - as it should be.  The way I phrase it though is to tell myself "not right now, you have other, more important things to do. Doing this will take precious time away from those important things."  <br><br>Those items that can easily be dismissed and are not are simply *clutter* - they're keeping us from doing what's more important.  It's a sign that someone doesn't know what their priorities - or limits - are.  Everything cannot be a priority, and we do not have infinite time.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 4:44 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I love to dismiss! Throw the whole lot out I say. I have way too many ideas and crazy plans. I am often overwhelmed. In other systems, even DIT I ened up with onenote or notebooks of ideas/tasks that for GTD would be SDMB, or even SDN (some day never). <br><br>When using AF I would count a dismissal as doing something on that page. That is very motivating! <br><br>I have an AF list going back to Dec 08. Which I know is pre AF. I started to add items from my task diary I was not doing to a master list. I would then spend some time each day trying to get some of it done. Because I know I have too many ideas/plans I was adding things in my task diary a month ahead, thinking I would review/do it then. But there was never time. So I ended up with a growing backlog pile that I kind of worked on as a mini project. And then I saw AF and there was a better way of doing the second lot of filters - ie dismissing things.<br><br>i have not gone back to my dismissed items. Like Jacqueline I think they will come up again. They usually do. But now I feel less like I am always looking after my lists. And I have got quite a bit done. Though I am thinking of going back to AF. I am just not finding the AF2 dismissal/starting from the end works for me. Plus I like writing my daily tasks in my task diary.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 6:57 | Amber</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Pondering the why, I am not sure is that helpful. Rather asking why I am not doing something, I find that the "how" is more illuminating. <br><br>Then again just getting better at dismissing without spending a lot mental of energy pondering  the why or how has been a good practice for me.<br><br>My reason is usually I think I want to do more than I do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 11:39 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Welcome back!  Hope you had a great time away!<br><br>I love your analogy with "clutter".  AF2 has enabled me to see that there was a fair amount of clutter within my lists that was not clearing quickly enough.  With AF2 that red line just marches inexorably on - like pacman munching everything in it's path.  Move or be gone!!!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 12:27 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
