For example, The Simplest Time Management Method makes the distinction clear. Above the line, we find tasks, below the line we find ideas. Simple Scanning and many of the other long list systems intersperse these two categories, and Mark has offered various practices to help us determine a) how to move an idea into the task category, and b) how to determine which ideas are not ready to become tasks.<br><br>I wonder what folks think about the importance of drawing this distinction. I'm currently using Simple Scanning, and feel like sometimes I would be better served by having separate lists for "I'm actively pursuing this and know it fits into my schedule" and "These would be nice to get around to once I have the resources."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 January 2018 at 22:15 | Voluntas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Perhaps you could create an ongoing project called "Start new projects" with its own separate list of actions, such as "Start Project X" and "Start Project Y." On your Simple Scanning list, you could enter this project name ("Start new projects"), and whenever it stood out, you could consult its own list in the usual way that we do for multi-step projects or multi-item ongoing tasks such as "Email." If you are feeling adventurous, you might even name this new creation "The Someday/Maybe Project."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2018 at 3:33 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie: <br>&lt;&lt;feel like sometimes I would be better served by having separate lists&gt;&gt;<br><br>I think if the number of tasks you have is very large (in the 100's), then separate lists would be easier to manage. That is certainly the case with me. I find it useful to do similar tasks in bulk for a few hours at a time. Separate lists of each general category helps gather them all together.<br>If the number of tasks are relatively small, then I imagine a catch all list would work fine.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2018 at 13:08 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie:<br><br>I understand the approach you've suggested. However, my concern with Simple Scanning after nearly a month of consistent use is that frequently scanning items which I'm not ready to do now diverts attention away from the items which are more relevant. I know that Mark would encourage me to add a "Weed list" entry, but I would prefer that the system itself do this job. After all, we don't write "Scan list" before we start work for the day. Even looking at the single "Start new projects" item could have a negative effect if there's simply no way for me to start a new project now.<br><br>SuperFocus was pretty good at tracking WIP, but too strict about which items got worked on, and when. The June 7 system seems like a good starting place for me, but I'm still thinking through some ideas about using the "done" items from today as a starting place for tomorrow's work. I'm also leaning toward using dismissal with June 7, rather than deletion.<br><br>Aside:<br>I may have done a poor job titling this thread, and writing my initial post. What I'm primarily concerned with lately is the effect of a long list on my _attention_, with the long term goal of achieving more focus on the items I'm actively involved in, and a better understanding of what priorities I've set for myself, either explicitly or implicitly.<br><br>--V</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2018 at 18:19 | Voluntas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>MrB:<br><br>I think you may have misunderstood my ideas. You've written about using separate lists to keep one project or area of concern separate from others. What I'm thinking about is separating items based on my level of involvement. I'm chasing after having a small list of items that I'm actually working on at the moment, and a longer list of things that I plan to do eventually, but don't need my attention right now.<br><br>--V</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2018 at 18:22 | Voluntas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Voluntas:<br><br>How about the recent(ish) real autofocus system, as that contains a deferral element that should keep the list more focussed?<br>What is the June 7 system as I can't seem to see that?

When one of these pages is filled, close off both pages and start the next two pages.<br><br>As with my current system (see Doting on My List), I would simple-scan the entire list, but circle about the last page (right side only).  The effect was what you talked about: the left pages are ideas, and the right pages are active tasks.<br><br>That said, I find the my current process more satisfying without this division.  It has the switch to alternate between simple scanning and working active tasks (and new tasks).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2018 at 2:31 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks all for responses! I've addressed y'all individually below, but I'd also like to say that your input has helped me sort out a (non-public) first draft of my new system. I'll report back in a few days to tell you about successes and failures.<br><br>MrB:<br><br>I tried RAF when Mark first published it. At the moment, I can't recall why I grew dissatisfied, but I thank you for reminding me of it. Also, nuntym provided the correct link to June 7. My new system will incorporate a daily cut-off and something similar to DDD.<br><br>nuntym:<br><br>I hestitate to try another catch-all list, because of the potential costs to my attention. Even though the FV variants only require that one scan below the last dotted item, the older items are still there, and a wandering eye might glance at one and become distracted. (BTW: when Mark first published the original FV, I spent some time working it and found I was most successful when I limited myself to two-item chains, which is somewhat similar to FFVP, i.e. "I have to eventually address the first list item, but first I'm going to find an item I want to do NOW")<br><br>Seraphim:<br><br>Your systems are clearly well-developed, and I applaud you for your work. Personally, I've had more success with Standing Out. I do think, though, that your addition of methods for strategic and clarifying thinking will find their way into the system I eventually create, although these processes might very well happen "away from" the list.<br><br>Alan:<br><br>I had trouble understanding the benefits of Doting when I first read your post. I made another attempt today and it became more clear. It's actually much closer to what I want than I first thought. My rules will be a bit more strict than yours, but I will aspire toward the same goal of grouping together as many started-but-not-finished/recurring items as possible.<br><br>--V</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2018 at 20:41 | Voluntas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Voluntas: Looking forward to details of your new system!<br><br>Following on from your idea of separate lists - I wondered if 3 lists would work?<br>One for do it now tasks, one for tasks you need to do this week and one for do it in 3 weeks. Seems a simple way of prioritising what to focus on first.<br>I suppose that is a similar principle as dotting or standing out. You are just putting those in the "do it now" tasks list in the first place. They then get done sooner.<br>If all the lists are kept clear within the designated timescales, then happy days!<br>I will give this a go for a while and see how it goes. I can't see any disadvantages at the moment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2018 at 11:13 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>MrB:<br><br>Sounds similar to DWM, which I have read about, but never implemented. One of the questions I'm addressing with the new system is "If you've got something that can't go on the list because you're not working on it now, WHERE DOES IT GO?" Hint: I'm not putting it on another list. Not for now, anyway.<br><br>I remembered why RAF didn't stick with me: If I deferred an item once, too often I found it getting deferred over and over into oblivion. I didn't want to delete it, because it still needed to be done, but I couldn't manage to get it off the list by doing it. This negatively impacted my attention in much the same way as a catch-all.<br><br>Yesterday with the new system was successful enough, and I'll return to my list in a couple of hours for more testing. (Writing this between appointments at work where I don't use a list because our scheduling and record-keeping systems make it irrelevant.) There's a mechanic that only starts kicking in at the end of the second day which I'm excited to encounter face-to-face.

Or that they have "no willpower" and therefore can't avoid eating too much chocolate cake.<br><br>The best way to get something done is to ignore the voices and just do something - anything - towards getting it done.

Put very simply like you say above, then we could all to a certain extent take a good looks at ourselves and think how silly. I'm guessing that most followers of this blog have some sort of time management issues around being too busy? <br>On too much work, there are times when that can be out of our control and I suppose just a bit of prioritising and deferring the less pressing stuff should do the trick.

To say "I'll try to do it" is just a weasel way of sitting on the fence. A few examples: "I'll try to get to your party on Saturday" (meaning I probably won't but don't want to say so), "I'll try to give up smoking starting next week" (meaning I probably won't succeed in giving it up for more than a few days, or quite likely a few hours).<br><br>Your reaction to someone saying something like that is that they're not very likely to do what they say.<br><br>On the other hand ""I will try to fit you in for your next session this weekend" means exactly what it says.
