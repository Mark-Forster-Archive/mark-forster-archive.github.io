I'm trying a tweak where I have a few different DWM lists for different areas of focus -- I suppose it's similar to Mark's recommendation to separate "work" and "home", but I'm separating things into 3-5 different areas.  So far it's helping me make sure I don't spend all day working on whatever trivial things happen to stand out -- I'm strictly limiting time spent on miscellany, and focusing on my "hot lists" of things either my manager or my wife are waiting for me to do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 October 2010 at 0:57 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Why does nuntym keep writing "+AJPM+" at the top of every post and comment?
