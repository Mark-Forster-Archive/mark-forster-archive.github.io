By doing this, you increase the motivation to work on things you care about, and clarity so that your work is more effective.  This system will only be effective in as much as you are interested in changing your life for the better.  It won't help much for keeping things the same.<br><br>This idea came to me about two months ago, and proves to be a gift from God.  I say this because it came to me suddenly in a moment of despair, and has transformed my outlook.  If it only works for me, it's still incredible.<br><br>Prior to this, I had been somewhat successful in sticking to a process of writing tasks and doing tasks, but I didn't feel I was making enough progress on things that mattered.  And when I tried to push myself harder to really work on those things, I became overwhelmed and ended up doing less.<br><br>At the beginning, I recorded some of my thoughts.

I hope to resolve this by eating better.<br>* Finances are a mess.  Get these in order and improve my outlook.<br>* Software development for business prospects is advancing too slowly.  Get back on track and make concrete advancements.<br>* Social engagement levels since COVID has been awful.  Expand and improve how well and how much I engage with others.<br>* I had been growing in my faith, but I want to put that into action.<br>* My general mood has been low, and felt things weren't going forward.  Lack of motivation often left me engaged in lots of trivial entertainment.

It wasn't planned as such.  I merely thought I'd take a break for a weekend, and by Monday my momentum died.  Not that I became entirely idle, but I ceased the process and ceased the great success it was giving me.  <br><br>Why did this happen?  Maybe something about the aphorism "don't tell people what you're doing".  Psychologists say it has a similar effect on your mind as feeling like you have already accomplished the thing, and your desire fades.  Maybe having written up the process I lost the need to prove the process.  Maybe I was overtaxed and needed to relax.  I tried getting back but motivation kept slipping through my fingers.  <br><br>Today I'm running with a theory that my labels need to change.  When you read the same things too often, they lose their vibrancy.  I had labeled each Life Area as a phrase expressing the direction of change I sought.  Today, I rewrote each of them into an eschatological description.  More plainly I state how I want to be, in each area of my life, using present tense.  So in fact each of these statements clash with my present reality, but I believe can be my future reality, and I hope to be motivated to engage with these future objectives.  If nothing else, the pondering I did to rewrite these has reengaged my soul, so I feel ready to do tomorrow.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 June 2021 at 2:10 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
