I find these discussions so interesting. One thing that they do not discuss which was the primary problem for me with GTD is the feeling of being on a hamster wheel ad nauseum. You complete next actions, but the list keeps growing and growing and growing. I never felt that I'd really completed anything. The implication that AF is mindless is way off-base, too. Rather than being mindless, I would say it's effortless. Why spend an hour or more each week trying to determine your priorities that you know will only be resisted because you haven't allowed for enough down time, for example? And someone's suggestion that you just "muscle through" the resistance sounds great in theory! Doesn't work day in and day out, especially when once again your plans aren't balanced enough. Your subconscious mind or "inner brat" if you will, makes sure you get that balance in AF. For most people I think it does the same with GTD. The difference is there's guilt and confusion when this happens with GTD.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2009 at 15:23 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Any thoughts on this comment from that thread: "With GTD, all of the thinking has been done for you, and you have quick contexts from which to narrow down to.

I think there are several people out there that make so many calls a day -- from their cell phones -- to take advantage of small windows of time.  If you are one of those, then create a separate calls list.  I see no reason why you cannot do AF and have this list too.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2009 at 17:27 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The #1 problem I see folks getting into with AF is tasks that need to be done immediately and/or on a certain date. For me, the solution is obvious (and mentioned by Mark). Any call, task that needs to be done today, or on a specified date, goes into your calendar. Period. When you start to work, you look at your calendar FIRST, and then hit your lists.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2009 at 17:40 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jim:<br><br>Thanks for drawing our attention to this discussion.

In my OneNote AutoFocus Notebook, I have a section called lists where I keep for example lists of frequently used telephone numbers (yes I know they will be in Outlook but this just works for me), a shopping list, a packing list etc.  If I felt the need to i would add a calls list there also.  At present my calls work fine from within AF.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2009 at 22:01 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Make a call list. That's why this system and this forum is so pleasant. When someone (like me) tries to complicate AF, the answer is almost always something extremely simple, logical, and, best of all, common sensical. Of course: make a call list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2009 at 2:40 | ds</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>DS:  Yes, that is why AF is so nice.  AF does not have lots of things you can NOT do.  It is a list of "list processing" rules followed by the general rule: "Do whatever works!"  GTD is more of a tangle or rules and procedures and that is what bogs people down.  And that is what makes the GTD environment a bit more hostile than this one, I belive.  On a typical GTD list you continually read a comment like: "Yeah, but that way is not the GTD way.  Let's stick to discussing "pure" GTD."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2009 at 11:32 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Some people who use GTD tend to caricature AF.<br><br>But let us not fall into the same trap and caricature GTD.  I happen to believe that they are wonderfully complementary.<br><br>Some who have not looked into GTD may be surprised to hear the GTD suggests the use of a single list if the number of active items is only 20 to 30.  It only suggests that it may be more helpful to introduce a grouping by "categories" if the list holds say 50 to 150 active items.  (And members of this forum readily acknowledge that location is another reason for introducing categories and on another thread "computer" if a lot of tasks can only be done at the computer, or "Calls" as suggested in this thread if it seems helpful etc....)<br><br>Likewise some may be surprised that GTD recommends "intuition" as the key faculty that guides you in the choice of task at any given moment.<br><br>I could go on and highlight many other features that show GTD and AF to be in accord.<br><br>But AF has shown me that there is no need to be intimidated by some of the apparent complexities of GTD and especially by two things about the action list(s), namely the encouragement to be very specific about exactly what should be done next on some project and also the tendency to be overwhelmed when the list grows pretty large. On these two points, Mark has shown that the action verb can be quite tentative in the beginning (e.g. "Think about..." or "Investigate...") and also that even a large list is manageable as long as you have a few rules to help you to stay in charge of it (and even to have a lot of fun with it.)<br><br>There is something else that tends to open a gulf between GTD and AF.  GTD markets itself to what they call "smart, capable professionals...", people who can pay a fortune to attend an International Summit  (and am I correct in concluding that you cannot contribute the the GTD discussion forum unless you have paid $480 annual subscription?)  By contrast AF is for people like me, people who represent 95% of the population who are not afraid to admit that they have trouble emptying the dishwasher unless they get a bit of help.<br><br>And AF offers an absolutely huge bonus, namely a forum visited by a wonderful group of people who offer each other support, encouragement and personal testimony that life's tasks truly are manageable.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2009 at 11:36 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>DS:  Oooops, I forgot to respond to your first question/comment.  Actually, I don't believe that GTD does your thinking for you.  I know that is what DA believes, but I have found it to not be true at all.  I know it SEEMS as though if your NAs for several projects are phone calls, having an @Call list would be great.  I found, however, that I can't make those calls without the relevant material in front of me so I need to have the project folder out and therefore, it simply makes sense to make the call while I'm working on the project, not save the calls up like some kind if "context miser" LOL ;-)<br><br>IMO, the whole notion of separating thinking from doing is not sensible, no matter how great it might seem.  For me, thinking and doing are one process.  To the extent that I separate the two, I get nothing done.  I think, then I put off doing and all I've done is thought about it.<br><br>Now this is not to say that NO amount of planning future tasks is not useful.  Shopping, for example, really needs to be planned or you come home with 4 gallons of rocky road and no milk, coffee creamer, or veggies ;-)  If you have a house renovation project it makes sense to plan ahead to buy the material you need before the weekend comes so you can get out early and make progress, rather than waste a valuable Saturday driving to stores fighting crowds.  I just think it is a bit brain dead to build a long call list before making calls and then forget the details you are calling to discuss.<br><br>One context in which this kind of thing CAN work is when one has long commutes.  My wife uses her hour drive home to make her calls and she gets a lot done in that time.  But then, she mostly works out of her head anyway.  I've seldom seen her write a list for any reason ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2009 at 11:44 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike<br><br>"Context Miser" - Love it! :-)<br><br>&lt;&lt;IMO, the whole notion of separating thinking from doing is not sensible, no matter how great it might seem.

I think, then I put off doing and all I've done is thought about it.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Now that para made me think .....<br>I would say that I can separate the two but nine times out of ten the "thinking" generates the motivation for the doing.  Sometimes I "do" but sometimes it is not the right timing.  What your comment has made me realise though is that the reason I am stuck on a few tasks is that I need to "rethink" the associated project.  (Another pearl!!)<br><br>But who told you about my shopping habits ....? :-)<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2009 at 12:29 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Christine,<br><br>Oh, the seductiveness of rocky road ;-)<br><br>Re: Thinking and Doing.  Yeah, there is no simple way to word that as it is an inherently complicated idea.  Of course you CAN separate thinking and doing ... conceptually.  They can also be separated in time, but that is sometimes more problematic.  I find that when I plan down to my level of comfort and no more ... IOW, can visualize the doing without big clouded areas I can't see through ... then I am ready to do.  But when I try to "eliminate" thinking from the "doing' process ... that is when the trouble starts.  It may SEEM as if I have it broken down to a no thinking bit (such as "Call Joe")  but then:<br><br>- Call about what?<br>- What info do I need to reference on the call?<br>- What if he asks about XYZ?  Do I have the info to answer?<br>- Will he need a credit card number?  Will I have it handy?<br>- What if I'm driving?  Can I juggle all of that while also on the phone?<br><br>It works best for me if I review the project ... call THEN, while all of the details and questions are in my mind ... and most of all, prepare for the call with notes.  In the corporate environment I would talk to people every day so if I forgot something on the Monday call, I would not seem a doofus if I brought it up on Tuesday.  Now I don't do that and I really hate calling back in five minutes saying: "We just talked and I forgot to ask.."

I had thought about it, scoped out my next action steps, put several of them in AF, actioned a few and the remainder just languished.  Why?

It's not just a matter of keeping a list of phone calls, but of having a ready-and-waiting list of small tasks where no time-consuming thought is required, and they can just be rattled through.<br><br>There is no perfect time management system for all people at all times, and we should not fall into the trap of arguing that Autofocus is it. <br><br>But that's OK. For me the benefits of AF outweigh this small disadvantage many times over!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2009 at 20:56 | ludlow</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi ludlow,<br><br>This is a very good description.  GTD really IS a good system for those that live in that kind of life.  For me, if I am 10-15 minutes early for a meeting, I have never considered going through a calls list and start making calls.  I might review the agenda for the meeting, and chit-chat with other members of the committee about other things in life, but to work non-stop -- no matter how much work I have -- is just not for me.  I have even encountered men in the restrooms in airports in stalls (sorry) talking on their cell phones.  Surely there are some times in life when we could NOT work?
