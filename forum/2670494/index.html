I would guess you don't really want to "meet ALL of your customer needs consistently" but rather, you wish to meet enough of your customer's needs so that they remunerate (pay) you now and in the future.<br>2. I suspect this is only a conflict because you more work coming in than you have the capacity to manage. I suspect that using some explicit negotiation with your customers about whether they want existing work completed or new work coming in may resolve this conflict.<br>3. It's clearly not always necessary to finish what you've started, after all, your customers sent in new requests before you were finished with the prior work! It also doesn't seem to me that you must ALWAYS respond positively to new customer requests. Why isn't "I can't handle this at this time" a possible response?<br>4. Again, if you had sufficient capacity, or knew when your customer's changed priorities, the causal connection between either of the branches would be broken.<br><br>Hope this is helpful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 April 2017 at 22:26 | Ryan Freckleton</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Customers don't always know what they "need." They know what they want right now, but they may not understand the tradeoffs in getting it or the alternatives they have not considered. The most amazing business innovations have delivered something that few customers imagined wanting or needing but turned out to be adored by (almost) all. Netflix comes to mind: renting movie discs through the mail sounded to me like the dumbest idea ever, until I had tried it for a few months, and then I couldn't imagine going back to the old way.<br><br>So I think this conflict is broken by having complete transparency with customers. Once they understand all the tradeoffs and constraints in what they are asking for, and have fully considered the alternatives, they will be able to be a partner with you in choosing how to allocate limited resources toward their goals.<br><br>If only this worked for personal work! Unfortunately, having a pretend dialog with my other selves about these tradeoffs and priorities doesn't seem to get me anywhere. It's still ultimately just me sitting here wondering what to do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 April 2017 at 23:34 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ryan, your second item hits on a key assumption that unlocks the conflict, I think. The assumption is that "taking on new work always prevents me from finishing what I've already started." This is obviously not true. <br><br>So I guess a key question is: At what point does accepting new work have an unacceptably large impact on finishing the work already started?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 April 2017 at 23:53 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie, your last paragraph hits the nail on the head. I think I made a mistake in making too much equivalence between managing personal workload and managing customer-facing work in those two conflict diagrams. They are related but not equivalent, and the customer discussion is leading away from the fundamental time management question I am trying to address.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 April 2017 at 23:57 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The work I am currently doing on high-volume high-speed low-resistance lists threatens to make this entire discussion obsolete.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/4/29/no-question-fvp.html?lastPage=true&amp;SSScrollPosition=3172">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/4/29/no-question-fvp.html?lastPage=true&amp;SSScrollPosition=3172</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2017 at 1:14 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, I am always intrigued by your new systems, and follow them closely!<br><br>But elsewhere you wrote:<br><br>&lt;&lt; A “catch all” system always ends by either building resistance to the list, or by processing endless amounts of trivia. &gt;&gt;<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/6/why-no-list-systems-work.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/6/why-no-list-systems-work.html</a><br><br>I sincerely hope and believe you will find a catch-all system that overcomes these faults, but my gut feel is that No-Question-FVP isn't it. Whenever there is stress in the system, easy stuff begins to "stand out" over the hard stuff more often than it should. <br><br>Faster processing of the easy stuff is what leads to the endless amounts of trivia.<br><br>Slow neglect of the hard stuff is what leads to resistance to the overall system.<br><br>Since resistance with NQ-FVP is so low, and processing speed is so high, I'm guessing two things will happen:<br><br>(1) It will take longer for these symptoms to appear than with other catch-all systems. <br>(2) When the symptoms do appear, they will be more pronounced.<br><br>I could be wrong, of course, and I'd be willing to give it a spin myself, if I weren't so preoccupied right now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2017 at 7:28 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>No signs of it happening yet, but of course it's early days.<br><br>Bear in mind that the high processing speed yesterday was achieved by someone suffering from severe chemotherapy side-effects!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2017 at 9:11 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm interested in the new NQ FVQ so will give it a go.

I will make sure I don't put any trivia on the list! <br><br>Also interested in evaporating cloud theory on the backlog problem. I'm have a huge backlog I just cannot clear, so it seems I will just have to live with it and manage it best I can. Currently working 3 days a week on new stuff in and 2 days on backlog. The backlog is isolated and prioritised so deadlines not missed. <br>Seraphim - how do you clear the backlogs?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2017 at 9:16 | Mr Backlog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mr Backlog:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I will make sure I don't put any trivia on the list! &gt;&gt;<br><br>It depends what you mean by trivia.

I'm hoping it will help get through everything and balance working on the backlog and new stuff.<br><br>Inevitably there have been a few causualites with such a large backlog - deadlines missed, client queries unanswered etc. I have been reducing commitments to ease the problem.<br><br>I like the idea of pulling in backlog tasks to the main list so will try that. <br><br>I'm hoping by the end of the year to be Mr Uptodate...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2017 at 10:50 | Mr Backlog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Seraphim: I think your definition of "staying on top" is not clarified enough. What do you mean *exactly* by that?<br><br>For example, if you promised your daughter to come to her baseball game next Wednesday and you said to yourself you will wear your old Giants cap to it. Now let's say, you made it to the game, but you forgot the Giants cap. Are you now on top of your work? What with all the activities you would normally do on that Wednesday afternoon? Are you on top of them if you do them on Thursday or do you have to finish them on Tuesday?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2017 at 11:12 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Backlogs: I disagree with Mark about assigning a date to re-introduce each backlog. If the date arrives and you're still working on the first, adding another will be adding one more spinning plate. I speak from experience.<br><br>Instead, use that date to ask the hard questions. Why didn't you finished the first one on schedule? Is the first one even worth continuing, or should it be deleted completely? <br><br>The deadline would also encourage you to focus on the valuable parts of the backlog. In order to meet my goal for the year, I cannot spend more than a month on this pile of magazines, or more than a week per magazine. Maybe I don't need to read the articles that don't really interest me, just to be complete. Maybe even skip those that are interesting but are about things I already know. Maybe set the question date earlier, so you have time to change how you do things, so you can meet the date.<br><br>(My problem is that I don't listen to the answers to the hard questions. I want to read every article to be complete.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2017 at 23:45 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cricket:<br><br>If I were you I'd chuck out the lot.

I put all the backlog items somewhere separate from my current work. <br><br>E.g., emails. I take all the backlogged email and put it in a separate folder and call it "backlog" with the date, e.g., Backlog May 2017. I then "start fresh" with all current and incoming email. Whenever I have some time, I clear out some of the backlog. It can sometimes take awhile, but at some point I hit a turning point and start deleting / clearing out in large swaths and it's done quickly.<br><br>There is nothing especially TOC-ish about any of this. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 May 2017 at 22:42 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christopher:<br><br>&lt;&lt; @Seraphim: I think your definition of "staying on top" is not clarified enough.

In one sense, the perceived demands on my time are ALWAYS greater than my capacity. There are always more opportunities for doing new valuable things than I could possibly ever accomplish in a thousand lifetimes. All of these represent some level of "demand". <br><br>So maybe I should narrow "perceived demand" to something like "the perceived demands which I have accepted" or "the perceived demands which I have implicitly allowed to place demands on my time and attention".

The "what" and the "why" makes perfect sense. <br><br>The challenge for me has always been the "how". <br><br>You have addressed this also, but I don't feel I've found anything that quite works for me yet, at least not in the simple and systematic way that I want it to work.<br><br>DIT uses the "audit of commitments" approach whenever you fall behind for more than 3 or 4 days. I've done that audit many times. It's helpful - yes, it's helpful. But it's also time-consuming. And it tends to be a top-down, brute-force approach. <br><br>Top-down, in the sense that I end up with a list of all my commitments, which I then need to prioritize and trim -- and a danger with any top-down approach like this is the disconnection from daily reality, the inclusion of things that I think I "should" be doing, but in actual practice never get done, at the expense of what really has traction.<br><br>Brute-force, in the sense that you have to set aside time and force yourself through the audit process. It doesn't emerge naturally in the course of daily business. Sometimes brute force is necessary in life, I suppose, but it's always jarring and interrupts the flow of things.<br><br>Your AutoFocus and subsequent systems try to solve the problem of managing commitments with a more "emergent" approach.

For example:<br><br>1. Reduce your work hours by half. That forces you to concentate on essentials.<br><br>and/or<br><br>2. Give yourself a date in the near future when you will delete all your backlogs. You have until then to deal with anything really important in them. The rest is chucked.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2017 at 12:10 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mr Backlog - <br><br>Have you tried any of the no-list systems? They help me to limit work in progress so it stays focused on what's really important, and greatly reduce the accumulation of new work that I can't finish.<br><br>Sometimes this has the effect of moving the backlog off my working time management list, and off to some other place, such as my list of projects. It's generally a lot better than the catch-all methods, but it can still be a problem -- which is why I started this post. :-)<br><br>I still think the backlogs are the result of the fundamental conflict I described at the top of this thread. And I'm still not sure how to resolve the underlying conflict. My new method ( <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2672135">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2672135</a> ) is really helping me find a great balance between focus and responsiveness:  focus on important stuff that needs to get done (which clears the hardest things out of the backlogs), responsiveness to the changing needs and demands of the day. But the fact that I have found a "balance" bothers me. "Balance" is another word for "compromise", and "compromise" is usually a "lose/lose", not a "win/win". The evaporating cloud method is supposed to eliminate these compromises. So I think the real, permanent solution is still eluding me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2017 at 15:08 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't tend to make lists, but just work straight from the source. e.g email, post or telecalls.<br>I have a small list of projects to work through at certain times of the month.<br>That seems to be most efficient for the type of work I do.<br><br>I guess we are all different and tend to develop our own methods to best handle tasks. Hence everyone seems to keep trying new methods.<br><br>I do use small lists to handle and focus on urgent tasks. However I have found that whenever I try to prioritise work, it just means other work is not done and that becomes urgent.<br><br>I wonder really if the only true solution to backlogs (per start of this blog), is to deal with everything in strict chronological order - oldest first, or those with specific due dates and chuck out everything else that is not really important until you have excess time available.<br><br>That sounds great in theory, but to actually put it into practice seems to be eluding me. I think like most of the world, more difficult tasks tend to get deferred.

It has the great advantage that non-urgent stuff gradually increases in urgency - so in theory at least everything should get done.<br><br>2) When dealing with a backlog, it's best to do the newest stuff first.

The latter sorted incoming offers of work by offering to schedule them as appointments, as they were calling in.  Those willing to make appointment and wait, would get prompt excellent service; they others would drop out as prospective customers (this time around, anyhow).  And Mick had gotten good at estimating the times the jobs would take, and so always had a full day's work, without backlog or overwhem.  Not bad, eh?  <br>        Handling customers who are unsure what they want, I'd guess they could have an appointment for finding out, and a new appointment for what they wanted, if it would take more than the first appointment and if they'd agree.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2025 at 20:33 | Serry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>These days, my answer to this question is to question the assumptions at the beginning. My solution to this is to simply deny the conflict in its entirety. <br><br>I do this by not trying to be on top of all my work and not trying to be instantaneously responsive to every possible new demand. If I don't care about either of those two things there isn't a problem. <br><br>I find what seems to matter more is the taking of action on things that matter to you. As long as you are aware of your timetables, and have given yourself a sense of what you have committed to do, then taking action works, especially if you allow your attention to remain not on all that you have to do, but on the things that matter most to you. This assumes that you are taking advantage of your foreknowledge to anticipate what is and is not needed. <br><br>Many things will naturally fall through the cracks, which you want, because that's a gentle and easy way to say no to them. If they become relevant later, then you can deal with them later. If you then allow yourself to respond naturally to interruptions that do show up (and have appropriately created an environment that prevents overwhelming numbers of distractions), I find  that they don't cause too many issues and you can fit handling them in between your biggest tasks. <br><br>The idea of not having to be on top of things all the time and not feeling the need to constantly respond to every new shiny thing is liberating. You still want to prime yourself to be aware of the new things at an appropriate pace, but you now don't have to be committed to ever doing anything about them, and you don't have to continue to review them. <br><br>This is very much in keeping with the no-list approach that Mark has talked about, and I think it ends up working better. A long list method that you review all the time I find inevitably doesn't have the right calibration of allowing things to "die" naturally, while still enabling them to "live" for the right amount of time and also, importantly, the right amount of intensity. But our brains are very good at letting things be forgotten, but they can also remember things quite well. I find that you can use your brain as a much more natural way of "letting tasks go over time" since your brain will let you naturally forget things. For me, this means that lists don't have to be weeded, as they really only let me prime myself on occasion to refresh my memory, while I can let my memory dismiss tasks on a relatively smooth gradient of time. <br><br>I find this to be a great way to undermine the problem of long lists growing too large.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 January 2025 at 7:47 | Aaron Hsu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
