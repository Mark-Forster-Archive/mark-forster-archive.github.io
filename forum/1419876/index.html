You are on retirement, yet you keep helping people like me, who are having a tough time with procrastination and time management problems, to deal with their lives in a healthier and more efficient way. For this reason I decided to donate some money. I'm just a student, so it's not much, but it is a token of appreciation for your invaluable efforts that have helped me develop myself into a positive direction, something which was decidedly lacking before I came across your website two years ago.<br><br>I wholeheartedly believe that you deserve a break after such a large volume of new posts, comments and developments from your part in the past two months, but will be checking up on the forum and website regularly for your return and the new insights that will undoubtedly follow.<br><br>Regards,<br>Tijl - Media Technology student at Leiden University in the Netherlands</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 February 2011 at 12:39 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Unfortunate post?

At times, Mark has responded to these questions with the following II'm paraphrasing)": <br><br>"Well, do what you think works".<br><br>But people aren't asking to build their own systems - besides, this dilutes the authority aspect of a system i.e. placebo effect, and turns the system into something other than SF. I believe people are asking for clarity because the rules (to some) are confusing. Which is fine - a live demo, or video - would help resolve many of these questions. Does Mark owe any of this to us? Absolutely not. However, when you launch a system with the claim: <br><br>"This is one heck of a powerful system - and I don’t think I’ve experienced anything like everything it’s capable of!"<br><br>people are going to get very excited, and this was clearly Mark's intention. So when folks start using the systen, and find it confusing, they're going to ask questions. Perhaps an FAQ would help. <br><br>I don't regret, nor do I wish to take back, my comment. However, and as previously stated, I feel bad that everyone suffers because Mark was annoyed with my comment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2011 at 13:23 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum, I rather  sympathize with you - but I also sympathize with Mark! <br><br>I think everyone here appreciates that you're not a troll, or a drive-by commenter, but someone who really wants to test SF. I hope you stick around.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2011 at 15:01 | Chris Cooper</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I appreciate the desire to understand the rules, however, the reality of this system and others by Mark is they are not like GTD in the sense that you could create a flow chart that gives you a 100% certain way of dealing with everything life may throw at you.  <br><br>Mark has purposely designed systems with much less overhead than GTD.  The result is that you get up and running faster, learn the system quicker and spend less time maintaining it.  However, the trade off is that there may be instances where there is not a hard and fast  rule to deal with a situation you are in.  Personally, I have simplified my systems and use only a couple of rules.  I trust my instincts to guide me as to what I need to do and what I can dismiss and when.  I do not look to rules for this.  I know if I write my list in one place and maintain a simple A - Z filing system I will be about as productive as I can be.  I work on what I feel like I need to work on and dismiss something when I feel it needs to be dismissed, not according to some rule that the page is full or some other criteria.  I am not saying this to be critical of SF, but to reiterate that one needs to view a system in light of their own needs and skills.  While I tend to think people tweak too much too early, the reality is there is no perfect system for everyone and you must figure out what works for you.

If a task is clogging the system in C2 and you'd rather put it away for a while, then put it away. <br><br>Obviously life changes fast sometimes and has no regard for what you put in C2.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2011 at 17:18 | OhNiners</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Right on, 09!

She no longer tries to argue us into a course of action. Instead, she looks you in the eye and says, severely, "Of course, you are free to do as you like. And of course, there are consequences to your choice." And smiles. Meaningfully.<br><br>Which is rather the point here as well. Until we have a good feel for the system, which after all works by making us face up to difficult choices early rather than late, it is hard to judge the consequences of overriding it. So I try to keep C2 de-commits to an absolute minimum. <br><br>I may relax a little when I have a better feel for the system.<br><br>The safety valve is stated by Mark as something like "You have clearly done all that it is possible to do now. Cross it out from C2 as completed and enter it in C1 for when you circumstances next permit (or in the calendar, if the trigger is date driven)". This is for circumstances where you have no choice as to what you actually do, only in what you write in your lists. <br><br>The lists should reflect reality. Action should follow the rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2011 at 20:31 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I believe Mark's SF works perfectly for Mark, but one thing that is difficult to control in these endeavors is the human element.  This system is a list that requires YOU to use YOUR intuition to determine the proper action or when something is ready.  Any system requires you to use intuition or good judgment, and there is not a replacement or program that can be written for intuition or good judgment (Mark's SF, a computer, or anything are not adequate substitutes).  It seems like what some in the community are asking of Mark is for him to write a program as a substitute for your own intuition or good judgment when no such program exists.  As a result of SF working so well for Mark, and everyone egging him on about his progress, perhaps the hype machine got a bit ahead of the finished product on this one.  <br><br>I'm not a person that has fit into the AF/SF systems because I don't do well with large lists that require me to pick things out.  I'm more of a planner, so DIT works best for me because I know exactly what comprises one day of work.  I've also borrowed from Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play.  Obviously, one system is not going to work for everyone.  <br><br>And here's the rub.  I think if Mark tells you to do what you think is best, or some similar response, maybe he is looking to you to try and resolve the issue.  With the variety of jobs that all of us are in, and how other systems on this board have developed, why not give some things a try and give feedback instead of expecting Mark to have all of the answers?  As an alternative possibility, maybe Mark is saying that in this particular situation, any system is not a substitute for your own good judgment or intuition, and SF is not designed to address those types of conflicts.  <br><br>Mark's systems have been a true blessing, and thanks to Mark for providing a forum and so many great ideas for us true time management junkies.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2011 at 22:33 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Mark's SF works perfectly for Mark"<br><br>I agree. Personally, I couldn't imagine DOING any system from the "moment I get up" (Mark does this). Still, after much TM experimentation - I'm yearning for some consistency. To achieve this, I would like to experience a system as designed by the designer. I'm thinking that SF - particularly Mark's understanding of "urgent" i.e. do the dishes - is best done the way Mark does it. Yet this raises a considerable amount of resistance for me. So I start to hack, modify, etc., and very quickly create a system I don't trust.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2011 at 23:12 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will - Very well stated!    Excellent post.   And I love the anecdote about your daughter!   :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 2:15 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>TK, some worthy thoughts there.<br><br> I think I'm finding SF quite usable even while I am very off again on again with it. I mean some time I run the system by the rules, and some time I just do what comes up, system set aside. Stuff is getting done. It's too soon to say if it's full success or not, but it feels righter than any system prior.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 3:04 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If I may add my 2 cents...<br><br>First, let's all remember that Mark didn't want to release the system before it was quite tested with good reason. It helps iron the krinckles and gives you better insight in the interactions of the parts. What you intend when you design something is not always what you get when the rubber hits the road. Plus, with some miles under your belt, it's easier to explain it. Mark released it early and I strongly believe that it was against his better judgement. Somebody (sorry, I dont remember who) had a similar setup so he had to release sooner then expected.<br><br>Also, and I agree this is a weird one, the system is very powerful and makes you super productive. It's at least my humble assessment after using it. But looking at how I used it and what really happened in terms of balance on my Kanban system, I was burning myself fast... Maybe it's just evidence that the system really works maybe too well for the standard human being ;)<br><br>Anyway, be it that Mark has felt an obligation to respond so much on the forum (meaning he just realized his priorities) or it was simply a byproduct of the system, let's cut him some slack here. I really prefer when we discuss and he jumps in with a pointer rather then when people ask him direct questions. Discovery and self thinking is part of learning after all... If you want direct advice, contract him as a consultant for his time, I'll assure you that you'll get your money's worth.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 6:53 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nicely put Erik.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 March 2011 at 8:30 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I tend to look at it this way (I've been on the net since usenet cerca 1990). When it comes to any public discussion respect is tantamount.<br><br>Mark has invited use into his home to discuss his creations. As guests we need to be respectful of Mark and the other guests. For the most part that goes on around he better than most places I've seen since the days of the old Palm_GTD yahoo group. This is a great place to have wine &amp; cheese -or- beer &amp; chips and discuss this stuff. <br><br>It's also important that we feel comfortable being able to discuss the topics or the value of this place ceases to be.<br><br>We've gathered here because we long to share tips and tricks and systems for managing our compliments. Mark has built this place on to of his creations that we come to try them and to discuss them. It's a compliment to Mark and the community that we feel free to discuss and debate these and tangent systems here. I applaud Mark for not restricting the discussions to just his core systems. I think that is the key that makes this a valuable space.<br><br>Mark has created a beautiful set of systems. I my humble opinion these systems are more heuristics than rules when you distill them down to their core essence. They guide you to make good decisions; but as a human you have to make good choices when seen through the filter of the heuristics. Mark has never really created a GOLDEN RULE in any of his systems, that would require him to stand behind you and hit you over the head when you break a rule. While Mark might enjoy that at times; cloning is sadly an imprecise science at this time.  Yet, sometimes thing here get excited when a community member tries to explain in GOLDEN RULE terms how to use the system. Beware that bear trap; it has peanut butter covered knife blades.<br><br>Mark is the example to follow, he knows the system from his implementation and his life. He always answer questions by reminding us if he doesn't know something; his answers are always well rooted in his world and you know it when you read them. Others here need to develop and hone that skill, myself included.  :)   <br><br>For example; I started a small discussion on using SFv3 in an IT Job space. Mark made some good comments saying he doesn't know IT but that these "xxxx" where his thoughts. I respect that. I had hoped to discuss how SFv3 worked for other IT people and their work loads. Sadly the defenders of the GOLDEN RULES joined that thread and mostly politely told me I didn't know how to break my work down correctly. That was sad; because I'm a 30 year veteran of the industry and I own my business; I know how to break my work down. I had hoped to have have a nice tangent discussion on SFv3 and how great it made my life so far and how others were handling the bumps and corner cases. Instead my discussion was driven closed by those that defended the rules (which wasn't Mark btw). Because of that; I like Mark took a mutli day break from reading the forums.<br><br>I'll ease back in again and I understand why Mark needed a break after reading the threads. In the end let the systems stand on their own merits. Let's discuss using them and succeeding with them in our worlds; but if we can stop trying to defend them we can have some awesome dialogs about how they work in a variety of spaces; places and situations.<br><br>As far as Mark getting compensation for this system I think he should; since all of the accounts to post here are hand approved these days; I challenge everyone that has posted more than two questions to hit the donate button.  It would be very simple for Mark to require a donation to get a "post-enabled" account on this site; he doesn't but we can do it voluntarily.<br><br>My thoughts only you mileage will vary, but they get me from place A to B in a timely manner.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2011 at 17:12 | Bob Pankratz</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim, <br><br>Why, thank you.<br><br>Bob,<br><br>I'm still at the stage where I'm learning by seeing how you can apply the system in the corner cases. This often means following a train of thought through to it's logical conclusion, THEN standing back and applying common sense (with which, my Beloved tells me, I have not been bountifully endowed). So far, the rules stand up fairly well, but I am far from mastering SF, even to the basic level of getting through my list every day.<br><br>So please accept my thoughts in the spirit of someone struggling with the same problems. Even if I had mastered SF, I hope I would not be foolish enough tell others how to do it.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://twistedbyjacks.blogspot.com/2011/03/dont-help.html">http://twistedbyjacks.blogspot.com/2011/03/dont-help.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2011 at 17:38 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wow, Bob that's quite the post.  The first half is right on.  The second half is well written but confuses me.  I'm not sure I understand where it's coming from.  <br><br>Was it my posts that turned you off?  How?  I thought you were struggling to adapt the system, and looking for advice on how to manage.  Was I wrong?<br><br>I don't consider myself a defender of rules; just someone who tries to offer constructive suggestions.  We were trying to be helpful, but you say here we were harmful. :-(</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2011 at 17:44 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nope no one offended me; the discussion I was chasing just took a left turn, it happens, and that usually takes a lot of effort to re-explain and get the topic back on to the central theme. I was only using it as an example about how simple stuff goes weird and what unexpected affects that can have. A straw-man example if you will.<br><br>What I have noticed over time is that topics here often take that left turns quickly; usually by people that are trying to help. In general, intentions are good; execution varies....  :) Citing the rules is a quick way to respond to someone but it's often not a comprehensive response. If you'll notice citing the rules is rarely Mark's first answer to a question. So my point was we need to learn from that; since he's the host.<br><br>But someone else correctly referenced personality types elsewhere and that really sums up the fact that we all have a unique filter on things and no one really gets up out of bed in the morning seeking to be a problem. Well maybe my 6 year old son does; but that would be my fault....<br><br>Unfortunately the effort to get back on topic can be exhausting; and that was one of my core points I failed to make. On the net it's harder to get to your topic and stay on topic because of the lack of non-verbal cues.  When it is exhausting, I take a break; other times I'm busy and I just wait to comeback and redirect. So I totally see Mark taking a break because he's constantly trying to stay on topic; and help. I imagine his SFv3 has a project on it called "Publish book on cat herding in 2011". <br><br>In any case it's often good to think about a post you read; and wait at least some period of time to respond, make sure you understood the post. I usually wait several hours after reading a new thread before joining in the first time; once I'm in the thread I then engage more quickly. Now that's to say I don't do the occasion two second, poorly thought-out response that make english appear to be my 2nd language...., but the taste of constant shoe leather over the years has caused me to consider how frequently I go there.<br><br>My general observation is that we commonly miss the chance on the forums to have good discussions about APPLICABILITY and tend towards discussions about execution and rules and personal views of urgent etc.  Applicability is a deeper discussion, requiring us to understand each others world problem first. For frequent visitors and contributors we should be able to get there as a community. Someone else put it best; how can I use the system to get my work done; that's a good question. How will the rules tell me what to do with out making a decisions; that's an unrealistic question... both types of discusses should fit in the forums without a threads morphing into "how-to's".<br><br>Maybe we just need a good FAQ on the system; and when that fails maybe a well placed spanner to the forehead. A quick answer to all questions on the forums is "your not following the rules correctly"; or something along those lines; sometimes the threads here need to explore the shape the work is taking and it's rhythms. The rules are there; and we have how-to threads but not everything thread is a how-to discussion.<br><br>SFv3 works great for my work; the fact that my work is so very different from Mark's is a very powerful statement about SFv3. Discussions about why it works, I find very interesting. and we can have that discussions elsewhere.<br><br>This thread was about the recent events. If Mark has left the room; then everyone just needs to pause; raise their game in his absence and wait for him to comeback with fresh wine &amp; cheese.<br><br>And now my SFv3 list says I need to post this and go make donation to the site; so I'm going to do that. <br><br>I look forward to future discussions here after I get some work done  :)  Those that know me as "ratz" from over the years know I'll be around; many good discussions yet to be had.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2011 at 19:10 | Bob Pankratz</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In your case, I did wait several hours before entering the discussion.  I guess it wasn't exactly clear what kind of discussion you sought.  (I can't speak for the other participants though.)<br><br>&lt;&lt;how can I use the system to get my work done; that's a good question. .... both types of discusses should fit in the forums without a threads morphing into "how-to's".&gt;&gt;<br><br>Are you sure that's what you meant?  "Tell me how to  (how I can) use the system to get my work done" should not morph into a how-to thread?  That's confusing.  This concept of a thread that's not a how-to sounds interesting.  Maybe you can start another one and I'll do my best not to morph it. :-/<br><br>A FAQ is a a good idea.  A spanner, not sure how that will help.  Do you mean a literal spanner to hit someone or a metaphorical spanner to tighten loose bolts? :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2011 at 19:33 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Could this be an NT vs SJ thing?   :-)     (cf.

I mean some time I run the system by the rules, and some time I just do what comes up, system set aside. Stuff is getting done. It's too soon to say if it's full success or not, but it feels righter than any system prior.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Ditto. I was home using it for a week + and it was great. I went back to work and only picked it up an evening or maybe two during the first week back. I worked it all weekend. Then again, I've worked it one evening thus far this week. And it feels good. <br><br>I've been wanting/hoping to start using it at work and it's been slow going. I'm a teacher and many/most things just roll along. But today was a testing day across the board and I was able to add a lot to my newly started work list and work it throughout the day. I'm hoping the 'use it when you need it/ leave it when you don't' that I'm finding so helpful/freeing at home will make it the first useful system for me at work. <br><br>Bob Pankratz: <br><br>Thanks for stating that you are/were ratz. I found a post of yours very helpful at the DA/GTD forum on AF.

And yes I wasn't clear about in my wording about how-to's suffice it to say my vanished post very eloquently answered your question and was free of typos and word selection errors..... Any how what I was trying to say was that I meant to separate discussions of how to do the motions and movements of SFv3 from those that addressed it's applicability to solve problems different from what Mark intended it to do.<br><br>The spanner; yeah I could use that for Square space right now...  :)<br><br>Malisa you are welcome; hopefully you don't regret it. I've been dragging people along for 10 years going all the way back to the life-balance forums when somebody mentioned DA/GTD and this long strange journey began. I know that there are at least 10 of us here on the forum the routinely find each other again, I don't think we are cylons but you never know. I don't know if it's cool or pathetic that googling "ratz GTD" will get you just under 6 pages of results that are 100% excerpts from those 10 years of discussing this topic and creating solutions to get stuff done...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2011 at 2:04 | Bob Pankratz</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wait, you mean he's THAT ratz?  I feel I'm in the presence of a legend...
