One thing is confusing me so:<br><br>Do I need to enter "all" tasks I have available to me in my list? I work from home so I don't have a separate work/home list. My main issue is that as a Software Developer, I use a lot of digital task managers because clients need access to them. This means other people can "assign" tasks to me there.<br><br>So my question is: Do I have to sync all of those tasks with my paper list? Or should I just have a repeating task "Work on project X"?<br><br>-- Felix Geisendörfer aka the_undefined</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 8:46 | Felix Geisendörfer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ou enter "all" tasks I have available to you. Little by little the system will sort and eliminate all tasks. This is a good way to get acustomed to the method. But later you will may be need to extract some tasks somewhere else.

I do all and if i don't it is because i have decided or min subcioncious has decided for me NOT to do it. And it is great.

I plan to try that anyway. Sometimes having a "work on bug #1234" on the same list as "call the doctor" is a little awkward.<br><br>Mark answered this to me, and he supported the idea of keeping the detail on a separate list.<br><br>It'd be interesting to hear how it's going for you.<br><br>Walter</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 10:26 | Walter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Felix:<br><br>The basic answer is to do it the way that works best for you. It may take a little experimenting to find out what does. There's nothing wrong with subsidiary lists. These can be easily accessed by putting "Work on Project X" or "Telephone Call List" on your AF4 list.<br><br>It also doesn't matter if some tasks are on both the subsidiary list and the main list. So I might have a Telephone Call List, but "Call Maria" is also on my AF4 list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 10:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Felix &amp; Mark<br><br>I run AF4 master list in a Moleskien note book which covers both personal and professional, plus I set up subsidiary lists as necessary (these may be manual or electronic depending on need to share with others). I also work from home and have multiple "roles" for different clients and for personal commitments. I do as Mark describes in his last post to make things more manageable. I have specific project lists where necessary, e.g. a specific work project or a home renovation project and have work on project x on my AF list, but when an item bubbles to the top from a project list or telecall list etc,  I also then add that as a specific item to my AF list. This then helps me focus on that, but I still have a reminder through having "work on project x" to revist the projects full task list.<br><br>I still also use elements of DIT if I know I am going to have a (rare) day to just crack through things and I'll draw out a list of key things for the day, but always include an item for AF4!<br><br>Finally, for my time sensitive items or long range date related actions, e.g. home maintainence, insurance renewals, tax preparation etc, I run a 43 folder tickler file system which means that I can be sure not to miss time sensitive items.<br><br>This combination really works well for me and is very easy to maintain, it has to be I have a super active 5 year old too, and I have been way more effective since I pulled these elements together. <br><br>Hope that helps. Marks invaluable advice and responses to questions has helped me get to this place, which I know is similar and yet different from some others. We are all so individual in our needs that one style could not fit all. What I have learnt is that it is critical to do what works for you. By that i don't necessarily mean tweaking as use AF4 in the way mark instructs, it is the supplementing of additional solutions around AF4 which make it work for me, whilst preserving the integrity of the system.<br><br>Sorry for the rather long post, but i hope that helps. It's also enabled me to give an update to the forum on my progress!<br><br>Titch</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 19:42 | titch</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
