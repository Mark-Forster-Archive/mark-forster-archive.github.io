Taking <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/11/3/thoughts-on-the-long-list-high-speed-high-volume.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/11/3/thoughts-on-the-long-list-high-speed-high-volume.html</a> as my inspiration.<br><br>- reduce resistance to zero<br><br>How would you do that?<br><br>Rapid Scanning is one tool, as you don't resist what you don't stop to think about.  Provide ready access to "things you want to do next" so there's no resistance due to pressure to do the wrong thing. <br><br>Little-n-oftening is another tool, you don't much resist little things.  <br><br>Beeminder is another angle. If a system provides a visible score that makes you want to win, that positive motivator overcomes the small negative resistance to make you want to do tasks, even the hated ones.  <br><br>One further trick is to make using the system so effortless that you don't resist picking it upFinally, jettison whatever remains that you really don't want done. <br><br>I'm taking an the Beeminder concept as my guess on how to up the tempo. Making success more visible and motivating more success, through the design of the task management system could be the key breakthrough to achieving lasting flow. <br><br>Next up, pondering all Mark's claimed ancillary benefits.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 November 2017 at 17:34 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>&lt;&lt; mark's e-novella &gt;&gt;<br><br>I wasn't thinking in terms of a novella, more something on the pattern of Proust's "A la Recherche du temps perdu".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 November 2017 at 21:12 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1,267,069 word count?

I am talking about groups of unactioned tasks surrounded by crossed-out tasks, especially the oldest ones.  Lately these kinds of tasks have been "standing out" and I get conniptions breaking them down to lessen their resistance or doing just a little of them to start the ball going, then after that I do not even want to look at the list sometimes.<br><br>And yes, I had been using the "noncomparative unbaggaged Standing Out".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 November 2017 at 21:50 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym:<br><br>&lt;&lt; 1,267,069 word count?

(5T and No List FVP worked best for me)<br><br>That cleared that up for me. I could establish more and better routines, I had systematic break throughs and I got so used to tackle the "hard" stuff, that resistance completely vanished.<br><br>When I went back to a catch-all list, the main source for resistance was somewhere in the DDD process. For some tasks this came too fast, for others too late, this somehow gave a slight uproar of the resisters again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 November 2017 at 2:42 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A line of thought I have been playing around with is that resistance is perceived future effort of a task or a list. It has nothing to do with the size of the task or list, but how you view it. <br><br>A solution that helps me view my list in a better light is to take a very small physical step (usually less than 30 seconds) on everything in my list (making sure to re-enter everything). This resets my perception of my list with less resistance, because I have made it more clear to myself of the work that actually needs to be done.<br><br>Same goes for a single task with resistance. Do a baby step towards getting the task done (I'll just get the file out) and this step will reorient your mind to the work ahead of you. <br><br>I often find the old pespective was clouded with misguided judgements, and as soon as I gain a new, more realistic perspective, resistance fades. <br><br>This effect very well may be from the little bit of progress I have made instead of my perception of the task or list, but I think there could be something here.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 November 2017 at 3:01 | Connor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; I'm early stages of trying a new process aimed at minimizing resistance, and so far: minimal resistance. :) But it's early stages so time will tell. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I would love to hear what it is!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 November 2017 at 3:05 | Connor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find if I action a task the first time I ever look at it, there is minimal resistance.

Any time we fail to do something in timely fashion, though we knew it was important, and afterwards we regret the choice and the consequences --  I would name that decision to delay, and the reasons behind it, Resistance.  Whether there were good reasons or weak reasons, those are the Resistance.  And whenever the reasons are Weak, we should endeavor to overcome them so that the better things are done more efficiently and more often.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 November 2017 at 13:49 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If resistance doesn't exist at all, then what is stopping us from completing tasks?<br><br>Is it that we are not in the perfect context, such as mood, location, energy, time of day?

So far, the discussion reminds me of Eli Goldratt's thesis that "conflicts do not exist in reality" -- rather, they are the result of incorrect assumptions. By challenging the assumptions and showing at least one of them to be invalid, the conflict is not merely resolved, but is shown to have never actually had any substance at all. <br><br>Perhaps "resistance" is similar.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 November 2017 at 18:20 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have a feeling Mark's response will be in the lines of two of his previous blog posts, <br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/2/6/the-natural-selection-of-tasks.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/2/6/the-natural-selection-of-tasks.html</a> and <br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/2/7/natural-selection-changes-the-emphasis.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/2/7/natural-selection-changes-the-emphasis.html</a><br><br>And if so then yes it would be very similar to what Seraphim said, but less of incorrect assumptions and more of a different paradigm.<br><br>Basically, if you think of your task list as "A comprehensive list of everything that needs to be done" then that will necessarily give you more resistance because there are things you have to do, whether you like to or not.<br><br>But if you look at your task list as "A wide-ranging list of everything that you might do" then there simply is no resistance because you don't &lt;have&gt; to do &lt;anything&gt;, much less everything, but the things that you want to do.  The things that you were "resisting" to do just become things that you don't want to do, or those you want to do but you're not ready to do yet.<br><br>Of course, I might be oversimplifying things and stating things what Mark wants to say incorrectly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 November 2017 at 20:08 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Unless you've changed your thinking entirely in the last week, I don't believe you.

The child can clean the floor, quickly or slowly or not at all according to its state of mind.

This is the source of the resistance.<br><br>I agree with a lot of what you are writing here, but I much prefer a different way of expressing it.  Resistance is a state of mind, but with the right attitude you don't have to engage in it.  In this respect I think Frank Herbert (or his character) was mostly correct in this famous quote from Dune:<br><br>&lt;&lt;I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

Then how do we reconcile the times that, when we use "standing out", we pick tasks that causes "resistance" in us?<br><br>But as Mark is saying, the real question is, is it really "resistance"?<br><br>What is "resistance" anyways?  As most will agree, "resistance" is what we feel when we have to do a task, but we don't want to, and so we would rather not do it.  <br><br>This, to me, sounds suspiciously close to the classical definition of "fear."   Fear is what we feel towards a future evil which we deem either not surmountable or barely so, and the response is to escape because the cost is too high.  This is opposite of the emotion "daring" or, as we moderns call it, "excitement": it is what we feel towards a future great evil, and the response is to fight because the rewards are highly desirable.<br><br>And yet we all have heard that "fear" and "excitement" are actually almost the same physiologically. In fact, modern medicine calls the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system the "fight or flight response", whose function is, as the name implies, to place the body on high alert and make available its emergency reserves of energy.  Thus, the only main difference to fear and excitement is how we will use this excited state, either to flee or to fight.<br><br>Now here is the thing: if the subconscious really does know what we truly want, and yet it triggers our sympathetic nervous system on picking a task, is it because we actually want to escape doing the task, or is it because the subconscious wants us to be energized for a hard but rewarding task ahead?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 November 2017 at 20:42 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Then how do we reconcile the times that, when we use "standing out", we pick tasks that causes "resistance" in us? &gt;&gt;<br><br>I don't know.

If you (or your child) is resisting something, it's often because of one of the things in STRESS. Steps, Thinking, Research, Emotion/trauma, Sensory issues, Self-care.<br><br>Like NAs, context, energy, and all the rest of GTD's categories, most people don't need to think about them for every single task. However, it a task is not getting done, looking at those reasons often explains why. Once we know why, we can do something about it.<br><br>If I notice a pattern, I work on it. Currently I'm resisting things that need high-accuracy, since I haven't been sleeping well. The problem isn't resistance, it's lack of sleep and lack of confidence. Change the system so I catch mistakes sooner, and am able to fix them more easily. Also, get more sleep!<br><br>Steps : Pretty much DA's Next Action idea. Thinking : Negative self-talk making you feel worse about the project. Research : Need more data (ask Bob what store he went to). Emotion/trauma : Is it associated with a negative experience? Often simple, but can get complicated. Sensory issues: For Aspergers and some ADHD, this can make a huge difference. Both understimulating (it's too boring to hold our attention) and over-stimulating (too hot, too itchy). Self-care : food, sleep, rest, socialization, exercise, etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 November 2017 at 0:22 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well, Mark, those responses leave me baffled.

You should just say I don't want to do this now and move on.<br><br>What your saying (correct me if I'm wrong) is we should find the reasons we don't want to do a task at this moment (energy, mood, time of day, location) and try to correct for them. And these reasons we don't want to do something at this moment make up this feeling of resistance to doing a task, which is just to say you don't want to do the task now.<br><br>Where Mark would say 'I don't want to do this now, I will move on', your saying, 'I don't want to do this now, let me figure out why, and make myself want to do it.'<br><br>Personally, I think Mark is more on target here, given my description. We should not try to change ourselves to get us to do something. My list is long, I'm sure there is a task on it I want to do right now. If I wrote down the reasons why I didn't want to do a task I would probably come up with ten to twenty. Thats too many variables to try and control. Instead lets just line up the task where all those variables are true, and move forward on the task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 November 2017 at 20:16 | Connor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I don't know what to make of your response to nuntym &gt;&gt;<br><br>In my response to nuntym I said that it had never happened to me that I've picked a task that caused resistance in me.<br><br>Here's an extract from the instructions for the original Autofocus, which go back to 2009:<br><br>"Go through the page more slowly looking at the items in order until one stands out for you.<br><br>"This is the heart of the system. Don’t try to prioritise items mentally - this will interfere with the balance between the rational and intuitive parts of your mind. Instead wait for a feeling of release about an item. It’s hard to describe but easy to recognise. You just feel that the item is ready to be done. If you go on down the page, you may find that you feel drawn back to that item. Once you get that feeling about a task all resistance to doing the task vanishes, and it becomes easy to do."<br><br>That's what I though about it then - that resistance to doing the task vanished. Now I prefer to think that resistance was never there in the first place. It was just that the time or the energy or the opportunity or whatever wasn't right. <br><br>If you think in terms of the "right time" then the fact that something hasn't yet stood out for you doesn't worry you. You just carry on until the time is right. No need to analyse why - your intuition will already have all that well in hand. Conscious examination will only get in the way.<br><br>If you think in terms of "resisting" a task then you will actually start to believe that you are resisting it and the resulting emotions, worry, frustration, etc will start to actually prevent you from doing it.<br><br>In support of this, several people have reported that Autofocus is more effective when the "dismissal" rules are removed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 November 2017 at 23:49 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Connor:<br><br>Yes, you've said it pretty well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 November 2017 at 23:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting post!<br><br>I recall in "do it tomorrow" Mark wrote something about resistance and a test on the lines of:-<br>If you do an easy task one day and succeed and then do another task the next day and make it slightly harder and repeat.

I had generally taken the phrase to mean that as I scan by, the task seems to go "pick me, pick me", and then upon picking it (if it is indeed doable) I attempt to work it.  And yes, sometimes the task is not one I particularly cared to do at the moment, but it is one which seems important to do.  <br><br>This then is where notions of resistance and my present discussion of thinking through the wants comes into play.
