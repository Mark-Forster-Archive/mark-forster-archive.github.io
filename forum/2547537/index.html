Anyone else have experience using it? I've been tempted but it seems somewhat complicated to get up and running. I'm also afraid that if it actually does work really well and I grow to rely on it, six months from now the "beta" version will transition into a paying model. <br><br>     I like scheduling systems simply because they allow you to set up a realistic amount of work for a given day, and everything you set out to do will be accomplished provided you follow the schedule. I had a lot of success using SuperMemo Plan: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.supermemo.com/help/plan.htm">http://www.supermemo.com/help/plan.htm</a> . It is very easy to drag tasks and move them around, so if you are meeting resistance with a task, you can drag forward something more appealing and work on it right away.<br><br>     Anyway, I have stopped using SuperMemo. I like the basic idea of being able to lay out estimated times for a day, and to move them around easily. I set up something similar in Excel, but I would really like to somehow implement this type of scheduling on pen and paper. Cal Newport has a few posts about that here: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/09/29/deep-habits-three-recent-daily-plans/.">http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/09/29/deep-habits-three-recent-daily-plans/.</a> I've tried the emergent task planner (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-planner/)">http://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-planner/)</a> or the pomodoro technique, but I find they both make it easy for unstructured time to leak into the day (ie you can finish a 25-minute block of work and then mess around for 20 minutes before attempting the next block of work).<br><br>     After watching the World Cup last year I thought about making firm schedules on paper but incorporating the idea of "injury time". If a task is scheduled from 1pm to 2pm, but you are interrupted from 1:10pm to 1:20pm, then you still finish up the task at 2pm but you count 10 minutes of "injury time", which is made up later -- either the end of the day, or the next day maybe tack on an extra 10 minutes to the same task. Haven't tried it though as it doesn't seem flexible enough. <br><br>    So I'm just wondering if there are any other "scheduling junkies" who have good pen and paper implenetations, or ... switching gears ... is it worth diving into SkedPal?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 October 2015 at 15:40 | Simon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If you give Skedpal a try now, as part of the public beta, you can get free lifetime access to the app.  <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://perfect.mytimedesign.com/explaining-my-absence-and-why-you-are-invited-to-join-a-beta/">http://perfect.mytimedesign.com/explaining-my-absence-and-why-you-are-invited-to-join-a-beta/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 October 2015 at 17:22 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Seraphim: your link has led me to the writings of Francis Wade. I have been reading "Perfect Time-Based Productivity". I'm curious to see how he thinks someone could pull off scheduling their "time demands" as he calls them, instead of just lists, especially if you have a lot of unplanned "fire fighting" type of work that ruins one's schedule. I like how he structures it so that you are intended to start where you are and implement changes gradually rather than adopting a new method altogether and then falling off it when the enthusiasm wanes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 November 2015 at 2:22 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Don R - They recommend you put your largish tasks into SkedPal (30 minutes+), and then put all your other smallish tasks in clumps or groups, and enter in some blocks of time to deal with those groups.   <br><br>Once everything is entered, you push a "reschedule" button, and SKedpal looks for free time on your calendar where to schedule all these tasks.   You can set deadlines and priorities, and you can set "zones" or "maps" of your time so it knows when you prefer to do certain kinds of work (for example, "work" tasks from 8-5 and "personal" tasks in the evenings or weekends; or creative work for your high-energy times; or whatever works for you).   Skedpal then takes all this into consideration when it schedules things.<br><br>This means you still need some way to track and group the smallish tasks, and I haven't seen any specific guidance around that.   <br><br>For myself, I just continued entering everything in FVP, and then set up regular recurring "FVP Time" in Skedpal.   While working FVP, if I would come across larger pieces of work that needed special attention (they are important or critical work items) and FVP wasn't giving me the results I wanted, I'd cross them off FVP and enter them into Skedpal.  Then I'd hit "reschedule" from time to time to get an updated calendar.<br><br>In theory, this is supposed to be able to be flexible enough so that when interruptions and fire-fighting pull you away from your scheduled work, when that stuff is done, you can just come back to your computer and hit "reschedule" and SkedPal will give you a new current schedule.   For me, I have too little discretionary time and SkedPal was always getting clogged up and couldn't find time for all the stuff I had thrown at it.   I had expected that, but also thought it would be more sophisticated in helping me figure out how to deal with the overcommitted calendar.<br><br>So together with those issues, and several technical issues resulting from my employer's firewall and security settings, I've put my SkedPal evaluation on hold and am back to FVP.   They just released a new version with some fixes that may address my technical issues, so I might go give it another try.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2015 at 4:40 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello ! <br><br>I made a 1 week try. ie I keept my pretty new notebook only for journaling. I mean british/american journaling not French. <br><br>Each evening I wrote all what happened in my professionnal life. How I reacted, how others did. And wrote all about my thoughts about it. I did not make a lot of sentences. The basic idea was to follow my brain as I could... <br><br>I focused on one subject at a time. I tried to put all about it and then i jumped a line, put a bullet in front of the new subject and did it again. <br><br>I noticed each day, I had about 3 to 9 subjects. <br><br>I did not wrote any thing about notes about clients, buildings. I took a paper page for each item and wrote all about it then put it in my inbox for a later processing like GTD. <br><br>The result is really astonishing. I remember better. I feel more focus. I feel I think better. Controling what I did makes me realised that I skiped 70/80% of the items and sunject for a better focusing. What I dit was the most important/ Urgent/ and core in term of future results I guess. <br><br>It makes me realize that what is the most important is more what to do than recording in details what I have done. At the end of the day my daily page is full of ideas and sunjects that are fuly important for me without any details which overwhelmed me. <br><br>I will follow this method of professionnal journaling. <br><br>On anpther hand I also have another note book for french journaling which is for me if I rightly understood a psychological journaling about my life and feelings.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 November 2015 at 19:01 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter, you write:<br><br>&gt;&gt; I made a 1 week try. ie I keept my pretty new notebook only for journaling.

Please explain.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 November 2015 at 0:55 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Christopher, <br><br>I wrote a thread about it but don't remember where. What I understood is that there are many kinds of journal. You can do it as an historical reporting of what happened in your business life and how you reacted about it, or you can do it as a conversation with yourself about yours feelings and so on, but then you dont focus on business it is more about your plans, yours desire... It is more like a conversation with yourself. <br><br>American/British journal seems more about historical situation. French seems to be more about projection on your life and focusing on feelings.<br><br>I don't know if I rightly understood this. What I know is that these 2 kinds of journaling are the 2 faces of the same coin. <br><br>For beeing practical, I use these 2 journal with 2 different books. A blue A4 spiral notebook where I record my personal and spiritual life. I explain how I feel and how I suffer in my life and try to find some solution. So reading it later I can see my evolution and correct my mistakes for the future. I also take decision. I do it only when I feel it. When I really need to do it. I can write 5/6 page at one time or only 10 lines. I also use a leather note book I recently bought. Here i write day per day sometime in the morning after a good sleep. This journal is perfect for focusing and collecting ideas about a subject and I can see at a glance what I did about something. <br><br>I read theses journal frequently and report actions on my lists.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 November 2015 at 7:55 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I haven't visited this forum much since I retired a little over a year ago and no longer needed a good, robust task management system.

Since tasks, notes, and events are all recorded as they occur under each individual day's entry, unactioned tasks get further away and harder to find, especially if you're taking a lot of notes and tracking projects and things (like your NCAA bracket - ugh).<br><br>But I read about "The Bounce" system (I haven't been here in a few months) and thought about how I might keep one continuous list. Here's what I'm trying - tasks get dedicated pages. Once I put a task on the first line of a page, tasks are all that go on that page. When I fill a page up I turn to the first empty page and start another task page. At the start of each day I draw a line under the last task and write the date.<br><br>So far, so good. It's nice to see tasks grouped together again. And The Bounce system solves a number of other problems (as documented by Mark elsewhere); plus it's kind of fun.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2017 at 22:54 | Zane</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's too much, isn't it?! The Bullet Journal method. Truly productive people don't overorganise their lists. They DO make lists, though, and, like Richard Branson, prioritise a bit. You don't need any more structure, or protocol, because it quickly becomes onanistic and self-defeating, not least because you spend more time organising than doing.<br><br>In my opinion, Alan Lakein covered it completely in 1973.
