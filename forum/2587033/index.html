So I'd take a pad and I'd write them all down on the way home. And then I would crumple the list up and throw it out," he says. "On my way to work I'd write the list again. And you become one with your list.

When he'd inspect our rooms once a week, we got a lash for anything out of place even if it was only a foot off... or we had to explain our reasoning for putting it in a different place.<br><br>He worked with the same surgical nurses for years on end yet before surgery he'd always check their instrument tray.  They had to set it up so that he could see at a glace that the needed instrucments were there.  It was imprinted in his mind.  Then they were free to set up the tray to suit them.<br><br>People have always teased me by saying that I'm too methodical and my home is too unpleasantly clean and ordered.  They said that it is unwelcoming.  To me, it's heaven.  My husband was once positively shocked that when the electric went out, I was able to shower, dry my hair, apply my make up and get dressed in the dark.  I already knew by rote where everything was. Lol!  I also had good practice when I was temporarily blinded as a kid.  What my dad taught me really came in handy then.  It was also a really great test for practicing finger patterns on my musical instruments.  I was unable to cheat by glancing.  LOL!<br><br>It really makes life much easier (but I'm not as nearly precise as my Dad taught me, just precise enough for it to work.

I'm still battling the big C but I TRY to remain optimistic after 2 years of this. I'm thinking that EVENTUALLY they'll get it all out. Meanwhile, I just try my best to carve out a decent enough life when they carve me!  LOL!  <br>I TRULY APPRECIATE your kind thoughts.<br><br>Hi Nico<br>I've been living like that for over 60 years and I still need a list.  It depends quite a bit on how complicated your life is, how much you're depended on and how much you're trying to do and natural propensities such as how good your memory is.  Some lifestyles and/or jobs must have a reminder system to properly meet all of your responsibilities, move forward your ambitions and keep track of a full appointment book.  I don't think that I ever not needed to write things down.  This system simply works great for keeping yourself in good habits of living and working. on whatever it is you're doing that benefits from good organization and habits.  Believe it or not, the structure also aids in carving out more freedom and time for enjoying hanging loose which I also love!  Bottom Line: Don't set yourself up for certain failure by expecting this to be an overlay of everything in life.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 April 2016 at 19:11 | Learning as I go</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
