I'll thank Mark for that to my dying breath.  It's beneficial on so many levels and can be implemented in so many ways. It's a wonderful launch pad to start my work because I both look forward to doing it and feel the pride of sticking to it.  It can be used to get rid of backlogs or any unwanted work, to advance a deadline project, to give birth to a new project, learning or habit formations until it has legs of it's own , a venue to inspire challenge.......see, the possibilities and benefits are practically endless.  Thanks, Mark!  This aspect of DIT is golden!

I was not where I could update my calendar when it dawned on me that I could solve my problem of always forgetting these.  But thanks to AF, they are on there now!<br><br>And If they pop up when I can't or don't want to do them, they will be added to AF as actionable tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 0:17 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I see three (at least) distinct things going on here:<br><br>1) Tasks<br>2) Deadlines<br>3) Routines<br><br>IMO, only tasks go on the AF list.  Routines (like meditate, or exercise) are on their own lists and I try to habituate those.  Deadlines go on the calendar or they will not get linked to the time they are due.  I'm of the mind to not make AF do more than it can effectively do.  I don't have "Service Car" on AF because it is dependent on the millage.  I do, however, have a routine to clean out the car on Saturday and then I check the millage ... at which point, if I figure I'm about ready to take it in, I put "Service Car" in the Calendar for 07:00 next Saturday morning.  Notice that this example uses Routine and Calender but not AF.  AF is to tell me what odd things need doing which are not linked to time (deadline).  Now if the deadline were a long way off for a large level of effort task (like writing a book) I'd use AF and Calender and probably also Routine for that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 3:53 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For me it is really important to keep routine tasks in AF.  Putting those routines in has enabled me to identify a lot of factors surrounding the way I do them, when I do them, why I do and how long I do them.  I have always struggled with a high boredom factor with many routine tasks - that is all but eliminated within AF.<br><br>I would say that my 3 most "useful" items in AF are<br><br>Check email<br>Check schedule<br>and <br>Thinking Time<br><br>Check email (a) stops me checking every 5 minutes and (b) somehow has enabled me to focus better during the time spent, with the result that I have already cleared a massive amount of email backlog.<br><br>Check schedule - if I have anything to add to my schedule it usually starts in AF as "add x to schedule" and I can then see at a glance all of my timed appointments, or my "frantic Fridays" :-)  Tasks like "service car" do go into my AF but only until they get to my schedule.  For example my car service is due Sept/Oct - In August I will add a task "Car Service", part of which will involve calling the garage to book it in, arranging it's MOT etc.  Once it is booked in it moves to my schedule and gets picked up on the "check schedule" task.<br><br>Thinking Time - this is absolutely invaluable.  For me, one of the most amazing effects of AF has been the way it which it has identified reasons for procrastination, what I feel about certain tasks, obligations, goals, working methodology etc. I can choose to use AF just to "get things done" or I can choose to act on the things that I am coming to realise as a result of using AF and make the appropriate changes to move my life forward in a more productive and satisfying way.  Thinking Time gives me the time and space to really examine those things and plan for the future.    <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 10:07 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>It is interesting that we look at things so differently.  My understanding of "routine" is that it does not, by definition, need a reminder to do it because it is ... well, routine.  I don't need a reminder to tell me to shower in the morning, nor put on my shoes before I go out or any of those kinds of things.  They are "routine".<br><br>As to car, I don't seem to need those intermediate steps.  As soon as I look at the odometer, I know the car is ready to go in.  I know that I can schedule an appointment on the Internet so I just log on when I go back inside the house and schedule it.  I always schedule it for the same day (Saturday) because that is the only day my wife won't be needing the car and I CAN take it in (before she wakes up in the morning).  I always take it in just as they open so I'll be the first one there and can get out quickly before she wakes.  So it is all so routine that there is no need to write anything on a list just to cross it off ;-)<br><br>I get the email now (I did not before).  I used to think it was a reminder to CHECK the email, not one to NOT CHECK the email ;-)  Makes sense, in a kind of upside down way, and I like it.<br><br>I can't for the life of me get "check schedule".  I mean, I just pull out the list and the schedule first thing in the morning because ... well, because it is my routine.  I KNOW I need to do that and I do it FIRST thing in the morning with my morning coffee ... before things get away from me.  I mean, to me it seems that to take it to its logical conclusion it would be like having an AF entry to check AF ... how would you ever see it?  LOL ;-)<br><br>Likewise with "thinking time".  That is what my mornings are for.  I'm a "morning person" so my mind is at its best then and that is when I plan, think, read, research, etc.  Later on, I'm just frazzled and deep into my ADD and such that I'm lucky not to bump into things ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 10:23 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike<br><br>What is really weird is that every time I think something when reading one of your posts you then post it!   I was just thinking this morning how differently you and I look at things!<br><br>I think the key is in where you say "My understanding of "routine" is that it does not, by definition, need a reminder to do it because it is ... well, routine."  My problem is that items may be routine but I have a major resistance to them.  Yes they got done - they had to if I didn't want weeds growing in my lounge, and exotic growths in my fridge - but tasks like "stack dishwasher", "clean oven", "hoover lounge" were never tasks that I woke up in the morning thinking "oh goody - today I'm going to hoover the lounge".  Putting them on my lists has identified reasons for resistance, enabled me to do them "at the right time" and also, because they are pretty mindless tasks but I am happy about doing them, leaves my mind free to think about other things in the process. Previously my mind would have been wallowing in a cloud of resentment which was not conducive to a sunny disposition :-)  Not all of those tasks have stayed in my lists - most of them are now "just routine" - but if I start to feel any resistance then I just plonk them back into my lists .......<br><br>I like the idea of booking service appointments online - not common in the UK as far as I am aware - I get a reminder letter from my garage telling me my MOT is due which prompts me to do something about it.  Once that runs out you are liable to get stopped by the Police so it is pretty important ......!<br><br>As for Thinking Time - I am making a point of writing down my thoughts and observations in that time.  It is very different to planning time for me.  The writing down of ideas and thoughts is something I have done in the past but not kept up, for the simple reason that it is something very creative for me and usually daily pressures had squashed any creativity.  That time is allowing me to "get in touch with my creativity" again and, as you might have picked up, I enjoy looking at psychology and self development isues and that time allows me to do that.<br><br>My impression from your postings Mike is that, over the years you have established systems (your routines and planning systems) to manage any ADD tendencies and that has obviously worked very well.  My problem is that, although I had established systems and routines I was never "happy" with them - they worked but I still did not enjoy the tasks.  By effectively throwing my systems away and starting from scratch with AF I feel that I have somehow found the key to "doing" that had always been the elusive part of any system I worked with.<br><br>Hope that makes some sort of sense ...... :-)  <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 12:30 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>little b,<br>I think it was a dialogue between Christine B ( who mentioned it ) and Mark Forster, I am not sure. (Check smoke alarm batteries)<br><br>Christine B, how to you use Thinking time? Could you give me an example? You allocate a certain amount of time, or you just jot down your thoughts and them spend a time on them?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 19:03 | Silvia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alec Satin,<br><br>I should add Naikan, a most beautiful practice, although I do it often.<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.todoinstitute.org/naikan.html">http://www.todoinstitute.org/naikan.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 19:05 | Silvia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Silvia<br><br>I don't allocate a specific amount of time, just have the task Thinking Time on my list.  When it stands out l primarily use it to think through the implications of what I am learning with AF.  That may end up as planning time, if I feel a need to rethink some of my systems and procedures, or alternatively I will just "think onto paper".  I don't know if you ever read Mark's book How to Make Your Dreams Come True, which was effectively a dialogue between Mark and his future self?  I did something similar a few years ago and found it an incredibly helpful way to identify and crystallise my thought processes.  By writing down my thoughts, without any preconception of where those thoughts were going, I could really get a handle on things in a much more creative and natural way than by, I suppose, what would normally be more linear thought processes.  It made sense for me to try that technique again with AF and so far the results have been interesting and certainly enjoyable.<br><br>I'll email you an example direct as that might make more sense :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 20:25 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've added "email X" where X is someone I haven't heard from or contacted in a while.  I've also added "play with daughter for X amount of minutes" to make me take a break and give her some focused time.  Let's see, oh a great one to do every once in a while is "do nothing."  That's always a good one.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 21:31 | Jim (Atlanta)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for that Jim - just added "do nothing" to my list!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 21:47 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another routine person here.<br><br>Christine B wrote:<br><br>"My impression from your postings Mike is that, over the years you have established systems (your routines and planning systems) to manage any ADD tendencies and that has obviously worked very well.

But, for me (ADD-er also) I enjoy the structure of various routines. I enjoy knowing when I walk in the door in the evening that there are certain chores I choose to do right away so that I can then have a more relaxed evening and more aesthetic surroundings.<br><br>So, lots of things are tied into routines for me, so that I know "it is x AM/PM I am home/in my studio/ in my classroom, this is what I'll be doing for the next Y minutes."<br><br>That structure is enjoyable, even if the tasks aren't!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 22:45 | Liz I.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Liz<br><br>That's really interesting - it made me wonder whether maybe I should look at setting some sort of time block when I get in to kick start some of those tasks "off list" but I was reminded that AF made me very much aware that I have a strong dislike of "having" to do something at a specific time, and I suspect that trying to create a time block in that way would bring back resistance.  Perhaps my "problem" was as much to do with the when than the what.  I am actually finding most tasks quite enjoyable now so AF is definitely working in that regard - I just wish I didn't have such a backlog - I want to do it all and I want to do it now!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 23:27 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Liz,<br><br>Yes, that is it exactly.  I also scoop poop ... times four!  LOL ;-)  And I hate it but I know the consequences of not doing it (hell, the cats don't care, they are happy to poop somewhere else if it gets too gross for them!  ;-)  But yes, enjoyment is not part of the equation.  I fall back on the simple examples ... I get no enjoyment, nor any particular pain from putting on shoes.  I seldom even think about it.  If you stop me on my travels I'll have shoes on and probably not remember putting them on.<br><br>I have found that for something to become a routine, it has to have been managed to some extent.  Another example:  I used to HATE to get up in the morning.  Sleep and I have a very checkered past together ;-)  But at some point, and I can't remember when, I think it may have been when I got an exciting job that I had to be at by 0400 five days a week, I was able to pop right out of bed at 0300.  Snap, just like a light switch.  I've never changed away from that, even though it is no longer necessary.  It is my routine and I don't feel any resistance to it.  It is just my routine.  So whatever caused the pain has gone away so I don't need to write it down.  I hardly even hear my alarm ... I wake up 5 minutes before it is set.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 0:42 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another good task that I put on the list was to organize my outfits for 2 weeks for work - saves a lot of time in the morning deciding what to wear.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 1:25 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another good task was to put on some of the craft-oriented projects I've had kicking around for years - it's a good way to filter those things out that I thought I "should' do and those I really wanted to do.  As well as helping me to admit I didn't have the time to do all that I wanted to do and to just focus on a few things and "git 'er done".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 2:20 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think the key here is whether a task is time specific or not. If it's a routine that I clean my teeth when I get up, then that's time specific as far as I'm concerned, and it shouldn't be on the list. I think that's pretty obvious!<br><br>However having a deadline is not the same as being time specific. My experience is that Autofocus is better at delivering things by their deadline dates, than I am unaided. So I would most certainly include deadline tasks on AF.<br><br>And the fact that something is recurring, doesn't make it routine. So things like Email, Forum Comments, studying, Twitter, Facebook, tidying the office, are all tasks on AF. And have benefited immensely from being there.<br><br>On the other hand I don't have "Read Newspaper" as an AF task because that is part of my routine over breakfast.<br><br>And as for "Back Up Hard Drive" - I've mechanised that so it happens automatically every day. I do have a task to check that it's happened correctly though!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 16:10 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Having been caught with a dud phone one too many times, "charge mobile".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2009 at 9:04 | Alison</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
