But I also use it as a place for Most Important Things (MITs) inspired by ZTD, as discussed before here:  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/679222">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/679222</a><br><br>I find that putting them in the closed list/backlog helps me finish large, important projects. Basically, I use this as a placeholder for urgent tasks that I would like to focus on that week. <br><br>The "Active Pages" is the where all the todo's would go. This is the "page" used by paper-based AF setups. <br><br>As you can also see, I have three Areas of Responsibilities "Repeating", "Waiting On", and "Dismissed." I reason I use Areas for the last two instead of tags is because it allows me to keep things separated. I fear missing something because some items having the same tag could be near the bottom while others would be on the top. For instance:<br><br>Buy Bony M CD [errands] [waiting on]<br>Clean guestroom [home] [waiting on]<br>Back up second computer [home] [repeating]<br>Organize magazines [home] <br>Post setup on Mark Forster's forum [computer]<br>Clean software box in bedroom [home]<br>Week 1 of Algebra 1 practice [home]<br>Shovel driveway [waiting on]<br><br>Although the above is a short list, I still see how I could procrastinate and miss something. This mess of tags and contexts is one of the reasons why I decided to leave GTD for AF in the first place.<br><br>For repeating items, Things has a limitation that prevents items from being repeated in a Project. So, I cannot put, say, "Renew pool membership" inside my "Active Pages" Project. Instead, I have to use the Repeating Area. Although this may seem like a limitation at first, I actually like how recurring events do not clutter my Projects' screen.<br><br><br>Some basic questions answered:<br><br><br>Question 1: Why use electronic methods instead of paper-and-pen, like Mark Forster recommends?<br><br>While I liked using a notebook (I used a small moleskin previously) for AF, I found that it often got pretty messy when I used it. It was also difficult to keep track of recurring events as it would clutter up the pages. Also, when I went out I had to carry another notebook with me to write things on (like a grocery list), so I had to keep switching them back and forth. <br><br>But more importantly, although I loved the workflow of AF, my moleskine did not *feel* like a safe system that I could rely on. Now I only use my notebook for notes and brainstorming. <br><br><br>Question 2: Why use Things for AF instead of similar software like The Hit List or Omnifocus?<br><br>Firstly, although Things is not really recommended for a GTD-like implementation, I feel it is the best for something like AF. Its limitations actually become benefits when using it with AF.<br><br>In the beginning, I used Omnifocus to try to implement AF, as I had great success with the program with GTD. However, I felt the program was too complex and clunky for me and seemed to ignore the whole feeling of "free-flowing" productivity that AF allowed with a notebook. <br><br>I then tried to use The Hit List, because someone else used it with AF (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/740814#post749820).">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/740814#post749820).</a> I tried to use it, but I found that I was tweaking it more than actually using it. <br><br>Finally, I decided to use Things (which I unsuccessfully tried before for GTD). Immediately, I found the interface an actual pleasure to work with, and its simplicity allowed the right mix of AF's workflow and some structure to keep things from falling apart.<br><br>Question 3: Why not use multiple Projects like "Page 1,"  "Page 2," "Page 3" instead of<br>one large "Active Pages"?<br><br>Although using multiple pages makes sense when using AF with paper-and-pen, it is not entirely necessary with electronic methods. Since Things is able to hold large amounts of items in a Project, I really had no need to divide them up into multiple Projects.<br><br>Personally, I like how everything is in one place in this setup, as I am able to preview the whole list without having doubts of missing something that might be on another page. Of course, this might change over time, but at this moment I do not see the need.<br><br><br><br>I'd really like to thank Mark for creating this system; I finally, after many months of using GTD, have found the "holy grail" that I was looking for. By using Things, I also feel that I eliminated the feeling of something 'missing' with AF on long-term goals, compared to DIT or GTD. It works like a complete system for me now.  :-)<br><br>P.S. I apologize if my list of todo's are small; I actually had a lots of things to do, but I took the screenshot after completing most of them. (See?! That proves that AF works!) :-P<br><br>P.P.S If anyone has any questions regarding my setup, feel free to ask!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 December 2009 at 23:56 | Musaab</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Musaab for posting this - it looks good.<br><br>What is the 'someday' section and how do you deal with these? Do you regularly review that section and move some items onto the active list on a regular basis?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2009 at 5:13 | Nick</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The 'Someday' section is for ideas or things you might want to do in the future. Basically, it acts as a placeholder for ideas you are interested in but cannot do immediately. For instance, "Build outdoor swimming pool" is an idea you want to pursue in the future, but not right now since the weather might be too cold or you might have other priorities.<br><br>I review this section weekly, and I drag-and-drop items in my active list if I want to start working on them.  <br><br>I used to write my ideas on index cards a while back, but I often misplaced them and forgot about them altogether. :-P<br><br>To clarify the other sections:<br><br>'Inbox': This section follows GTD's philosophy of 'capturing everything in one place'. But since using AF, it has become redundant, as I now add items directly to my "Pages" Project. So, I use this section as a placeholder for incomplete items, commitments, or goals. This is essentially the "Think More About" section.   <br><br>'Today': This section acts only as a reminder for due items (like "Return library books"). Any event scheduled for today is added automatically to the 'Today' section. This prevents me from missing a deadline.<br><br>'Next': This view shows all "Pages" at one glance; I use this to review my active lists.<br><br>'Scheduled': Items with a hard deadline get moved here. I then create my calendar by reviewing this section every week. <br><br>'People': This section is for delegating work to someone else.<br><br><br><br>So all in all, this setup is working very well for me. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2009 at 11:13 | Musaab</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
