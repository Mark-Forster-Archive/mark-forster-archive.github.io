I've taken all my open tasks and put them in Outlook with a Due Date of March 2 (1 month from today).<br><br>2. I've setup a Tasks view to Group based on Due Date, Sort based on Creation time.  I added an Automatic Formatting rule to underline any tasks whose "Due Date" is "on or before" "today".  Once I get the hang of it I will probably update the view to filter out tasks that were due before today (i.e. dead, gone, buried).<br><br>So I see my tasks grouped by Date (right now, all I see is 85 tasks on March 2).  As I go round that list and work them, I will modify them by resetting the due date to 1 week from now (Feb 9).  Then I will have 2 lists that I collapse and expand to simulate turning of pages.<br><br>A nice feature of Outlook is that I can just type over the existing Due Date with the phrase "1 week" and Outlook will automatically set the due date for 1 week later.  Same for "1 month".<br><br>I also use a colored Categories to denote GTD contexts, but that's just my own personal preference.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 16:14 | Brian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Actually I found this new DIT/AF system to be very compatible with mobile time management/calendar software such as Pocket Informant for Blackberry OS (which is what I use).  The nitty gritty of my current setup is below, but in brief, what happens is<br><br>1) Every new task is automatically due 30 days (or, as I use it, 28 days) from the time I enter the said task<br><br>2) The tasks are listed chronologically: the tasks due nearer today are above the others.<br><br>3) (Now this is what I found really interesting) I can with two presses of a button set the due date of a task today so that I can highlight what I need to do; then with another few presses of a button, make its new due date one week from now. <br><br>4) Surprisingly, new tasks without any due or starting date are automatically relegated to the bottom of the heap;  I therefore have a default way of listing "waiting for / something pending" tasks.<br><br>5) For my own edit of this new system, I can also with a few presses of a button to change the due date of a task /Tomorrow/, and change its priority.  I can therefore set up what I think would be the most important thing to do tomorrow (reminiscent of the "Current Initiative" idea in the original DIT).<br><br><br>Mark, it seems you made this new system exactly for me and my phone.  I thank you very heartily ^_____________^<br><br><br>So here are the details of my settings:<br><br>1) In Options --&gt; Tasks<br>    a) setup &lt;New Task Default Dates&gt;  to "Start (Days from Today): 0" (This is so that the tasks show up in the "Today" view)<br>    b) setup &lt;New Task Default Dates&gt;  to "End (Days from Start): 30"  (NOTE: I use 28 for this value so that the start and end days fall on the same day of the week)<br>    c) setup &lt;Sort Order&gt; to "Date, Priority, Subject"<br>    d) check the &lt;Ascending Date sort&gt; box<br><br>2) New tasks are now automatically set as due 30 days (or in my case 28 days) from now<br><br>3) Upon doing a task, use "Menu -&gt; Make due date today."  This sets the task to the very top of the list, thus highlighting it.<br><br>4) When this task is recurrent/to be re-entered, use "Menu -&gt; Move Task -&gt; + Week" to  move its new due date a week from now.<br><br>5) When entering a task that has a prerequisite event to happen first, remove the checks from the "Start Date" and "End Date" boxes. <br><br>^__________^</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 18:29 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh, here is where you can find Pocket Informant for Blackberry OS:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pocketinformant.com/products_info.php?p_id=pocketinformant_bb">http://www.pocketinformant.com/products_info.php?p_id=pocketinformant_bb</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 18:32 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Mark, it seems you made this new system exactly for me and my phone.

You do know that OF supports syncing of perspectives nowadays? This is what made my own GTD+AF4-ish implementation finally work. I just use one perspective in which all the task are sorted by 'Changed', meaning that I have the tasks in the order they are entered (or re-entered if I have worked on them).

Unfortunately OF doesn't support reverse sorting as far I know. But I personally don't mind whether the newest ones are on top or bottom as long as they are consistently so on both Mac and iPhone. The main point is that with perspectives you can sort by any OF criterion: Added, Changed, Start, Due etc. so they should work very well with AF and DWM.

What I also like about Omnifocus is that you can set a "Start Date"  for when you want tasks to appear. I use this to hide a lot of repetitive/routine tasks because I can't see the point in letting them clutter up the list; to me, that's a big advantage compared to working DWM on paper.<br><br>I tried setting up DWM in Appigo Todo, but without the "start date" feature, routine tasks just cluttered things up.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2010 at 17:42 | Trevor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am not a paperphobe and so I use paper as my primary DWM notebook.  I do like to have a copy in electronic form on the iPhone so I can do various sorts.  I have played with various apps and the one I found most flexible is Toodledo.  (Thanks Mel ;-)  Here is how I use it, in case anyone is interested.<br><br>1) I set the default date for new tasks to be one month.  When I complete a task I mark it done with one click.  If it is not complete, I change the "Due Date" to "Next Week" with a two clicks.<br><br>2) There is a bulk entry ability and I used that to enter everything in my book into the program.<br><br>3) Once I had the tasks in the program, I set up some "Folders".  "Folders" mean "Projects" so me.  So while I may have a bunch of tasks scattered over the list about fixing the computers, I put them all in a "Computers" folder and I can look at just those when I am doing that project.<br><br>4) For those of you who like "Contexts", it has those as well.<br><br>5) You can also "Tag" tasks anyway you like.  There is no practical limit to the number of tags you can use on a task.<br><br>6) I found that I can put "Events" and tasks with strict deadlines into the list simply by setting a "Start Date" to the same date as the "Due Date".  They then won't appear until that date.  (Unless you want them to.)<br><br>7) You can attach notes to tasks which allows putting Projects in as tasks with specific steps as notes.  This can eliminate lots of clutter from the list.<br><br>8) Pocket Informant will sync with Toodledo, but I don't like that it does not give me access to Folders.<br><br>9) There is an iPhone app you can get but I have so far opted not to do that because ...<br><br>10) I can access my list via the Safari browser from the iPhone and it is excellent.  If I'm out of cell phone signal access, I can always fall back on PI which I still keep synced.  But that almost never happens.<br><br>11) There is an add-in for Firefox (and most other browsers).  It looks exactly like the iPhone web access screen.  Very nice if you are working on the computer most of the day.<br><br>12) I have not explored the gazillion other ways to access it (Twiter, eMail, etc.)<br><br>13) You can import and export in CSV and Text formats.  There is a one button export to Excel, for example, if you want to keep other kinds of information, such as statistics.<br><br>14) You can share tasks with others in a number of ways.<br><br>15) It has the ability to print one of those Origami pocket books.  You know, where you cut and fold it up to make a letter size sheet to be the size of a postage stamp?  ;-)<br><br>There are other features such as priority and such.  It even calculates an "Importance" number which uses a formula considering priority, number of days until due, etc.<br><br>All in all, the combination of Toodledo and the iPhone is almost perfect.  Of course, I STILL enter my information into my paper book FIRST.  It is still faster to do it that way.  At least for me.  And I am completely sure that my paper won't suddenly start costing me big bucks because the business model was not proving profitable ;-)<br><br>Oh, and it is FREE!

Sounds like DWM + Toodledo is a good combo. <br><br>I'd really like to find a way to do DWM in Outlook, since that's where all my work "lives".  I especially like the ability in Microsoft OneNote 2007 to flag a sentence as a task, and then it shows up automatically in Outlook.   Currently the Outlook tasks serve as ticklers which then get copied to my DWM notebook.   I like the idea of eventually moving everything over to Outlook...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2010 at 20:49 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am a inveterate fiddler, and so I've been trying AF and DWM both on paper and electronically, using Palm Tasks, LIfe Balance, OmniFocus, Toodledo, Bonsai, and one more that I want to share with you:: Google Tasks. If you have Gmail or any Google Account, you can use the Tasks feature to list the tasks, and you can see the list separately at:<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas">http://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas</a><br><br>Anyway, if you click on Sort by Due Date, you get a very nice DWM style list with each date as a separate heading, similar to a paper page (but without the blank pages). It looks good and is easy to use with the due date aspect of DWM.  What I like most is being able to create a task that is linked to an email in Gmail, and then that task is grouped with the others.<br><br>As for paper, I used a nice Moleskine for AF1-4, but for DWM I just bought a composition book with 100 ruled sheets. I then dated them manually starting with Feb. 16, and use paper clips to mark the two entry pages.  I did this because of Mark's recommendation of paper, but I may eventually settle with electronic.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2010 at 0:06 | Gorham</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For now (!), I'm using OmniFocus. One tip is that the iPhone interface adds one feature that I like that's missing from the main app. Like Google Tasks, mentioned above, the OF on the iPhone, will show the task list divided into Day sections. The desktop app, lumps them all together, although there's a date column that you can scrutinize.<br><br>The visual seperation of days on the iPhone makes for a nice, easy DWM list.<br><br>(Related, OmniFocus can sync with iCal, which you can then view by day, thus seeing just that day's tasks...)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2010 at 3:19 | ds</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just tried out www.gqueues.com. It's free and integrates with Google well. You can create a smart list of tasks that are 4 weeks out or less, but apparently not exactly 1 month. You also do not have a default option of making tasks due a month from now, BUT it is very easy to do this just as it is in Google tasks by writing Check out GQueues 3/13. There is an iPhone app of course. ;-) It allows you to make any email or website into a task as well. It might be a little buggy, but for you fiddlers it could be fun. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2010 at 6:59 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is excellent Mel.

It seems that the solution that some people are using is to use a todo list with due dates attached tasks. I understand why, but this somehow seems wrong to me. Let's suppose I have a task like "Pick up present for party on Friday". That is a task with a *real* due date. What DWM tasks have, it seems to me, are "expiration dates" not "due dates". Do any of the electronic tools allow attaching "extra" dates to tasks?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2010 at 16:34 | Tony</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;What DWM tasks have, it seems to me, are "expiration dates" not "due dates". Do any of the electronic tools allow attaching "extra" dates to tasks? <br><br>I put the due date as part of the description (Excel) even though I could use as many columns/dates as I wanted/needed. I've been thinking of using my Palm Tungsten's task list for my home DWM and that's only got one date (two if you include the completed date)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2010 at 16:54 | Lillian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find no problem using the "Due Date" as the "Expiration Date".  I am not confused by it.  When I look at the name of the task I know if it is a hard date or a DWM expiration date.  It is much like using the paper system and putting both the DWM task on the expiration date and hard "Due Date" tasks on that same page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2010 at 18:38 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Tony, Toodledo allows you to put "Due by," "Due on," "Due after," or "Optionally on."

The best I've come up with so far is to make the start and due dates the same to keep the hard date task from showing up early.  Clearly I have much more to learn.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2010 at 19:40 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>So, I am using FocusPad for my todo list. It does not currently support DWM, but I have been pondering if I could use it anyway. Here is my idea:<br><br>* Turn on the option to show the creation date.<br><br>* New tasks and re-entered tasks automatically get added to the end of the list. I would color the re-entered tasks blue. New tasks would remain black.<br><br>* Each day I would go into the list and delete (or gray out) any black todos that have been created 30 days before today. Similarly I would delete or gray out any blue todos that have been created 7 days or more before today.<br><br>* To find a task to do, I scan the list from beginning to end.<br><br>This seems like it would work, but I have not used DWM yet, so I might be missing something.

The task must be completed *by* this date. "Due on" simply means that the tasks is like an appointment. It is due *on* that date. The "Optionally On" means that the task will be removed from the list if not done by the date and if it is recurring it will be moved forward.
