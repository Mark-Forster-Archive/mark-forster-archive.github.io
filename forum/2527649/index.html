Productivity is defined by what you have done."<br><br>Discuss</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 July 2015 at 19:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In the context of these two terms I think that productivity is defined as moving your committments - to others and to yourself - forwards towards their many goals.  Busyness is a function of your activity and time used.  Becoming more productive is defined as using your busyness to support your productivity and being aware of, and managing, that busyness which will not.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2015 at 12:52 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think of "busyness" as the entire set of activities on which I expend time and effort - productively, restoratively, or wastefully.<br><br>There is a lot of overlap and gray area between those categories, but I think of "productivity" as the outcome/results of the productive activities. Those are the activities that accomplish, or bring me closer to accomplishing, the things that matter to me, from the most mundane tasks (eating, washing, spending time with loved ones) to the loftiest goals (world domination, etc.).<br><br>It's helpful to distinguish between the mundane tasks and the lofty goals, but my instinct is to classify both as "productive" because if you neglect the mundane for too long, you can kiss your bigger goals goodbye. For example, you might be able to hire someone to wash your dishes and cut the grass so that you can spend more time inventing a perpetual motion machine; but you still need to manage that person. And you can't hire someone to do your eating and sleeping for you. (I've tried! It doesn't work!)<br><br>Besides: If I spend an entire day catching up on mundane but necessary overdue tasks, without getting any closer to my bigger goals, I have at least prevented myself from slipping farther away from my goals. Sometimes, that is an accomplishment in itself!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2015 at 18:57 | JulieBulie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>... so I think that means I agree with Mark's statement, more or less, regarding "productivity." But I'm not sure how to connect "busyness" to what I haven't done; I don't understand that statement. Does it refer to the things that don't get done when we waste time spinning our wheels?<br><br>Chris's definition of "busyness" is a lot like mine, but much more concise. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2015 at 19:04 | JulieBulie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>JulieBulie:<br><br>&lt;&lt; But I'm not sure how to connect "busyness" to what I haven't done; I don't understand that statement. &gt;&gt;<br><br>My experience as a time management coach was that when people said they were "too busy" they would then point to a huge list of things which they hadn't yet done. And frequently they wanted my help not just to get it all done, but also to get even more things done (i.e. "all the things I'd like to do but I'm just too busy").<br><br>My aim was to convince them that the way to become more productive was to cut down on all the busy work so that eventually they could point to a record of achieving things that really mattered to them (without my prejudging what those things should be).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2015 at 19:28 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>" If work and leisure are soon to be subordinated to this one utopian principle - absolute busyness - then utopia and melancholy will come to coincide: an age without conflict will dawn, perpetually busy - and without consciousness."<br>Gunter Grass</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 July 2017 at 18:38 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Busyness is defined by activity, productivity is defined by effectiveness.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 July 2017 at 19:49 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark's original definition is perfect.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 July 2017 at 17:57 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another take on the definition: -<br><br>Busyness is not being particularly aware of what tasks you are doing.<br>Productivity is being more aware of what tasks you are doing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2017 at 10:45 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Busyness is defined by what you haven't done.

"Do nothing" can be hard to put on a "might-do" list; I often feel guilty about doing nothing. But busyness can be a pain - to myself and to others.  I'm still experimenting with ways of getting doing to be balanced between idleness and busyness so that "being" comes out just right and quantity balances quality. Reducing a sense of obligation is one way to be open to reconciling leisure with busyness, idleness, and urgency. Perhaps it's another way to reach flow state.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 November 2017 at 23:21 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>michael:<br><br>Maybe DIT is the right system for you at the moment? It features this moment in the day, when you finished the closed list and therefore can now "play".
