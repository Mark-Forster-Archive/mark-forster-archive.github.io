In the background there'd be fireworks and lots of people milling about eating smores.  Then someone could do a video presentation of Mark working through his Superfocus 3 system!<br><br>In all seriousness, it sounds like his testing is going quite well.  <br><br>I do have a theoretical question for Mark though, that I've thought about over the last few days.  When you're testing these systems, is it possible that the motivation or drive you get to get through tasks comes from the testing itself and not from a desire to do the task?  Not sure I'm explaining it right.  That may explain why your systems work for some but not for others.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2011 at 19:17 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>TK:<br><br>That's a good question, but I've tested more than enough systems already - some have been successful, others have collapsed within a few days (and I haven't even written about them). So if it's the testing that drives the system, it's remarkably inconsistent!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2011 at 22:37 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Mark!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 5:24 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Are there some forecasts about SAF v.3 instructions publication?

I do, however, want to remark on Mark's testing.  TK's question indeed was a good one as one always has to be concerned about bias creeping into any study design.  As a professor and scientist, I am all too aware of this issue.  Observing the comprehensiveness of Mark's testing of systems over the years, and with his long experience with time management approaches, I am confident that his testing is done without bias causing a confounding variable leading to a successful outcome.  It is hard to bridle one's enthusiasm for something novel and not let that behavior influence the outcome.  But I do not see this occurring with Mark in his testing.<br><br>At least that is my view.  <br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 14:36 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Come on David, don't apologize, I think we're all excited about this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 16:31 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Navigare:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Are there some forecasts about SAF v.3 instructions publication? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, as Alan correctly says, when I finish War and Peace.<br><br>If I keep up my present pace, that will be on February 18th.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 18:27 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thank you for your replies Alan and Mark!<br><br>Then I should not postpone my cleaning in SAF tasks :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 18:29 | Navigare</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There is something strange i can't understand. May be it is a psychological aspect. <br>I am a bit reluctant to SAF. I noticed I feel much better with AF4 or AF4R. I dont know why. It seem the second column blocks me somewhere. May be its the rules or the formal aspect. I noticed to that when something is too much organized like GTD  or a group of relative tasks I feel indeed reluctant to do things. I feel much better with non organized system. I may say i feel much better with messy systems like AF1 or AF4... Why ? Do you feel the same ?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 18:35 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The trouble with the published SAF is (to quote Mark) "It can become rather directionless with a lack of proper balance between the two columns on the page."<br><br>I'm not sure what the "proper balance" is, but you (and I) can easily get stuck trying to decide what's next.<br><br>I think the problem with GTD is the complexity of organizing distracts, AND the actual organization somehow doesn't fit the way the mind works.  I think the problem is a clash between what you think you should do, and what you feel ready to do.  When these two are different, doing the former builds stress.  Doing the latter doesn't.  AF makes the choice easier.<br><br>Bill Jensen, author of Simplicity (Making Work Work), follows this theme in a slightly different context, that of the modern office.  He proposes that every delegation of work should include, rather than a detailed spec of the work, these three elements:<br>Know - what the receiver needs to understand<br>Feel - information affecting how the worker should feel about the work<br>Do - what this person should make happen.<br><br>The point is that a modern knowledge worker can be much more effective when the mind and heart are in tune with work expectation, so communicate this way.  This level of understanding also empowers the employee to deal with the inevitable obstacles that arise.<br><br>For you as a user of a TM system (like AutoFocus), whether you are assigned the work or define it yourself, you control when and how it gets done.  This work is best accomplished when your heart and mind are in tune.  AF presents a mix of tasks so you can pick one that fits.  When GTD processes the tasks, often only your mind is geared for action.  AF4R's division of labour presents the same potential flaw if you get yourself stuck in the Unfinished page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 19:18 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very interesting Alan. I would be very interested to meet you in Paris if one day you come to. We may have passionate conversation about AF !. <br><br>I submit an idea to Mark too, as you are in retirement make a club in Paris were we could meet once a time (monthly-twice a year) and discuss about AF !  <br><br>Anyway Alan, I am right with you Gtd is too complex. But they are some good ideas. <br>AF is more efficient with me because of it's ability to let my intuition, my heart and my rational brain. I noticed my minds likes simplicity. He hates complex systems. He is oriented to action and immediate results.e goes straight to the point, decides and then act. <br><br>Once again I 100% agree with you : "So likewise the work is best accomplished when your heart and mind are in tune." and "AF presents a mix of tasks so you can pick one that fits."<br>So i feel much better with a single list or maximum 2 lists and do things. With systems like SAF or GTD I am simply stuck because i dont know what to choose and when. <br><br>Instead of AF1-2 or AF4  or AF4R (but I prefer a AF1 list treated as a long list (not page per page) wich let me do things easily. I noticed than in the rush i simply pass over each item until one stand at me and if it belongs to a project i just read a secont time the list to find all the relative item and lok at my project file to see my comments about it. <br><br>As Nuntym said somewhere more things are complicated less they work. <br><br>I dont know what make MF so enthusiastic about his new system and i dont know if it will suits to me but what am am sure is that some systems are perfects for some and are a disaster for others. DWM was a wash out for me. It never worked. AF1, AF4, AF4R worked well with me because it let me free and did not sequestered me in a closed organised system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 19:58 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter,<br><br>I found GTD complicated, many others love it, it is obviously very popular.  With regards to Mark, he may have found the perfect system for him however, it may not fit others.  The reality is he has invented and moved on from many systems that other find very useful.  I am glad the TT concept came out before he found the new system or else I may be without something that fits me like a glove.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 21:29 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re GTD, I honestly believe it's popular because David Allen clearly and eloquently identified the problem so many people are wrestling with.  It resonated.  The proposed solution is logical, but only mediocre in effectiveness.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 21:36 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re GTD<br>Honestly, I don't see GTD and AF as competing models. To me, they address different concerns completely. GTD is excellent at helping you define the tasks that need to be done (or *can* be done) but doesn't really address the actual execution of those tasks. AF and its derivatives manage the *doing* without paying much attention to filtering the tasks from the clutter of information that come our way.<br><br>Looking at GTD from that perspective will-- at least for me-- boil the process down to a couple of questions:<br>1. Is this "something to know" or "something to do"?<br>2. If it's "something to do", what can I do *right now*?<br>The answers to that second question go on my AF list to be processed accordingly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2011 at 23:42 | jFenter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have a slightly different perspective - I think Mark's systems are more likely to appeal to people who have to 'see' everything. I have a tendancy to ignore anything that isn't in front of me - I am a 'visual' worker. Therefore GTD just hides most of my lists. I am not that good at weekly reviews etc either so that compounds the problem. With Mark's AF and SAF systems particularly you are confident everything is in one place - you may focus in on one page at a time, but you know you are getting to the others and they won't just get forgotten.<br><br>I do believe that the more complex you make a time management system, then the harder it is to maintain and the chances are you spend time maintaining your system, that you could otherwise use in getting your tasks done.<br><br>I too am awaiting the new system with baited breath. 18 days seems a long time to wait - however I'm sure it is important that the system is tested thoroughly for any possible quirks. I also appreciate the fact that Mark gives his ideas to us freely, and keeps us abreast with his developments.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2011 at 9:02 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yeah....18 days IS a long time to wait....sigh...<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2011 at 16:14 | David Drake</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
