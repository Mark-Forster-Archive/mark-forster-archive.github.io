Add tasks to this list. Put a tick when done to the right.<br>Keep adding ticks as and when done. When no more room. Cross it out, add at the bottom and carry on as before.<br>This is a bit like Mark's plate spinning method.<br><br>2.Another page to add new tasks as and when they come in. Scan regularly and cross off when done. AKA simple scanning.<br><br>3.Finally a few pages later on in your note pad for deferred tasks headed "Mar 18", "Apr 18", "May 18" etc, where you can write tasks in there and then review/action at the right time.<br><br>Seems simple enough and very effective. Hope that helps.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2018 at 12:38 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh yes, and one quick add on: -<br><br>I have a simple priority system - you could split the tasks on a page into 2 columns. One for urgent and the other for not so urgent. Do them roughly in the ratio of 2:1. Oldest first.<br><br>That keeps everything jogging along and the more urgent done first and the oldest not so urgent still being worked on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2018 at 13:09 | MrBacklog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is probably over-obvious, but put stuff a month away on a digital calendar, print out the calendar, and then keep the paper in your back pocket.

It's basically an email reminder system. So for an item I have to do on the first Friday of every month, I create an email with the subject CHECK GREDUNZA and in the to: line, I write "every1stFriday@fut.io" and then I will get that email every first Friday. The scheduling is very flexible. If I can't do the task that day, it's easy to push the reminder back a day, a week, etc.<br><br>What I like about email reminders is 1) quick and easy 2) not on the calendar but I get the reminders when I need them and 3) presumably I know how to keep a clean inbox, so they don't pile up.<br><br>Let the systems remember the tasks for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2018 at 13:12 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think I'd use DIT if I were in your situation. DIT handles future tasks pretty well -- just enter them onto the dated page when you first want to see them. I've used the softcover version of these Moleskine pocket-sized daily journal notebooks for DIT, they work really well: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://us.moleskine.com/12-month-daily-planner-scarlet/p0268#">http://us.moleskine.com/12-month-daily-planner-scarlet/p0268#</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2018 at 14:43 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That sounds like me. Former Professional Engineer, quit work 20 years ago when the kids arrived. Several commitments for guilds.<br><br>Move the vacation property stuff to a different list. Maybe add "buy what's needed" to the calendar two weeks before the trip.<br><br>Did you do your housework that often before? That frequency sounds like make-work to me.<br><br>Lots of good suggestions here for recurring tasks. I usually use a single page for the next year, then, when that page gets full, recopy it to one page per quarter,, repeat as makes sense. That keeps the book thinner for very little recopying time.<br><br>I also record the date last done, especially for things with fuzzy repeat times. I want to do something every 4-8 weeks. Last time I did it, I wrote the next time on Jan 1. Does that mean Jan 1 is 4 weeks, and it can slide a bit, or 8 weeks and I absolutely must do it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 February 2018 at 20:47 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Lots of great suggestions.

Then I need to block out some time every day on my daily todo list for some of those housework items.<br><br>Mike, I do put some future tasks into my iphone calendar.  Every week I print out a pocketmod with daily pages and add the future tasks that will come due in the current week.  I carry the pocketmod in my back pocket.<br><br>Cricket, I sometimes feel that our housework list is overkill, but my wife and I babysit grandkids a lot - they really trash the house. Two autofocus lists might just work - one for home and one for when we are at our vacation property.  And yes, it is useful to buy maintenance items and project supplies in advance at home rather than at the vacation property.<br><br>Now I have to figure out how to integrate these ideas into a system that I can trust to keep track of my tasks and present them to me at the proper time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 February 2018 at 0:38 | Rusty</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There's a good summary of DIT here, including an except of Mark's DIT "quick start":<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://entirelyuseless.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/do-it-tomorrow/">http://entirelyuseless.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/do-it-tomorrow/</a><br><br>There is a more detailed summary here:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/review-do-it-tomorrow/">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/review-do-it-tomorrow/</a><br><br>And of course, there's lots more material on DIT on this site. :-)<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/do-it-tomorrow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/do-it-tomorrow</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 February 2018 at 16:11 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Rusty - I'm also retired.  :-) <br><br>I use an app that you might like called "Clean my house" that schedules all the house maintenance / cleaning tasks I do.  I give it about 15 minutes in the morning and evening and finish off what's backlogged on the weekends, if anything.  I think I've set up about 70 total tasks in there. Just too much for an AF list or a calendar (IMO). <br><br>Otherwise, I use a weekly calendar called Action Day (bought it on Amazon) which has room for projects and a misc task list which is the right size for me for a week (about 30 lines). I also don't have many appointments and I have those in Google calendar anyway. I use the time boxes to record what I'm going to focus on every hour or block of hours (sort of like The Next Hour or Frank's Oasis method) which also acts as a "Done" list because some days time goes by so fast and I didn't have a clue what I did all day. That calendar wouldn't fit in your pocket though and maybe it's overkill for what you want.<br><br>If I were you, I'd set up a mini bullet journal.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2018 at 22:49 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The mini bullet journal is new to me.  I don't quite get it yet, but will study it a bit more.  Meanwhile...<br><br>I’m contemplating a system with four moving parts:<br>1. Housekeeping/maintenance/yardwork list on paper (lots of small repetitive tasks)<br>2. Autofocus notebook for one-off projects around home<br>3. Autofocus notebook for one-off projects around the vacation property<br>4. A list of tasks and appointments (partially pre-printed) in pocketmod format that must be done on specific days of the week<br><br>Item 1. includes weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual tasks.  The high-volume weekly housecleaning tasks are too numerous to add to the autofocus notebook every day so I will block out an hour a day on the five weekdays to get through the weekly items on the list.  These one hour blocks are pre-printed on the appropriate days on the pocketmod daily schedule 4. above.<br><br>The monthly, quarterly and annual tasks have been assigned to particular months on list 1., and I will add these to the autofocus notebook on a month-to-month basis. I use the autofocus method in its traditional format with pretty good success.<br><br>On a daily basis I will give priority to the daily must-do items on the pocketmod (4.)  For the rest of the day I will work the autofocus notebook.<br><br>This has more moving parts than I like, but I’ve tried lots of different approaches without consistent success.  May as well give this a go. I'll report in a week or so how this is going (mostly for my benefit to keep me motivated).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2018 at 3:57 | Rusty</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A bullet journal would work well for your situation.

The fancy coloured pages tend to get more attention, but many use less. (Some people get side-tracked by making pretty pages, but for many, the time spent designing and colouring is calming and keeps the book interesting.)<br><br>Most people change the way they do things fairly often. Number of pages per week, how far ahead to plan in how much detail. Which things get their own page.<br><br>It also includes a few ways to connect pages, since you can't just open the rings and move the page, and how to index things so you can find them again. Much trial and error, and flexibility.<br><br>+++<br><br>What happens when you don't follow the schedule? I find that question makes a huge difference.<br><br>+++<br><br>I do something similar with housework. My goal is 30-60 minutes a day. I fill it with urgent things first, then less urgent. Slow repeats are always on a list, since they're easy to put off. Fast repeats vary with what works at the tme. Sometimes I like the certainty and reward of planning and crossing off, even if it's the same list every day. Other times, trusting myself to know what needs doing works better.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2018 at 17:16 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Rusty:<br><br>I don't know why, but for some reason this thread has managed to escape my notice.

I marked them clearly with the start date. If they got annoying, or prevented closing a page, I dedicated the next blank page in my list (or part of it) to future tasks, and moved the tasks to there. Sometimes I roughly grouped them by start date ((takes longer to do, and is easier to cross out a batch when done), or added calendar pages to my AF book (more work than it saved), or added a dot if due this week and another dot if due in 48 hours (easy, and a bit messier), or moved tasks due in the next bit back to the active list (more rewriting). All the methods worked well enough (except for adding calendar pages), and there was no clear winner.<br><br>Most of the time, I found that worked better than putting them on my calendar, at least for tasks likely to be done in the next month or three. I could plan a complicated project without flipping through calendar pages (or screens). My calendar didn't get cluttered with tasks. I could write things in the book in front of me rather than finding my phone or going to my computer (which has all sorts of shiny things on it).<br><br>Occasionally, I'd dedicate a page to a future project, like Take to cottage. Again, the book was in front of me, and the list wouldn't get lost. (Downside to bound notebooks: Moving the page. I usually cut it out and glued it into the new book, or recopied and tidied it.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2018 at 21:30 | Cricket</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
