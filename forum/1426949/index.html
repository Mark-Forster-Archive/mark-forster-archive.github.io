Thus every time I meet such task I make "hmmmm" and go to the next one.<br><br>This leads to frequently rereading of tasks, which will be annihilated by dismissal in the end.<br><br>And everytime I meet such tasks there's little time and little thinking invested.<br><br>Isn't this a waste of time and energy? Or is there some misunderstanding (again ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2011 at 16:20 | jens</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think what happens is the more times you see the same thing, eventually you might decide to take some action on it. Sometimes you have let things marinate. Even if you dismiss it, it's still going to be seen when you review dismissals. If you finally delete it, at least you know you thought about it rather than just forgot.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2011 at 17:36 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Hi jens!<br><br>If I understand what you posted, you meet tasks in your SF which grab your attention, which make you say, "hmmm...." but you judge you cannot do right now because of time, energy, or situational constraints, and thus you skip them again and again until you dismiss them, right?<br><br>Hahaha, welcome to the club ;)<br><br>Talking from my experiences, those "hmmm" moments are actually the "standing out" of tasks that is so important in Mark's system.  Therefore, to skip those tasks without doing anything will actually harm your SF/AF system in the long run, because you are ignoring your instincts, and doing that repeatedly will eventually lead to you unconsciously not trusting the system.  <br><br>I am now actually convinced that my own willful ignorance of those "hmmm" moments is the greatest factor in my problems with following ANY of Mark's systems over that past years.<br><br>Therefore, when we meet "hmmm" tasks in SF, those tasks that somehow stand out but we cannot do now or in the near feature, I suggest that we /somehow/ act on these tasks ASAP.  So how do I do this, in my own SF?<br><br>1) NEVER IGNORE THE "HMMM" TASKS! This is most important.  To let those "hmmm" lie fallow in your SF list will not only make you unconsciously not trust your SF/AF list, but will also mess up your processing of the list since it will continually call for your attention.<br><br>2) If you do not have the time or energy to even consider it now, cross out the "hmm" task ("hmmm" tasks are invariably found in Column 1) and write it in the Column 2 of the next page.  If you want, place a mark beside it (in my case, I put an asterisk, *) to let you know it is a task under consideration.  However, it is best to consider "hmmm" tasks ASAP.<br><br>3) When you find the time or energy to consider the "hmm" task, decide right there and then to know why it called out to you.<br><br>a) Is it because you have no plans to do it anymore? Then cross it out forever.<br>b) Is it because you have to prepare something before you can do it? This, I found, is a common reason for these "hmmm" tasks to stand out.  Therefore, do something to prepare yourself for the time these tasks are ready to be done.  <br><br>For a common example in my life: the "hmm" task is "buy vegetables."  Well, when this task stood out I do not have time to do it, but I must do it sometime...and yet it is standing out from all the rest right now.  So therefore I prepare for it: I prepare a grocery list of all that I need to buy, aside from the vegetables.<br><br>Other examples: "clean car" ---&gt; consolidate all the tasks for maintaining my car to be done in one day, then schedule that day.  "Clean house" ---&gt; make sure I have all the materials I will need, and break down the parts of the house that I need to clean for one particular day, then for the succeeding days, if needed.<br><br>c) Is it because you CAN do it, but you DON'T WANT to? This is the MOST COMMON case for me.  And I only have one solution for it: DO IT ^___^<br><br>God bless.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2011 at 18:14 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You are permitted to decide No and delete things any time.

It doesn't mean you "do it" right now, just do "something", like delete it, or reword it, or prepare for it, or schedule it, or defer it.<br><br>God bless.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2011 at 18:43 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well, I tend to just give them their chance to grab my attention and if they don't, dismiss them.

It would probably be better to say that I'm not willing enough to dismiss items. Yet, when I read Will's post it struck me that until I'm firm in the system (2.5 weeks now I think) I don't trust that I'll review my dismissed items often enough and hence not trust the system. Yes, there's a lot of post-GTD stress there. Never was good at doing reviews.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 March 2011 at 1:52 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Unlike the Gtd weekly review, an entry in SF called Review is almost sure to be activated more or less regularly.
