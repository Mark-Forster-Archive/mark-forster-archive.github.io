Ideas will be added to your way of thinking, that may over time possibly eventually affect how you live, think, act.<br>b) Read with specific intent to act.  As you read, consider whether you agree, disagree, or don't understand.  (If you don't understand, read on, review, reflect, search for clarity.)  Consider the implications, and how you can put the ideas into action.  In this case there's exercises presented, so study, choose, and do stuff.  <br><br>I'd say choose (b) if what you're reading looks to have a significant positive application for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 May 2011 at 14:33 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For those who haven't got to the end yet, please note that there is "A Step by Step Course to Implement the Message of This Book" on the last two pages of the book.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 May 2011 at 15:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>How would you answer the "what's better" question, if the question was phrased: "what went well today"? I'm wondering why Mark went with better, rather than "went well". As well, I'm wondering about... "better than WHAT?"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 2:01 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum:<br><br>You're missing the point entirely. The aim of the "what's better?" question is to focus on growth. "What went well?" doesn't focus on growth.  "Well" doesn't imply growth - it could be an entirely static situation.<br><br>Better than what? Better than it was before obviously. The aim is to find something, however small, which is better in a situation. There's always something - even when everything else is a disaster.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 8:42 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>&lt;&lt;You're missing the point entirely.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Perhaps. Though I'm still having trouble understanding how you differentiated between "well" and "better", particularly during the introduction of this idea (in your book). <br><br>&lt;&lt;The aim of the "what's better?" question is to focus on growth&gt;&gt;<br><br>I agree. But to do this, you need a starting point... something to compare progress to. In your book, you state: <br><br> "A good question to ask instead is, ‘What are the good things that happened today?’<br>An even better question is, ‘What was better about today?’<br><br>Again, better than what? You go on to give a few examples i.e. Had a brilliant idea for a new seminar,  of what went well with your day. I don't see how that is better than your previous day. <br><br>I'm wondering if things would be clearer, for me anyway, if I did the "better than..." exercise AFTER doing the GAM method. This would provide a reference point for an honest answer. Otherwise, as I've experienced the last two nights, I'm answering the question: "What went well with my day". Not bad, but I prefer your suggested question: "What went better..."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 15:01 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Avrum:<br>&lt;&lt;Had a brilliant idea for a new seminar, of what went well with your day. I don't see how that is better than your previous day&gt;&gt;<br><br>The previous day, there was no brilliant idea for a new seminar, which makes today better than yesterday. <br><br>I would've thought that what's better meant anything that made you feel good about your day, and not necessarily in relation to any previous point in time either. In fact, it could mean just feeling good about something in the here and now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 15:30 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>JD - <br><br>I find these folks: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://quantifiedself.com/">http://quantifiedself.com/</a> inspiring, in that they provide self-help/productivity efforts a degree of accountability and metrics. I think this helps avoid two things: <br><br>1. Delusional self i.e. Wow, I'm so much better than yesterday<br>2. Berating self i.e. Wow, I've done nothing since yesterday<br><br>I cycle everyday. I have no idea if I "did better" today than yesterday. To move from "what went well today" vs "what is better today", I think some form of metric would be helpful. <br><br>&lt;&lt;In fact, it could mean just feeling good about something in the here and now. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Which is fine. But, to my mind, that would answer: "What went well today..."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 16:18 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>JD:<br><br>&lt;&lt; In fact, it could mean just feeling good about something in the here and now. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Only if you weren't feeling good, or as good, about it previously.

So for instance if you goal is weight loss, it is easy less is better.  If your goal is exercise, more is usually better.  I walked for 20 minutes versus 15 minutes.  The better than concept is a great in the moment questions to use.  What is a better use of my time.  It is also a great feedback tool. what could I have done better to get a better outcome.  I am also enjoying the book.  Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 16:43 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Mark - much appreciated. Thank you. I very much enjoyed this book. Actually, your approach to goal-setting (intuition, etc) is very much in tune with what Steven Pressfield is discussing in his new book: "Do the work". <br><br>@Gerry - I'm fine without specific metrics. However I found dong the "what's better..." exercise, BEFORE having any short/long term goals or vision, confusing. <br><br>This discussion has helped, thanks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 16:53 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry:<br><br>I agree that measuring what is measurable is a great tool. But it's not actually what this particular exercise is about. <br><br>The difference is that in the example you give you are measuring exercise results. To do this, you monitor how long you walked for (and/or other variables such as speed) on a daily basis. You may have other results you are monitoring but they are always specific.<br><br>Measurement of specifics like this is done in the "Current Situation" rather than in "What's Better?"<br><br>The aim of the "What's better?" list is to identify the growth points during the day, whatever they are.  Certainly you might include an exercise result in your in your list, but the majority of items on the list will be things that you didn't set out specifically to measure. <br><br>The theory behind it is that paying attention to problems tends to result in more problems, while paying attention to growth tends to result in more growth.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 16:58 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"What's better" makes perfect sense to me.  For any particular item, you compare it to things you remember previously.  Every good new idea counts, because it adds to your idea collection.  If you fix your car, the car is better.  If you lost a pound, your physique is better.  If you discovered a great source for strawberry rhubarb pie, your knowledge of pies is better.<br><br>I suppose mostly you would focus on goal-related things and reflect on what things mean your goal is closer to becoming reality.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 May 2011 at 17:16 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark - what was your thinking vis-a-vis to-do lists...

The word "growth" ended up standing out for me to make this idea concrete. I realize one might still say, "growth compared to what?" but for me the "growth" term feels easier to apply intuitively without getting bogged down in semantics. Simply: "what growth have you experienced today?" However, as I'm only about to start my *second* What's Better list, I am really not one to talk at this point (I haven't let it stop me, though!).<br><br>As for the self-coaching, I just made it through the Goal Ach. Method exercises today, so I have not started the actual dialog yet. I too feel a little "performance anxiety" about this, but I am hoping it won't feel much weirder than the talking to myself that I do anyway (aloud!) when I work out ideas.<br><br>From the rather naive perspective of Day Two, I can so far say this: today, I got done everything that mattered without really looking at the list I made last night or doing much SF scanning (even stayed caught up with my email without really noticing). I did use SF for most tasks, but I tended to write in C2 things that just came to me, mostly things that I know are on the list someplace and seemed to fit in nicely, while doing one or two semi-related C1's to turn pages. More importantly, I felt much more relaxed about getting everything done. Hmmm, there's one for the What's Better list!<br><br>&lt;&lt;By the way - would anyone be interested in discussing the above info via Skype?&gt;&gt;<br>Interesting idea, though I (still) don't Skype.

One I wasn't motivated to do at all and the daily journaling allowed me to realize why. It's been subsumed into a "main goal" project (that I had found through the daily writing a few months ago).<br><br>I've been dialogging by talking to myself in the car during my commute.

The problem with short-term goals is that they are often too prescriptive of how you are going to get to your vision. As soon as you start setting time targets and working out actions that need to be done by them you are committing yourself to a specific way of getting to where you want to be. You have ceased to allow your mind to be creative about achieving the goal."<br>(found under 27 August, section labeled "Short-term goals," p. 62 of 137 in my downloaded version)<br><br>If you are going to climb a mountain for two weeks, you will want to put a lot of planning into your gear and provisions, but you will not want to plan in advance where to place each footstep among the rocks on the trail. There is a right level of planning that takes place at the level of vision and tools and process, but not at the level of a step-by-step script. The script is rigid and fragile and will keep you spinning your wheels updating and researching whenever something changes. Ryan's "anti-fragility" topic at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1497737">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1497737</a> relates to this.<br><br>It strikes me that _Dreams_ is about this right level of planning: how to think about it, how to do it, and how to keep it working. It feels like exactly what I need to pay attention to right now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 May 2011 at 22:23 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In "Dreams", Mark suggests working on a small goal i.e. Email backlog, before tackling a large 3-5 year dream/goal.

How good are my beliefs about what will really bring me the quality of being I seek?<br><br>- What is my higher purpose? The desire that would bring most joyful self-expression of my talents? I use my imagination to bring forward a symbol to represent the energy of that purpose. I dialogue with it or draw it to see what it has to "say".<br><br>- What would I need to let go of or outgrow in order to pursue it?<br><br>- How is this furture me different?<br><br>- What activities arise from comparing Present Time with Highest and Best Future?

I was also very keen to find a mechanical method which used the power of the unconscious mind in the way that Dreams did.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Mark, I was actually struck by this as I read _Dreams_ shortly after learning SFv3. Learning about Pull led me to see "standing out" as a filter for tasks where I felt that Pull. It was like cutting through all the visioning and dialoging and just going for whatever Pull was already there, latent, in the subconscious. Of course, this is more limited than the _Dreams_ method, because it means passively accepting whatever vision you have grown to accept at the moment, rather than working to shape your vision. But at least you get work in Pull mode, which is quite a lot of fun!<br><br>I have really enjoyed the vast majority of my SFv3 tasks, whether or not they were ultimately worth doing. I am convinced that SF will continue to be my way of reminding myself to do the little things while I am working on my _Dreams_ goals, doing both the little things and the big things in Pull mode, writing down only the things that I'd otherwise forget, in an extremely lightweight system ... isn't that the holy grail of time management?<br><br>We shall see whether SF fades away or not as I progress through the exercises.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2011 at 8:44 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;re-type your future reality afresh daily.&gt; &lt;"That's a lot of work". &gt;<br><br>Personally I journal a lot and believe writing out the vision is more visceral and engages more of who I am in the vision. It's also an act of loving kindness to myself to dedicate some time to what I want from living, or else what's the point of outer productivity when inner qualities come second. So it's not so much work as play or priority. For me the process has led to seeking the qualities in experiences - aceptance, tolerance, joy, patience, peace as "goals". It's the quality of being that is the real goal. The stuff is just the way to realise it or express it or allow it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2011 at 8:44 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br>&lt;&lt;1) I think I need to encourage people to take the initial step of faith - acting according to their feelings - at an early stage.

A goal like that can become a burden until you work out why you want it. Once you've done that you can often achieve what you want more directly.

I attract people who share my enthusiasm for life, and I take care to maintain those relationships.<br><br>You will note that, as before, the content is much the same, but there are some subtle changes in the flow. The biggest change is in the part about friendships. <br><br>So far my Present Reality is much more about how I do things than about what I do. Whether it will stay that way I have no idea.<br><br>I wrote it about four hours ago, and already I can see a few changes I want to make!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2011 at 13:20 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;I thought it might be useful to post today's version of my Future Reality:&gt;&gt;<br><br>Mark - a few days ago I asked about speaking (into a recorder) vs writing (as you've done) the future/present realities. I prefer to record these as I walk - though I'm not sure if I'm getting the full effect. Do you have any evidence to suggest that writing trumps recording the spoken word? Have you tried recording the audio? Curious.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2011 at 14:24 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Michael:<br><br>&lt;&lt;...dedicate some time to what I want from living, or else what's the point of outer productivity when inner qualities come second&gt;&gt;<br><br>Nicely put.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2011 at 15:14 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie:<br><br>&lt;&lt;The past few days, I have been tempted to break the rules and skip ahead to the larger vision,&gt;&gt;<br><br>I worked on this yesterday.

I hope though that you have one of those audio recorders on which you can date/tag the recordings because there are times when it's useful to go back and compare your Present Reality today with, say, a week or a month ago.<br><br>Also once your Future Reality has settled down for the time being, you might want to type it out and put it where you can see it while you work (probably better than playing it aloud to yourself on a continuous loop!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2011 at 16:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum:<br><br>&lt;&lt; The hardest part - for me - was to get past the critical, perfectionist inner-voice proclaiming I'm doing this wrong... or that my vision isn't compelling. &gt;&gt;<br><br>The best way to think of it is that you are writing a happy ending to a novel about yourself. In "Dreams" I advised people who had difficulty deciding on a compelling vision to write two or more different happy endings and then choose one. And of course your novel will have some sequels!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2011 at 16:24 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think this thread is now too long to be manageable, so I am going to close it down and start a new one.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2011 at 16:34 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
