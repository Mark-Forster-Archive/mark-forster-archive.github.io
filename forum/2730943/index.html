Start a new left-hand page every day, and start the new No-List there. Previous pages are not visible unless you specifically go review them.<br><br>My personal variant of No List is simple. Start with a blank page. Write down all the things that come to mind. Then scan and do whatever stands out. Sometimes I use a "Simple Scanning" approach, sometimes more like FVP. The list is so short, it doesn't really matter.<br><br>The idea is to keep it light. Treat the list as a throw-away, "dynamic list". In the past, this is literally what I would do. Write the list on a scrap of paper, and frequently throw it away and start over. Or even better, write the list on my whiteboard, then erase everything except the top 2-3 items. Erase and start over whenever I want. Very light, very dynamic. <br><br>This current experiment takes the same attitude, but doesn't actually throw away the old lists. They are still there in my notebook. But I generally don't look at them while I'm working. The main rule is never to START with the old lists. Start the day FRESH, with whatever is currently top-of-mind. Only look at the old pages during downtime, or maybe at the end of the day.<br><br>Here is what I am finding so far:<br>-- I am able to keep a very strong intuition for my whole context, all the time.<br>-- This allows me to get to the heart of whatever I really need to be doing, quickly, and stay focused on it.<br>-- Retaining the old pages prevents me from forgetting important details and deadlines, without the need for supplementary lists. This is a big improvement over my previous runs with No-List.<br>-- I don't collect a lot of administrivia / recurring tasks. Those mostly take care of themselves, or quickly become routines. (No-List always seems to have that effect.) This is in contrast to Long List systems, which seem to accumulate a lot of these kinds of tasks.<br>-- Overall I feel much more engaged with my WORK and whatever is in front of me -- rather than with my LIST. It feels light and nimble, focused, engaged, fresh, aware, responsive.<br>-- Retaining the older pages also somehow seems to keep me a little more grounded, compared to previous runs with No-List. Previously  could start going so fast that I'd wear myself out. That doesn't seem to be happening now. Not sure why, exactly, since I almost never even look at those older pages.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2019 at 5:42 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Some background on why this new experiment.<br><br>For most of 2017 till mid/late 2018, I was using a system roughly based on DIT with some elements of Theory of Constraints woven into the process to help with focus and to deal with overload. It was working well, and I liked it, but also liked what I was hearing with Mark’s roll-out of Simple Scanning. So after returning to work after a long vacation, I decided to start fresh with Simple Scanning.<br><br>But I soon ran into my old friend - the list growing out of control. As Mark wrote, &lt;&lt;  The big limitation with any catch-all system comes as the list grows faster than you are capable of actioning it. &gt;&gt;<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/7/25/answer-to-the-puzzle.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/7/25/answer-to-the-puzzle.html</a><br><br>Reflecting on this, it seems the critical reason to cycle through the list quickly, is to maintain a strong intuition for the list as a whole. You need this so things will Stand Out the way they should. You also need this so you know what you can delete. <br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2725530">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2725530</a><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2725827">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2725827</a><br><br>So next I tried finding ways to accelerate cycling through the list. Sometimes it works, simply to tell your intuition to cycle faster; i.e., not to allow things to stand out too easily. But that breaks down for me after a couple days of meetings and minor emergencies. I just can't get through the whole list reliably.<br><br>So I tried experimenting with combining Randomizer into the process, to speed up processing of the older pages.<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2728961">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2728961</a><br><br>But ultimately the randomizer approach left me feeling even more out of touch with the list as a whole, so when I tried using Standing Out on the most current pages, it just wasn't working. <br><br>Then Jane said something about her success with No-List that prompted some reflection on the fact that No-List also maintains a very strong intuition for one's whole context.<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2728605#post2729856">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2728605#post2729856</a><br><br>And that led to this latest experiment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2019 at 5:43 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here is perhaps a simpler way to describe what I’m doing. Think of it as a variant of Simple Scanning:<br><br>(1) You have a notebook with all your tasks.<br><br>(2) At beginning of the day, open to a new left-hand page so no older tasks are visible. Write today’s date at the top of the page.<br><br>(3) Write down whatever is top-of-mind, whatever you really need or want to do, whatever really needs to get done.<br><br>(4) Scan through today’s tasks repeatedly, doing whatever stands out<br><br>(5) Cross out and re-enter tasks as usual <br><br>(6) Add new tasks as usual<br><br>(7) Keep cycling through today’s tasks until nothing stands out <br><br>(8) When nothing on today’s list stands out (which rarely happens in practice), cycle back to the beginning of the list and follow the usual Simple Scanning rules till you eventually return to today’s page, at which point, continue from (4)<br><br><br>Hopefully this rewrite of the process doesn’t remove the No-List feel of the process. Today’s list is like a No-List, and the previous days’ pages are like an archive of old No-Lists that are interesting to keep around but don’t have a lot of pull.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2019 at 16:19 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The problem I see here is the mentality that you have to do all that is in a Long List.<br><br>You don't have to.

The nice thing about experiments is that I am expecting them to fail, at least sometimes. I am doing the experiment not so much to "have the perfect system" but simply to LEARN. It's been great, I've been getting so many new insights into HOW and WHY these systems work the way they do. But there's a side benefit -- this approach just seems to help the method itself work better. There is no sense of "breaking the rules" or any kind of obligation. I'm just experimenting. It helps keep it light and fresh.<br><br>-- This method is kind of like an inverse AF4, with no dismissal. <br><br>AF4 is described here: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/9/5/preliminary-instructions-for-autofocus-v-4.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/9/5/preliminary-instructions-for-autofocus-v-4.html</a><br><br>AF4 has a "Backlog" and an "Active List". You cycle through the Backlog till nothing stands out. Only then do you move forward to the Active List, and you make only one pass through it, acting on whatever stands out. Then you go back to the Backlog. If nothing stands out on your first pass through the Backlog, you dismiss the whole Backlog, your Active List becomes your new Backlog, and you start a new Active List.<br><br>Thus AF4 keeps a lot of attention focused on the older, unactioned things, and puts pressure to make sure those things get actioned or get dismissed.<br><br>This new No-List method I am using is almost the opposite. You start a new Active List every day. You cycle through it till nothing stands out (which rarely happens). Only then do you go look at the old stuff. When I review the old stuff, I usually do it in reverse order -- first looking at yesterday's No-List, then the day previous, and so on, back to the oldest page with uncrossed items. There is no dismissal and no pressure of any kind.<br><br>Thus it keeps attention focused on the stuff that's currently moving and active, and takes you back to the older stuff only when you are ready for it, and there is no pressure at all. I find I don't need any pressure -- it only causes problems. The work itself has plenty of intrinsic motivation behind it, especially when it gets the right level of focus and can build momentum without needless distractions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2019 at 5:55 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>The method you've just described is pretty similar to what I'm doing, except I'm combining my No-List with the day's schedule and calling it a Day Page. Each day gets a new page that remains visible all day (no flipping to other pages) and expires at the end of the day.<br><br>Down the left side, I map out my day linearly from top to bottom: morning things at the top, evening things at the bottom. If I don't have anything special going on midday, then the middle span stays empty. This gives me a great visual way to mark transitions and reminders, such as "bring glasses cleaner" written just above "--&gt; work" near the top of the page, or "ask R flight dates" in the lower section to remind me to ask R when I see her after work. A quick glance tells me all I need to stay on track.<br><br>Down the right side of the Day Page, I start by writing the top few things that are already on my mind to do, then any additional items that come up during the day and the big-picture things I decide to work on. As I work through these items, a SMEMA-style list often takes shape, of the next 2 or 3 things I intend to do. When I want to spend some time on my Long List, I write "LL session" here.<br><br>The Day Page is thus the driver of my day, with committed time on the left and discretionary time on the right. Items only make it onto the Long List if they are still alive at the end of the day I entered them in the Day Page AND they do not belong on the next Day Page due to being time-bound or on my mind that next morning. The Long List tends to collect background tasks, routines, things with a lifetime of more than a day, and future priorities. I try to move future priorities off the Long List into project planning files, so that might happen directly without a stop on the Long List, if I happen to feel clear about it when first moving it off the Day Page.<br><br>In the back of my Day Page notebook, I keep a running shopping/errand list, so that I can grab this one notebook on the way out for appointments/errands to have a complete program of where I need to be when, and what are my top options to do or buy on the way, and even the "real" place to jot down incoming things (that right-hand column). I don't have to drag along my Long List notebook if I'm just doing a bunch of errands and coming back home again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 January 2019 at 20:06 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim, I'm persuaded to try this.

I suppose if I had gone ahead without a separate Long List, my system would be even closer to yours!<br><br>BTW, in both of my notebooks, I've started on the last page, and I work from the bottom page of the book to the top.
