I thought "little and often" was a key component of Autofocus.  I didn't say anything wrong with being at the end of my list, since I'm getting things done (or so I believed until now).  Now, having read this, I am worried that my progress has been only superficial, and that I'm somehow doing this wrong, even though it felt like it was working.

It's a neurotic concern;  I am getting tons of work done.  But since I am involved in a few large, long-term projects, there is a great deal of "unfinished work" in my life right now.

I definitely haven't been getting through the list at least once on a normal day, and that has been starting to feel like an issue. I seem to have a mix of symptoms, though (that is, of too much vs. not enough "little and often"), so I'm not sure how best to adjust. But I'll think about this. My hypothesis about slow movement had been a different one: that perhaps what I'm counting as "standing out" is too generous.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2009 at 18:37 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Martin:<br><br>Do what you do with a real knob on a radio or sound system - twist it to the extremes to see what they are like and then find the right level.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2009 at 18:42 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Steve,<br>I am not sure if I am doing it right, but I don't feel I will be back to any other systems of the past, even to the to do list I used for five years despite GTD.

I've been working mainly at the end of my lists for a few days because of limited time availability but I think for me a big part of the fear factor relates to the fact that the system *is* working so well.  That in itself makes me think something must be wrong .......... because I can't stick to systems ....... :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 0:53 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think the amount of discretionary time you have plays a huge part in where on the list you spend most of your time.  On a good day during the work week, I only work on one or two pages on the home list, where I'll run through all 16 active pages on the weekend.<br><br>I only have 4 active pages at work and don't have an issue.

The whole "too many commitments" concept tends to invoke the need for decision making about importance--exactly that which AF makes unnecessary. Rereading this makes me want to get through my list quicker and also helps me see that I have some inappropriately worded tasks. For example, I have several tasks to watch specific movies. Movie watching is not conducive to little and often. Instead, I could have "Plan time to watch unwatched movie" or something like that. Thanks for bringing this thread back. It is helpful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 14:25 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel, that's what dismissal is though (for me) - accepting that I don't have the time to commit to that project at the expense of other things that I want to do - for now at least.   Maybe that's because I don't feel much resistance to doing most things as long as my energy level is there and I'm not feeling overwhelmed.  For me, not getting through my pages often enough was entirely due to the fact that I was attempting to take on too many projects at once - basically overloading the system and creating chaos all around me and overwhelm in my mind.   So I dismissed ALOT - I think something like 180+ tasks in my home book.  <br><br>In some cases, there has to be decision making about things to take on.  For example, if I'm doing a home renovation and I have $X and X time to complete it in, I'm not going to put in the "nice to have's" at the expense of the essentials.  Sometimes some things really are more important than others.  <br><br>I've also clarified to myself that getting my house renovated before on time really is more important than having it spic and span all the time.  So I've dialed up my little and often on the house cleaning items and dialed it down on the renovation items by changing the wording or grouping or ungrouping things.  <br><br>This was one of Mark's most helpful posts to me and I think more people should read it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 17:19 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel:<br><br>I watch movies "little and often" all the time. The important thing is to write down the timer reading so you know where to start from next time if your system doesn't remember it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 17:47 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline, I knew that's what you meant as you've shared your mass dismissal. :-) I agree with you, but don't want people to think they have to make rational decisions about what to do and what not to do. It's been wonderful for me to dismiss things and discover later that some of these tasks do in fact get done. I just don't have to have them on my radar screen in the meantime.<br><br>Mark, I was actually thinking about this after I wrote it. I just finished watching Casablanca in 3 sessions last week. :-) The movies I'm having trouble with are movies I want my kids to watch with me. That will require scheduling as they're not likely to go along with my little and often plan. Nor are they very willing to drop everything to watch a movie when it happens to pop up on my list. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2009 at 19:36 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Brilliant thread.
