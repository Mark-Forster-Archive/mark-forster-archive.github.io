Or whether it is individual/situationally based.

One of which is batched and recurres most days: 'Clear Inboxes &amp; red tasks'. I usually have around 10-15 daily inbox tasks to update and 'red tasks' (approx 5-10 small items) are held in Outlook tasks and have reached their due date - great for tasks that require reviewing. The other 2 daily slots are for doing bigger tasks / parts of projects.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 December 2011 at 14:41 | leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In my AF1-like, project-oriented monstrosity that lives in OneNote, I have:<br><br>- About 50 active recurring tasks (many recur several times per day such as checking and clearing email; others approximately daily such as checking how my son's broken nose from his bicycle accident is healing; others recur approximately weekly such as watering the trees)<br><br>- About 35 active projects each consisting of 5 to 30 tasks<br><br>- About 200 random one-off tasks (misc emails to respond to, articles to read, one-off phone calls, actions or requests, and the like).  A lot of this seems important or interesting at first -- and before finding Mark Forster, I probably would have just started reading it or acting on it immediately.  Now it goes into the list and percolates.  Some of the items turn out to be project-related so they get moved to a project page.  And many of the one-off items are actually important, and they usually get done pretty quickly.  But the rest sits there for a few cycles, perhaps serving as an interesting mental break -- an article with some nice insight into epistemology for example, which has no practical value that I can really see but is always interesting to me.  But probably 80% of those leftover items are eventually dismissed.<br><br>Right now it's all personal stuff since I'm on vacation.   My personal stuff tends to be about three times as much as my work stuff.   Which is kinda backwards since when I'm working, I have about 5 times as much time for work as I do for personal stuff.   Which is probably why I always feel on top of my work but my personal / family projects are always a mess.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 December 2011 at 16:26 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Work list: 30 open tasks on 2 pages<br>Home list: 37 open tasks on 3 pages</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 December 2011 at 17:05 | Christian G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Running separate SF lists for work and home I have<br>  Work: 86 open tasks on 10 pages<br>  Home: 34 open tasks on  7 pages<br>The oldest task in the work list is from October 3rd - indicative of the fact that I rarely manage to cycle through the whole list each day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 December 2011 at 20:08 | Richard Stamper</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My work list is pretty steady between 70 and 80 tasks.

Tasks don't need to be finished. It's a measure of how much work it will take to clear all the entries currently in the system. It's particularly useful for tracking the trend of how well you are keeping up with the tasks you are adding to the list.

Or, at least nobody here indicated otherwise. And that was basically what I intended to ask about. My idea was, that as each of us needs different stress level, or different level of tidiness or different level of spontaneity/rules to feel optimally, maybe we tend to have the same level of various tasks defined in front of us...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 December 2011 at 19:30 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark: as for the "objective" measures of productivity, I doubt that we can define it by task characteristics.

So there is no need to worry about the varying amount of time you spend on individual tasks.

If I fight a surprise fire and know I did the right thing, I'll be satisfied, even though I didn't finish stuff on time. Likewise, if I finished all my less-important stuff I'd get a lot finished, but not be satisfied. Taken together, the answers become meaningful. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Doing something ("the surprise fire") when it should have been done (i.e. immediately) is a good example of everything getting done when it should be done. <br><br>Doing a lot of things ("my less important stuff") when they shouldn't have been done (i.e. instead of more important things) is a good example of everything not getting done when it should be done.<br><br>So the "How far do you feel that everything is getting done when it should be done?" scale should suit you very well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 December 2011 at 23:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon:<br><br>&lt;how far you feel that everything is getting done when it should be done.&gt;<br><br>&lt;How satisifed do I feel with what I have done today'? &gt;<br><br>&lt;&lt; I would say these are 2 different statements with different meanings.&gt;&gt;<br><br>So, if I understand you correctly, whether you feel satisfied with what you have done today is a quite different thing from getting things done when they should be done?<br><br>Or to put it another way, if you were to fail to get things done when they should have been done that wouldn't make you feel any less satisfied with your work?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 December 2011 at 23:22 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Possible typo?<br><br>Mark wrote: (replying to Alan, 23:00 Dec 6)<br>&lt;&lt;Please note that The Number of Days' Work Remaining in the System is a measure of how much work is required to action all the items currently on your list.

These three figures (or actually the two sets of three figures - one for work one for home tasks) give me an good indication how I'm getting along:<br>* if the number of open tasks is getting higher than usual, I'm getting hesitant to take new commitments<br>* if the numer of open pages gets to high (esp. the ratio of pages to tasks), I'm trying to speed up the "circulation"<br>* if the oldest tasks are older than a month, I try to "kill" them one or the other way next time I'm on the respective page<br>Regards and have a nice "4.
