My sense is that all these Time Management systems provide a "Honeymoon period" that lasts a few weeks or even more  -- but then things go slack and the "thrill is gone."  Thoughts?  In my own experience, the "Unschedule" by Neil Fiore is one time-management tool to which I keep returning over the years, always with success. And I'd say the same thing about DIT.<br>What do other people think?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2009 at 12:19 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Steve<br><br>I hope you don't mind a small jocular comment on your "success" with Unschedule.  Is it a bit like the man who said, "It's easy to give up smoking.  I've done it lots of times."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2009 at 12:49 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As someone who quit smoking three times, I can certainly relate.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2009 at 14:07 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I did AF1 for two  to three continuous months before going off of it.  I read about DIT here on the website and liked the principles and tried it for a while the best I could without havng the book.  I then went to something like GTD. I tried AF2 and AF3 for a brief time. When AF4 came out, I tried it, and have been using it continuously until this week.  I spent most of yesterday revamping and archiving my system. I use the program ECCO PRO.  <br>What I like about the AFs is that it is easy to get started and easy to maintain, there is always something to do, there is plenty of variety.  I like the concept of closed and open lists. <br>I don't do the dismissal/review well.  Often I can't figure out what to do with many of the  items, and just let them languish.  This hasn't been a problem because most of them I won't do anyway, or when the time comes to do it, I just do it without referring to the list.  Yesterday I put a lot of these in a date folder which acts like a tickler file to remind me about them later. <br>The trouble I have is with the active lists. After a while, the number of items grow and grow, and I become overwhelmed with the number of items to choose from, and feel like I am wasting some of the time going through the list, when I could just filter out the items I know I won't do today.  <br>The real problem I have is with tasks that are time-consuming which will take hours, that are urgent or important and that I am resisting or avoiding.  These tasks don't seem to get done by doing AF alone.  I had a job application that I was delaying for 2 weeks, and did little and often, but I wasn't getting it done, and finally timeboxed an hour to it. I still didn't finish it, and timeboxed another hour and finally finished it. <br>Or I will do little and often on some work projects, but as the deadline approaches, I still have several hours of work left, and will have to devote several hours to it. WIth the AF4 lists there is plenty to distract me and do.  <br>I read this forum regularly, and appreciate Mark Forster's help.  Perhaps AF4 isn't meant to be a complete system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2009 at 15:34 | mark s</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've also found that "little and often" works with certain types of tasks which can be effectively broken into small pieces  (i.e. like this weekend I'm reading a pile of stories by my students -- a little bit at a time -- and it's the only way to go) . But with a long project -- like finishing writing a book  -- there's also a point where I just have to sit down and work for several hours straight, sometimes for several days straight.  Hopefully the momentum of the book (or whatever the project is) will carry me along. A deadline also helps.  In fact, a deadline does wonders, at least for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2009 at 17:17 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As I wrote in another thread:<br>My productivity went up with every new version of AF and my to-do lists were shrinking. Before AF I always had 200-250 items on my to-do list at least, with AF1 it went down to around 130, with AF2 to around 110, with AF3/RAF to 80/90 and now with AF I'm at approx. 60 items (and scattered across less active pages, 5-6 normally).<br><br>Now I have even less open pages, 3-4 actually</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2009 at 17:22 | Christian G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have been happy with several weeks of list-free productivity. I put deadlined or time-sensitive tasks on my calendar, but everything else I am not writing down. So far I love it. But as with any approach, I may still be in the honeymoon phase. Here is my particular problem with lists:<br><br>I never feel finished, like I've had a truly winning day. There are still more tasks being added day upon day. I never do as much as I hope I will. DIT is a great way of feeling finished, but I could never get through all the tasks before the line, leaving me with the same feeling of disappointment. <br><br>My situation is unique in that I honestly don't have that many things that have to be done by a specific day. Focusing only on those gives me such a feeling of peace that I can accomplish more than I was using my AF list. Reviewing a big list of potential things to do contributes to overwhelm for me. Thinking of productivity in terms of numbers just discourages me. I now have no expectations of what I will accomplish (aside from the tasks that must be done today), so I always feel good about my day. This is the approach that my very successful, productive husband uses. I don't know why I never tried it before! The tasks that shouldn't be done just don't get done. I spend no time pouring over lists or even making them. <br><br>That said, for people who have many time-sensitive tasks, AF is the ideal way of determining what to do at any given time. It is the best time management approach I've used to date. I think I've just discovered I don't really need one.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2009 at 17:29 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have switched to the newer version almost as soon as it came out.  So I have been doing AF is some flavor since the Beta phase in January.  Before that, I had tried GTD but never got to fully implement it before I realized I was just wasting my time on a system I wouldn't use.  Prior to that, I didn't really have a system although I have read Covey's 7 Habits.  Lots of notes and emails, but no system and no plan.<br><br>So this is good for me.  The only statistics I keep are open and closed page counts and the number of outstanding tasks.  I have been hovering around 145-160 tasks.  It has hardly varied from that range since about Feb.  But I have almost filled a 70 page sprral, so there is progress.  Friday, I actually reviewed all my "Dismissed" items.  For the most part they were deleted with more than a few being added back to the list since they seemed ready to be done.  A couple were left in a "Dismissed" status as on a someday/maybe list.  I wasn't ready to do them, but not ready to completely write them off either.  So now i am up over 170.  But that's OK since the increase was fully expected.<br><br>One thing I have noticed is that when I feel like I have been productive, I have usually added more tasks than I completed.  Looking over those added that day, they are often new or fully revamped old ones.  Not just rewrites of those that got a little work.  Days when I feel like I haven't got much done, the overall numbers have gone down.  This all seem opposite of what I would have expected.  I have no idea if it is good, bad, or just is what it is.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2009 at 23:56 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel~I am intrigued by your post here. So what DO you use to determine what you do (aside from time-sensitive items or daily tasks). Goals?  What just appears as *next" to do? And while I'm asking, what do you use for those daily tasks such as check email, walk the dog, errands, etc?<br><br>I love the idea of making peace with how I manage my day. Could you elaborate a bit? <br>Thanks,<br>Beth</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2009 at 0:17 | Beth L</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;The tasks that shouldn't be done just don't get done. I spend no time pouring over lists or even making them. &gt;<br><br>Yes, Mel, but I wonder how many tasks that should be done also do not get done.  You are right that allowing myself to be reminded of all the things that I have conscientiously decided to carefully consider doing can be a bit overwhelming at times.  But the alternative is to live in the darkness and often being a pain to those who are relying on me to keep commitments.  I am constantly amazed by the thoughtlessness of people who promise to do things and let me down time after time.  Sometimes the "peace" of forgetfulness is a scourge for other people.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2009 at 1:11 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel,<br><br>I like the idea.  I actually wrote an article about calendar based time management at one point.  The reality is that it is perfectly legitimate to ask when will you actually do something and by using a calendar, you can answer the question with tuesday at 10:00 am in a calendar.  My problem is I could not use it exclusively as I would still need a list of the things I need to accomplish somewhere.<br><br>I sometimes wonder if people are putting to much on list based time management systems.  I no longer write things like tidy desk etc as I try to limit my list to the most impactful issues.<br><br>As far as long term satisfaction, I think us time management fans are by nature tinkerers and we like to experiment and try new things.  I am forcing myself to stick with my new system.<br><br>Gerry<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2009 at 1:25 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Beth, as a Christian, I believe I am led to the next thing to do. Some people call that intuition. Often, the next thing becomes quite obvious! As you said, if the dog is going nuts, it's time to take him for a walk (or her in my case ;-). I do have a basic structure to my day and my week, too. But I try to remain flexible. Here is a blog post that explains what I'm doing:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://wonderwomen.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/09/from-todo-to-tadone.html">http://wonderwomen.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/09/from-todo-to-tadone.html</a><br>I am not trying to convince anyone here to use my approach. That wouldn't be appropriate on this forum anyway! Mark's methods and writing are brilliant and they work. I may return to them should my life circumstances change in the future. But for now, I have the peace that I wanted.<br><br>Jim, I couldn't agree more. I can't have the peace I need if I am letting other people down. If anyone is counting on me for something, it is either done immediately, is so pertinent that I can't forget (or my 3yo won't let me), or I put a reminder on my calendar. My current approach is to determine how much lead time I need to finish something and to give myself a reminder based on that. That way if I haven't gotten to it in the natural course of things, I will still have time to finish. Personally, I don't really need reminders for things other than, "Put book Maggie wants to borrow in my purse on Wednesday." That's especially true now that my mind is uncluttered with all the other things that were on my list. For example, do I really need "Clean the shower" on my list? Every day when I get in it, I'm reminded. When I'm ready to do it, I will. <br><br>Gerry, checked out your blog. Good stuff! I haven't been scheduling tasks as in, "Clean shower" on Tuesday at 10 a.m. That works so beautifully for some, but I tend to balk at that. In fact, if you told me I could do anything but clean my shower on Tuesday at 10 a.m., that's what I would do.

I found that AF2 didn't work for me, and went back to AF1.  I used AF3 ("RAF") as soon as it came out, and kept using it until AF4 came out.  I've been using AF4 since Sept 4th.<br><br>Steve wrote: <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;My sense is that all these Time Management systems provide a "Honeymoon period" that lasts a few weeks or even more -- but then things go slack and the "thrill is gone." &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>That lasted for about a week with GTD when I tried it a couple years ago.  I couldn't make that system work for me.  My lists were just too long.<br><br>Same with tools such as Toodledo and Remember the Milk.  Each of those lasted a month or two but eventually my workload just overwhelmed the tools (perhaps since I didn't have a coherent methodology for using the tools).  <br><br>I had also tried making a system out of Covey's various books.  But there really wasn't much of a system there -- just lots of intriguing ideas.  I was never able to make a workable system out of them.<br><br>Actually I had the same problem with DIT.  Maybe if I had known about the forums at that time, I would have discovered the system underneath all the principles.  I gleaned lots of good ideas from the DIT book, but was never able to use it as a single coherent systematic methodology.  (Same with Mark's earlier books -- great material, but I wouldn't have called any of them a "system".)<br><br>So, with Covey and DIT, I never had a working "system", so I can't say that I ever really "stuck" with them.<br><br>One tool I did use for several years was "Planner Pad" -- another paper-based tool.  (https://plannerpads.com/index.asp)   It had some good ideas behind it, and it was flexible and useful, but it was more of a handy tool than a complete methodology.   I was always trying to figure out the best way to use it, but never really landed on anything, and never really was able to handle all my workload with it.  I probably would have kept using it, but the calendar is an essential element of the Planner Pad, and once I started working at a company where everyone totally relies on Outlook for meetings and so on, I found I just couldn't use Planner Pad any more.  <br><br><br>AF (all variants but AF2) has been totally different from all these things.  It really does work as the foundation of a coherent system, but you can use whatever calendar, reminder, tickler, and software tools you already use.   For example, I could never get RTM or Toodledo or Gmail to do any kind of synchronization with Outlook calendar, Outlook tasks, or Outlook email.  With AF it just doesn't matter.<br><br>There has been a "honeymoon" burst of productivity with each variant of Planner Pad.  I do think part of that is the "newness factor".  But I think it's different than simply the newness of a new toy.  Rather, I think it's the fresh perspective it gives you on your tasks.  I've used the same list since February 2nd, and every time I've switched to a new AF variant, I've seen a different focus on different parts of the list.  That was enough in some cases to shake loose tasks that had been stuck for awhile, and to delete tasks that didn't really need to be done.  <br><br>But even after that newness factor wears off, after a week or two, I've found these systems to continue to be very effective.  I have found them to be "anchors" -- they have become my "default system".  <br><br>Here is what I mean by that.  For every other system I've tried, there has always come a point where the system is totally overwhelmed.  Either there is just too much to do, or there's an emergency of some kind, or some other major stress to the system.  And I have always been forced to abandon the system and deal with the stressor directly, using whatever ad-hoc method made sense at the time.  Once the event was over and things returned to "normal", it was always very difficult to get back into the swing of the system -- especially because I was worried what would happen the next time a major stressor came along.  <br><br>With AF, I have found that it handles these situations very well.  AF1 sometimes struggled with urgency, and I had a tweak where I'd just write everything on the last page and then start working that page, if there was ever an urgent situation.  It worked great.  RAF worked in a very similar way, and AF4 generally handles those situations even better.  <br><br>AF has handled these things SO well, in fact, that I have just simply come to depend on it.  When I start feeling overwhelmed and start going off in several directions at once, I've been finding that the path of least resistance is picking up my AF notebook and start working it, just following the rules.  That's what I mean about AF having become my "default" method of working.  It's like an anchor that always keeps me stable and focused.<br><br><br>Another thing about AF is that it's zero maintenance.  Every other system had some kind of mandatory "weekly review" or other housekeeping duties that you had to maintain, otherwise the whole thing would fall to pieces.  For me, when things start falling to pieces, I just pick up my AF book and I'm back in business.<br><br><br>Sorry for the long post -- in short, I don't think AF is just a honeymoon thing.  It has staying power.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2009 at 5:39 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oops, I wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;There has been a "honeymoon" burst of productivity with each variant of Planner Pad.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I meant to write:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;There has been a "honeymoon" burst of productivity with each variant of AF.&lt;&lt;&lt;</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2009 at 5:42 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim<br><br>No need to apologize for the long post.

LOL  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>There was a great hypnotist/psychiatrist named Milton Erickson.  One of his standard ways of facilitating change was to use strong resistance like that.  He tells a story of one person who woke up at night and could not go back to sleep.  He prescribed that when she woke up she must NOT go back to bed.  She must sit up at the kitchen table and do nothing.  But under NO CIRCUMSTANCES was she EVER to go back to bed.

Of course there is another approach ... you could roll completed tasks to a list of accomplishments and then use that as motivation for what you HAVE done.  I think some here have advocated that as justifying keeping abound book to see the huge numbers of completions.<br><br>In the end it is like so many other things ... a question of interpretation.  You can see tasks as opportunities, challenges, tests of strength, or nags.  You COULD have responded to that dental assistant with the feeling that there was an EVEN BETTER way you could maintain your health and have been genuinely excited to implement it.  Personally, I try to manage my own responses to situations.  If find that there will always be negatives in the world and I can choose to be brought down or lifted up ... simply my own choice.<br><br>I'm a big advocate of NLP.  NLP started by "modeling" people who had unusual skills, to find out HOW they did what they did.  One of the first, and most well known "patterns" in NLP is called "Changing Personal History".  It ultimately came about because of modeling people who had awful, abusive childhoods and yet somehow became dynamic and positive and productive adults.  In the course of modeling them it was learned that what they had done was simply CHANGE their history.  They CHOSE to see their childhoods as being happy.  IOW, there were these thousands of bad memories which were dim and fuzzy and one or two BIG BRIGHT SHINING memories of happiness.<br><br>I've heard over and over how this is deceptive.  It does not acknowledge reality.  It is lying to one's self.  One should acknowledge the ugliness in the world.  Yeah, fine, but these people are happy and productive and not looking back at those who tell them to SEE how awful things were.  I think it comes down to deciding what we want out of life.<br><br>Some ways other ways of putting it (from my collection of useful platitudes ;-)<br><br>"Either you are creating your life or the circumstances are." -- Thomas Leonard<br><br>"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing; the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."  -- Victor Frankel<br><br>"We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them." -- Epictetus<br><br>"The first thing a great person does, is make us realize the insignificance of circumstance." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2009 at 13:33 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, good point about the separate accomplishments list.

My sense is that all these Time Management systems provide a "Honeymoon period" that lasts a few weeks or even more -- but then things go slack and the "thrill is gone." "<br><br>I think there's a huge benefit to stepping back from a time management system every once in awhile and seeing what works, what doesn't - what comes naturally to you, what doesn't.  That's one of the things that I'm eternally grateful to Mark for AF - that it allowed me to get clarity on my natural patterns and way I like to work in every arena of life.  <br><br>For example, I couldn't use AF successfully at work because I already had a system that worked well for me and fit me like the proverbial glove (for about 8 years, so well past the honeymoon stage).  It has an element of current initiative like DIT (although I've been working this way predating DIT) that I worked on every day as my first priority.  I fell into this way of working because I started going into work a few hours before the rest of my group which allowed me the time to focus so that when everyone else showed up, I was available to answer questions and provide guidance.  I think it also depends very much on the job environment what type of system fits that work style.  For the rest of the day, I'm pretty much a "do it now" kind of worker - but because I work primarily on big projects, I don't leave a lot of time for these little tasks.  That means I have to plow through them quickly.   There seems to be less overhead that way as I have to keep very little in my head or on a list, the tasks pretty much all come in through email so I don't need a separate list.  There's an added bonus that I don't miss deadlines, so it fits me and what I want from a system - peace of mind that nothing's outstanding and that I'm moving forward on those "big rocks".<br><br>Using AF for home tasks helped me to realize that I wanted to and could work at home just the way I do at the office.  I had an "anchor system" all along and just didn't realize it.  Then I added elements of AF (stand out vs. schedule) into that anchor system and it worked even better.<br><br>I think AF (various forms) can be that anchor system for many people and that's great, but you can still use some of the elements of the system(s) in *any* system and it won't be AF or DIT, but can make your system more powerful.<br><br>Mike,<br>Love the old, dead Greek guy quote. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 September 2009 at 22:03 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel--Thanks for the reply.

It was not so much a cautionary tale, but more that I'm continually wrestling with that kind of thing myself so it is much on my mind.<br><br>We live in a world of such entitlement and harsh judgment and negativity that it can be stifling at times.  If you go to the market to buy a damn tomato the market acts as if it is doing you some great favor.  Safeway is a 24/7 operation down the trail a bit here.  But when I went in at 5:00AM one day there was no one to be seen and I could get no help and had to shout for someone to check me out ... to say nothing of them not knowing or caring about selling me a product I wanted.  My Prius has the dreaded interment headlight problem and Toyota pretends that they don't know what I mean ... though there are thousands of people on the Prius chat website with the problem and over 300 complained and got a recall investigation started -- which Toyota (having no sensitivity to irony) claims it is cooperating with 100%.  But no, Toyota never heard of a problem.<br><br>And what is this "for your convenience" crap?  "We are raising our prices for your convenience!"  "We are cutting service ... for your convenience."   Good Grief.  Everything is for my convenience ... NOT!  LOL ;-)  I saw some kitchen counter wipes in CostCo last week and they were labeled "Kills the H1N1 Flu Virus".  HUH?  Can a paper towel with a bit of diluted bleach and perfume kill a virus?  I really doubt it.  It is becoming the reification of that old joke: "How do you know if a politician is lying to you?"  "His lips are moving."  Just when I made peace with the fact that an honest politician is a contradiction in terms, now it seems as if I have to include every manufacturer, business, and service person.<br><br>Now obviously that is hyperbolic, but it is a measure of the level of toxicity of the environment these days.  So it comes down to continual frustration or acceptance of how it is and letting it roll off my back.  Tough for a 5, to be sure ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Frankl was able to rise above the evil in his captors. That doesn't mean he would ever choose to go back! Not comparing AF to Nazis. LOL!

I am a management consultant and project manager. Yet I am the most disorganised person by nature. Its my innovation and interpersonal skills that I relied upon for success in my work - but I was totally overwhelmed by zillions of tiny tasks that I kept putting off.<br><br>Since adopting AF I have been percieved as the most productive and organised person on the team!

I continue to be grateful to Mark for generously sharing his wisdom with us free of charge! And you're so right that it demands very little of us. <br><br>Mike, the H1N1 wipes--that is shocking to me, but it shouldn't be. We can be so easily manipulated now because of the constant input. Unless we lived in a cabin in the mountains, we will be affected by it all. Our job, it seems to me, is to limit the amount of input (turn off the TV, step away from the 'puter, etc.) and to refute the negative input with facts. Before the last month I think I wasn't doing enough of the latter. It feels good now that I'm more conscious of filtering.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 September 2009 at 20:18 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't think I've ever really had even a honeymoon with any task management systems.  I've done lots of flirting, even occasionally developing a bit of a relationship, but then I end up getting distant and we eventually just stop communicating entirely.  No harsh breakup, just a cold, empty heart, sometimes leaving myself unwilling to try courting a new system.  Sometimes I go back for a fling with an old system, but I usually end up just feeling worse afterwards as I'm reminded of all the things I didn't do.<br><br>I'm definitely feeling sparks with this one, though.  I mean, with version 4 -- I had a little bit of a thing with v1, and definitely saw promise in its DNA, but it wasn't until I met its younger brother that I started to swoon.  There's potential for magic here between AF4 and I.  I'll let you know how the honeymoon goes!<br><br>What really prompted me to write, though, was the discussion about H1N1.  I have been totally embracing the notion that mere handwashing should be enough, and so I went to research a little bit before posting something about that here. Much to my dismay, I found out that scientists are pretty sure H1N1 isn't transmitted by contact with contaminated surfaces.  That makes it even less likely that those wipes have any legitimacy behind their claims!  I am appalled by this revelation.<br><br>On the other hand (pun intended) I am completely convinced that handwashing still helps, if only indirectly:  it still is the best defense against many other viruses like the common cold or diarrhea, and if you don't have those sorts of things challenging your immune system, you'll naturally be more resilient to any other viral attackers that come along.  So keep up the handwashing!  And for H1N1, just try not to breathe around sick people. ;)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 September 2009 at 4:39 | Qrystal</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'll join in the offtopicness for the sake of everyone here:<br><br>I'd be more worried about the H1N1 vaccine than the actual Flu and associated hype.

I'm fairly sure it does not kill much of anything, but it does remove the oils on the skin and particles of crap are stuck to the skin that way are removed.  Not killed, necessarily, but removed.  I think if you are serious about hand washing you have to do it for a reasonable length of time, not a quick swipe under the faucet ... but 20-30 seconds of mindfulness ;-)  Special soaps are as good as anything else, and probably not much better ... just soap, water, and rubbing for long enough does the job.<br><br>The other factor is the things we touch.  Many markets have a wipe station by the carts at the enterance ... it pays to wipe those carts down a bit before using them.  Have you SEEN what people do with their hands?<br><br>Restroom door handles are another big thing, a shocking number of people don't wash afterward and then use the handle to leave.  This has nothing to do with H1N1, or even common flu, but e coli is nasty enough that you might want to avoid it.  The advice is to use the towel, after you wash, to open the door and then pitch it back in as you leave ... hit the trash can if you can, but as one advocate says, if you miss, and a pile accumulates on the floor, maybe the businesses will address the problem of unsanitary door knobs in rest rooms.<br><br>The other thing about hands is harder.  The way we get the organisms into our bodies is mostly through our eyes and noses.  It pays to try to become more aware and train ourselves to not touch our eyes and noses.  That way we cut down on one important pathway.<br><br>In Japan anyone who is sick and out in public and does NOT wear a mask is considered a social outcast.  We in the west, of course, take the opposite and far less effective approach of putting masks on healthy individuals and since that looks stupid, we don't actually do it at all.  But I suppose it probably helps when you have people around you coughing and spraying droplets into the air.  Yech.<br><br>As to vaccine, I am really going to get it this year.  I'm not of the chicken little camp and do believe that it is worth the risk if you are in one of the risk groups (health workers, over 50, weakened immune system, etc.)  Note that one needs to get it twice, once for normal flu, available now (in the U.S.) and one does for the H1N1 --- which has already begun to spread in (what is it? 26 states now) and will be available in a few days.<br><br>It is a personal decision, of course.  There is always a chicken little saying that the flu vaccine gives the flu and you'll die from it.  Well, you can die in your sleep, too.  Life is all about risk/reward calculations.  The little I've heard (from non hysteria web sites) is that the injection is slightly safer than the nasal spray ... it is killed virus where the nasal spray is weakened virus.  (I think I have it right.  Consult your doctor or do sensible research.  While I am not a fan of government information, I think the CDC is a good source for this kind of thing.  Here is the website for their info on the flu:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/http://www.cdc.gov/flu/">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/http://www.cdc.gov/flu/</a>  )<br><br>As for other measures that I am personally taking ... I'm staying away from the heard as much as possible this season.  I'm more aware of those near me and run from those who are coughing into the environment around them (i.e. near ME!)  I'm taking vitamins ... which probably have little effect except that they improve overall health.  And, of course diet, exercise, and enough sleep are always to be desired.<br><br>Good health to you all, and do a personal risk / reward calculation after getting information from serious sources.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 September 2009 at 11:19 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seemed to me it was the media hyping the swine flu that was playing the chicken little role.<br><br>Here are some good factual pages on the swine flu:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/04/29/Swine-Flu.aspx">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/04/29/Swine-Flu.aspx</a><br><br>and the swine flu vaccine:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://blogs.mercola.com/sites/vitalvotes/archive/2009/07/17/squalene-the-swine-flu-vaccines-dirty-little-secret-exposed.aspx">http://blogs.mercola.com/sites/vitalvotes/archive/2009/07/17/squalene-the-swine-flu-vaccines-dirty-little-secret-exposed.aspx</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 September 2009 at 20:31 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim,<br><br>I have no doubt that the public press is chicken little in this case.  OTOH, the virus exists and people do die from it.  Is it a public safety issue?  Who knows ... who cares!  I'm more concerned with my own personal survival so I make my own risk calculations.<br><br>As to that website.  Come on now.  That is one of those "natural healing" websites.  They have their own agenda and take on medicine.  If I want real information on disease I'll always go to the CDC, that's a no brainer.  And while I certainly think that the medical "establishment" has much to answer for by discouraging natural approaches to health, clearly, if there is a disease out there, most people really should get their information from the scientific community, not those selling vitamins for everything that ails you ;-)<br><br>I'm not about to take herbs when a virus is in the wind for the same reason I'm not going  to prayer meetings when I really need radiation therapy.

So what.  That means it is wide spread.  It happens to be more contagious than bird flu (H5N1) or the normal seasonal varieties.  But swine flu is much less severe or fatal in humans than the others.  There is now a vaccine, but it isn't yet widely available.<br><br>Seasonal flu varieties are fairly contagious, can be fairly serious or fatal and there are vaccines that are mostly effective.  In the US, there are usually about 30,000 fatalities each year from it.  It is often more serious in young and old and those who are otherwise unhealthy so they are the primary targets for vaccines.<br><br>Bird flu doesn't yet transfer from human to human; essentially it isn't contagious.  But it is the most deadly of the bunch.  It is worse for the middle age population for some reason; very young and old don't seem to be as susceptible.  There is no vaccine.  Once it becomes transmittable between humans, it will become a huge problem.  There is no vaccine yet.<br><br>Bottom line:  Do what you can to stay healthy.  If you are concerned about the flu, read everything you can and get the vaccines if  you choose to do so.  (Swine flu and seasonal flu vaccines are separate.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2009 at 12:35 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good Morning Mel,<br><br>Well, good evening now.

It is as good as any other, I'm sure.<br><br>&gt;&gt;  As for the CDC, medical science, etc., it would be nice if one could have faith in them. I don't. Financial and power incentives abound in government and science, too. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, that is true.  But the opposite of "There is a national epidemic." is not "There is no problem at all."  See, that is the insidiousness of the whole government/industrial complex.  Once you realize the sweeping corruptness of it all, there is a tendency to think that every word out of the mouth of anyone in that power block must be a lie.  But that works against our best interests.  What we need to understand is what the truth of any situation is.  To do that we must critically evaluate every bit of information we can get our minds on.  (Based on our level of interest, of course.)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  But neither do I have faith in Mercola.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>With the articles on, pardon me, cell phone radiation!  Please!  Get me my tinfoil hat ;-) ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  For me, it comes down to who you trust. I have a doctor I trust so his opinion is weighty for me. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I think knowing who to trust is important.  But more than that, I think trusting your own critical judgment is more important.  We can't all be virologists, but we can all gather opinion and filter it.  And, think about it, is that not our responsibility as human beings?  To learn and decide for ourselves?  I believer that deciding who to trust is the first step in gathering knowledge ... but only the first.  Questioning and testing information even from trusted sources is necessary.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I do believe that there are risks whenever our choices are motivated primarily by fear.   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I could not agree more.  Fear is deadly.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I can still remember New Years Eve 1999 standing at the top of hotel waiting for the lights to go out around me and life to end as I knew it. Sure glad I had my bottled water ready at home. lol  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>That really is a case in point.  As I'm sure you'll remember, computer programmers were behind the catastrophe.  LOL ;-)  Not exactly behind it, but a combination of technical limitations and lack of foresight on their part contributed to it.<br><br>In the beginning (waaaaay back ;-), we learned to jealously guard very byte of memory as we wrote our code.  The problem was that memory was so very expensive that there was very little available.  The IBM360 came in memory configurations from 8K to 524K!  I imagine that for a moment.  The largest commercially available computer had less memory than the computer you are using right now ... on your desk.  Less memory by a factor of almost TEN THOUSAND!<br><br>But with as little as 8K to cram the entire programs we were writing (and remember that the operating system also had to share that space) we needed to guard every byte.  So, naturally, we abbreviated dates to two digits ... of course, we could deal with any problems later (this was the early 1960's).  Also of course, that was the last time we thought about possible problems until some contrary thinkers in some back room somewhere realized the kinds of problems the change in the missing first two digits would cause.  (We contrarians are despised until we are needed to save everyone's bacon ;-) ;-)<br><br>But at the time, the problem was well understood, the fixes were known, and people were working on it for at least a few years before the turn of the century.  No disaster was looming.  People were making money selling newspapers, magazines, disaster parties, and probably tin foil hats ... but no one who knew what the problem was had any concern at all.  Sure, there would be some programs that would produce erroneous results.  But essential services would not be interrupted.  If a program shut off a valve in an oil refinery, someone would walk down a few flights of stairs and turn the valve by hand.  I understand the fear felt by those who did not understand the problem ... but the fear came from not understanding and not understanding came from not having the time or energy or interest to look into it more critically.  If anyone really thought that doom was approaching, they COULD have relieved their fear with the investment of a few hours of critical reading.  "Do you mean that they removed all of the manual valves when they put in the computerized controls?  Do they not have any manual overrides to perform maintenance?  How will the computer glitches really affect the garbage collection?  Water delivery?  How much of this is real and how much of it is hype to sell products?  How did our ancestors ever manage to survive without computers?"<br><br>In a way it is something like another recent discussion ... it is a question of how you respond to fear.  Getting more information to be more prepared is probably a good choice.  I suspect that most of the general public intuitively felt that the whole thing was overblown hype.  I think that the above questions I posed, while probably not asked explicitly, were in the subconscious of most people.<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;  I also remember being terrified to open my mail and seeing anthrax powder. My worrying didn't add a day to my life. :-)  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Strangely I never did worry about that.  I suppose, if you had asked me, I'd have said: "Who really wants to target me?  I mean, it has to cost a bit to get that stuff ... why waste it on me?  Am I really that big a problem for anyone?"<br><br>I'm watching, as I type, a Nova program on "killer asteroids".  Hey, there is nothing else on right now ;-)  Am I worried about killer asteroids?  Not in the least.  I can't do anything about it ... no one can do much.  Only a massive government program can do anything and I can't affect that.  Why worry about what you can't control?  I can't fully control the swine flu, but I can take SOME actions and I can take those without worrying about those actions I cannot take.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Your reminder to focus on good general health and hygiene is a good one. I would add to that to take care of mental health, too, which means recognizing that fear is far more likely to make one sick than prevent the flu.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I agree.  Worry never helps, unless it motivates creative thought aimed at an effective course of action.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2009 at 22:59 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, I agree with you. We do have a responsibility to educate ourselves. My concern is for those who cannot do so and are only fed what the media dishes out. Taming the Media Beast is one of the best books for understanding what drives media and it's very entertaining! Highly recommend it. Obviously, that's an aside. LOL<br><br>Killer asteroids...killer bees...killer virus...you'd almost think that we're all gonna die! Oh wait. We are. ;-) There isn't anything we can do to stop that. So I might as well start looking for a good ice cream recipe! <br><br>I was LOLing at your reasoning behind having no fear of anthrax. I had a case of inflated self-importance. Obviously! :-) As you know, fear usually has little to do with facts. The one fact that I am trying to live with is that I am not driving this bus. Even though I believe God is and you don't share that opinion, at least we agree that we aren't in control of the world. If we are, we have some s'plainin' to do. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 September 2009 at 23:25 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the book tip!  I'll check it out.  I wonder if it is available for the Kindel ;-)<br><br>Killer ... whatever ... LOL ;-)  That does seem to be the catch phrase to mobilize public fear.  It is really sad.  I like to watch the Science Channel, but even that is sensational now.  I wish there were programming available which stuck to facts ... or what we know ... without the continual drum rolls.  And yes, life is a fatal disease.  ;-)<br><br>So here's to strawberry ice cream ... even in winter ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 October 2009 at 0:53 | Mike</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
