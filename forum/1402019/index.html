I mean tasks of course but also project in the meaning of GTD and I treat them as well. There is only one exception, when i make a lot of calls I know people will call me back very soon. So I put it on a papersheet apart. But I could put it on C2 of my current page if they were very urgent or C1 at the next available page if they were not. <br><br>I also put ideas like think about this or some day do this or questions like ? do I have to do this ???? it help me to think about my aims. <br><br>Q:<br>How complete has the AFlist to be regarding upcoming tasks? Where are resonable borders? Keyword: three-fold nature of work (GTD). Do you work which shows up without putting it on the list?<br><br>Upcoming task are treated as new. ie on C1 except If they are urgent then they go on C2 of my current page. <br><br>Do the dished is not the problem I have a washing machine ! <br>Seriously, if a task has to be done on the flow i do it. I kept the GTD principle of doing things which can be treated in less than 2 mn if of course it's worth to do it, And After I go back to my SF list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 12:31 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jen, If you're the type to rush off to a phone call and forget to do the dishes, then yes it's necessary. Otherwise not. With SuperFocus, this system pushes you hard to finish things. Therefore I find it imperative to put all manner of easy stuff on the list as well. It keeps things going when I otherwise need a break.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 13:51 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jens:<br><br>It's entirely up to you what you put on your list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 21:33 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@ Alan yes indeed "this system pushes you hard to finish things"  today i did 4 page without 5 and dismissed a lot. It's even tiring because the system is so persuasive that it make you do the most important things the soonest possible and it's exhausting ! its a joke of course. As Mark said put what you want to put on your list if it helps you. For myself i don't think about that the system auto-regulates what must be.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2011 at 23:36 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Exhausting?

But it's still up to you to decide. It's quite possible to have good flow without recording meals. Or anything else you already deal with adequately. Some people designate times to ignore the list and focus on something else.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2011 at 13:36 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If the list is working for moving projects forward and completing tasks that otherwise build up psychological tension and cause stress when left undone, why fret over taking a break to vacuum some dust? The list is serving it's purpose.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2011 at 16:25 | OhNiners</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jens:<br><br>What I meant by saying it's up to you what you put on your list is that you need to experiment to find what works best for you. I put those meals on the list which I eat on my own, but not the ones I eat with my wife. I put doing the dishes on the list because otherwise I forget to do them.<br><br>Those are the ways I find work best for me. But others may find it works differently for them. That's ok.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2011 at 18:33 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with Mark. You put on your list whatever you feel should be on the list. I.e. whatever you feel you might neglect, forget or postpone otherwise. I definitely have dishes on there because otherwise they don't get done for weeks. But if dishes stand out naturally for you, then you don't need to put them on there since they will be done automatically.<br><br>One thing I do still wonder about is whether to put 'fun' stuff in there. Those items will happen whether I put them on my list or not, but putting them on the list may help me keep them at bay so that I *only* do them when they come up in my list. Unfortunately this seems to work better in theory than in practice so far...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 February 2011 at 21:41 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Tijl<br>I am in the same case. And there is some "fun" stuf that don't seem so fun once it is written as a task.<br>For example I was interested is a historic passage of Romania and I wanted to look on wikipedia and search the net about it so I put it on the list, but once become a task it doesn't look so fun and I don't really remember why I wanted to do this research in the first place. Well, because it looked interesting but it has no direct impact on any project that I do. You would say I should dismiss it but I am sure this is interesting so I will do it, but it won't be as fun as if I had done it immediately when I had the idea.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 February 2011 at 2:27 | isd</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
