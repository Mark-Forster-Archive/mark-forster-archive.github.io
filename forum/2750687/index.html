I'd love to receive any feedback/suggestions that might strengthen this process. <br><br>Tools: Paper or electronic<br>I use Apple Notes. Why? Mainly because Apple allows you to instantly create a note (or add/edit an old note) by tapping into the Notes app on your iPad with the Apple Pencil, right from the Lock screen! <br><br>Rules:<br>1. Write down something you're committed to doing - a want to do, or must do. <br>2. Do that thing.<br>3. If successful, follow rule #1<br>4. If other ideas pop up, create a branches of those things (see link/image below)<br>5. If you deviate from what you intended to do, create a broken line and start again. In the image (see below)  I committed to calling Sue, but instead went on Twitter. I draw a broken line, and enter something else I'm committed to doing, in this case "Go to Gym".<br><br>The goal and practice is to not violate the commitments you make to yourself. At the end of the day, you should have a general idea of what you accomplish, and where your head was at i.e. the more broken lines, the more distracted/anxious you were.  <br><br>Again, curious to hear what you would add/change to this workflow. <br><br>Link to image: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://imgur.com/a/2MlyTRX">http://imgur.com/a/2MlyTRX</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 October 2019 at 16:42 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum:<br><br>I'm having difficulty following your instructions. <br><br>First you write down "Call John" and do it immediately.<br><br>Then you write down "Buy Book" and do it immediately.<br><br>Then you write down "Facebook" and do it immediately.<br><br>Then you write down "Work on Book", "Call Sue" and "Call Mechanic" - but why does "Call Sue" get crossed out?<br><br>So you then presumably do "Work on Book" and "Call Mechanic". Or do you? I'm not clear about that.<br><br>Then you decide and fail to do "Call Sue" again and go to the gym instead.<br><br>I don't think I've got that right, but I can't follow what it should be.<br><br>---------------------------------<br><br>Why don't you just write down tasks in the order you intend to do them, and start again every time you fail to keep to them? That would encourage you to keep the list short, but give you some flexibility.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 October 2019 at 18:22 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;First you write down "Call John" and do it immediately&gt;&gt;<br><br>Actually, what I FIRST do is some form of a Scatter Map (Thanks Mark!)<br><br>But yes, according to the example provided, I was able to follow through on my personal intentions to “Call John”, “Buy book”, and surf Facebook. However, my next intention “Call Sue” was violated, hence the broken line. <br><br>&lt;&lt;Then you write down "Work on Book", "Call Sue" and "Call Mechanic" - but why does "Call Sue" get crossed out?&gt;&gt;<br><br>Good question! The 3 breakout items were things I thought of (along with Facebook). I committed to Facebook, but want to remember the other three items. By connecting them to “Facebook” via branches, it provides a bit of context about when I thought of these items, as well as any associations with the item I decided to work on. If the list was linear, that context would be lost. <br><br>In the end I did decide to do one of the three items “Call Sue” - versus something else entirely - and crossed out “Call Sue” as a visual reminder. <br><br>&lt;&lt;So you then presumably do "Work on Book" and "Call Mechanic". Or do you? I'm not clear about that.&gt;&gt;<br><br>No - those other items might be worked, or not. By jotting them down, it relaxes my mind, knowing that I’ve captured these items (see David Allen on capturing devices, etc). <br><br>&lt;&lt;Then you decide and fail to do "Call Sue" again and go to the gym instead.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Exactly. <br><br>&lt;&lt;Why don't you just write down tasks in the order you intend to do them&gt;&gt;<br><br>Perhaps it’s a shortcoming, or just a personal preference, but I prefer the freedom to choose IN THIS MOMENT what I want to do. This is why I have an aversion to Cal Newport’s style of Deep Work. It’s not that I think the process of pre-committing to a list of items (or a block of extended time) is in and of itself a problem, but it doesn’t work for me. <br><br>Thanks for commenting Mark. Discussing a productivity workflow with you would be akin to me jamming on a song with Jimmy Page - both of you have had a tremendous influence on my ability to noodle, albeit in different contexts.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 October 2019 at 19:02 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think you could achieve all the stated goals using the well established personal kanban approach instead, giving you freedom with focus and better avoiding the broken lines, rather than tracking them which feels like a waste of energy. In the example you gave I'd be inclined to group things loosely by function and focus on those (sort of like GTD contexts), ie get all your phonecalls done together where possible, and in that example probably on the commute to or from the gym.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 October 2019 at 23:39 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If this is really an anxiety issue, then looking into Twitter or Facebook to solve that is pointless.<br><br>From where I sit it sounds more like a novelty addiction problem.<br><br>Once per week is more than enough for Twitter or Facebook, specially for professional usage.<br><br>Anxiety is too general. Pin it down to what the real problem is. For example, if it's financial worry, get a "nest egg" to alleviate the anxiety. Let me guess, you have a hard time getting enough new clients? Improve your marketing.<br><br>If it's novelty addiction, have more meetings with real humans in the carbon based.<br><br>Choose intellectually stimulating projects that excite you more than "social" media.<br><br>If anxieties keep you from performing work tasks, forget about making it as an entrepreneur.<br><br><br>Harsh, I know. But I am rooting for you!<br><br><br>P.S.

Not looking for a new system or rules (should have been clearer about that), rather looking for suggestions on THIS workflow.

"Run 5K" is probably okay. "Gather running gear together" isn't.<br><br>I agree with Christopher's comments about social media. If you're hanging out there you're exposing yourself to everybody else's agenda and that's a black hole as far as you getting done what matters to you. Put it in your calendar to check once a week for 30 minutes and then don't look at it again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 October 2019 at 0:20 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum:<br><br>Ok, thanks for the explanation. I think I understand now.<br><br>The main problem I think I would find if I tried to work your system is that the "branches" would turn into yet another huge list of things to do - AND without any system to select from them. Your experience may vary.<br><br>In my first book "Get Everything Done" I describe an exercise in which one writes down what one is going to do next and then immediately does it. This is still an excellent method for increasing one's concentration and reducing "drift". But the whole point of it is that one DOESN'T have a back-up list of things to do. One relies purely on one's internal knowledge of what needs doing and one's readiness to do it.<br><br>Using this method your list would have read:<br><br>Call John<br>Buy Book<br>Facebook<br>Twitter<br>Go to Gym<br><br>By the end of the day, this would produce a very impressive list of what you did and achieved during that day. This could be used as a basis for reflection on how the day went and what you intend to get done the following day.<br><br>P.S. Having to write "Twitter" down before you do it has the effect of helping you to control Twitter usage (and other distractors) more effectively.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 October 2019 at 8:27 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark - I just finished rereading “Get Everything Done" last week. And the exercise you shared above most definitely influenced my aforementioned rules. And yes, your Twitter example is exactly why I write down each granular thing vs “Surf web”. <br><br>Thanks for sharing your thoughts.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 October 2019 at 11:22 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum/Mark<br><br>I've just skipped through "Get Everything Done" and can't see this exercise that Mark has mentioned. Could either of you be more specific about where it is in the book?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 October 2019 at 11:32 | Caibre65</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Caibre65: <br><br>Right at the beginning (I forget exactly where). It's the first exercise he suggests to build one's commitment capacity.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 October 2019 at 13:20 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been trying the system of writing down the next thing I'm going to do in a notebook.  My problem though is that I feed it from another list, so I still have the overwhelm of a lot of stuff that I'd still like to do.<br><br>The system of writing down the next thing you're going to do is very similar to instruction #2 in Time Surfing: Be aware of what you're doing and accept it.  The author writes "take a moment to realize that the task or activity you've chosen is you only task at the very moment...Fully accept every activity as your task for this moment.  All the while, remember to remain natural and flexible.  It shouldn't require any strength to focus your attention on the activity."  <br><br>The main difference between the two is that Mark recommends writing it down, whereas Time Surfing has you mentally note it.  He says to internally "name" the activity.  "I am making breakfast for my children".  Over time this will become unnecessary and you become more aware with without silently naming it inside your head.  <br><br>I think that the system of writing down what one is going to do next and then immediately doing it is in my top three favorite systems.  A couple of weaknesses to this system versus others I like:<br>- It doesn't seem to be as responsive to "little and often" as something like simple scanning.  I have to remember to do something often throughout the day and write it down.  For example, if I write "plank" or "push-ups" on simple scanning, I'll get it to it 4-5 times throughout the day.  Those little sessions add up over the weeks.  If I just write down what I'm going to do next, then I may only get to planking and push-ups once or twice a day.  <br>- I still feel some resistance to getting started on projects.<br>- I still need a list of some sort to remind me of the commitments I've made.<br><br>I've thought recently about redefining my relationship with my to-do list.  Usually I consult them often to decide what to do next, whether they be large or small, with some sort of scanning algorithm.  Has Mark ever suggested keeping a to-do list and then reading through it once, maybe twice a day to remind our subconscious of all the things we've committed to?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 October 2019 at 17:06 | Cameron</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cameron:<br><br>&lt;&lt; The system of writing down the next thing you're going to do is very similar to instruction #2 in Time Surfing &gt;&gt;<br><br>Indeed it is, though I wrote about it 13 years before the original Dutch edition of "Time Surfing" was published - just saying!<br><br>&lt;&lt; It doesn't seem to be as responsive to "little and often" as something like simple scanning. &gt;&gt;<br><br>You will find a simple system which overcomes this problem at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/6/1/the-system-im-going-to-be-using-for-this-experiment.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/6/1/the-system-im-going-to-be-using-for-this-experiment.html</a> . By coincidence it happens to be the system which I'm using at the moment.<br><br>&lt;&lt;  I still feel some resistance to getting started on projects. &gt;&gt;<br><br>The above system helps with this as you can apply "little and often" more easily. Just get the file out on the first pass.<br><br>&lt;&lt; I still need a list of some sort to remind me of the commitments I've made. &gt;&gt;<br><br>The best way to do this (if using this system) is to schedule them in your reminder system..<br><br>&lt;&lt; Has Mark ever suggested keeping a to-do list and then reading through it once, maybe twice a day to remind our subconscious of all the things we've committed to? &gt;&gt;<br><br>I can't remember if I've ever written about it, but I've certainly tried it.
