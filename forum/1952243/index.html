This is more geared for online. just enter a    :<br><br>and will make into outline title.<br><br>i wish there was a way to move between projects.<br><br>feels like some basic functionality we expect is missing, but then other abilities never seen are there.

By using lots of tags within Evernote, I had most of that sorting power, but I didn't have to decide what was a "context" vs. an "area" vs. a "project" and such.<br><br>And that at any time, I can just sort all tasks by date modified and be back in pure Final Version mode.<br><br>So, I think Asana struck me as both too structured in the same was as zendone, and, strangely, not structured enough to draw me and make me see the value of the structure.<br><br>Whew, long answer.

Quick feedback<br><br>- it's still "green" - the UI is still confusing or more exactly assumes some prior training (and still, it never feels elegant or pleasing - it feels like a good toolbox, a efficient professional tool, not something that can make you smile)<br><br>- the focus is on structure and collaboration. Their vision is to bridge the gap between Enterprise software (one version of the truth, but not what people use day to day, hence reconciliations issues) and email.notepad.excel (what people use, but creates a mess in communication). As such it's quite the opposite of what Mark has been looking for: a "system" so elegant and powerful that I should prefer to go to my AF or FV list for the fun of it rather than checking cnn.com or facebook<br><br>- once you spend a full two days looking at the on line videos and trying to make it work, it is actually VERY powerful. The comments section of each task allow to track progress, do two minutes to advance something, note the outcome, and move on ; it's really a platform with a lot of potential, and a good project management tool  -- just keep in mind that this is probably overkill to just create and manage a list (despite their video that says the opposite and recommend to just create a flat list to assign task to yourself automatically: sure,  but what's the point of learning a structuring tool and not using it?)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 October 2012 at 21:27 | PJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello, Thanks for asana. I tried. I found it nice when you have a team and you need to collaborate. It is free until 30 people so that's great ;-) <br>For the software it self I found it usual. Nothing revolutionary, just a collector of projects and tasks. No diary, well nothing new...<br><br>I rather prefer something simpler such as an AF/FV list which is more efficient for me as I work on my own. Anyway thank you it was interesting to have a look at it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 October 2012 at 13:44 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use Evernote for FV (thank you Avrum!) and that covers the vast majority of my needs. But I am finding that for some projects that have a number of moving parts, the note body in Evernote is not adequate for keeping track of what I have already done and what remains to be done.<br><br>I am sure that I could create tags or notebooks in EN to organize my projects, but this is a case where I would just prefer to use software that is designed for managing projects.<br><br>For many years I have been using a desktop application called Achieve Planner and I have always been very happy with it. It was more than adequate for any kind of project planning. But, nowadays, with EN and dropbox and all my other tools and resources being accessible on the cloud, I decided to look for some kind of project planning software on the cloud.<br><br>I tried Trello, but never could get it to work in a satisfactory manner for the projects I have. I loved workflowy's intuitive clean interface, but it didn't have any way to link to files or URLs. I have to have that in some kind of project planning app.<br><br>So, that leaves Asana. Asana is very team-focused and I am using it as a lone individual. Much of the information in my project plans refers to tasks that others have to do, but I don't expect anyone else to use my project plan.<br><br>So far, Asana is working well. It doesn't have a very sophisticated way to create task dependencies, but I can live with what it does have.<br><br>Now, what I do is create a task in FV with the project name. In the body of the EN note there is a link to the Asana project plan. I can still make notes in the EN note, but the heavy lifting of project planning is done in Asana. I've been doing this for a few days and it is working well so far. <br><br>Yesterday I was out of my office and checked Asana on my phone. It was very helpful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2012 at 14:00 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just came across this thread by chance.

A bit of a learning curve and continue to find bugs.  All and all we are happy, but Asana could use some improvement.  Some common sense options could be added and moved around to streamline things.   Honestly, I would wait to buy until they work things out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 July 2013 at 18:19 | Jason</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have used asana and found it's user interface quite boring and also many of the important features are missing.

So much awesome material. This is a topic I started in 2012. I don't use Asana, do check in on them occasionally. One recent feature of note, they have added a Trello style kanban board, if anyone into those. Thanks for everyone for contributions and continue to contribute. And of course for Mark for making this all exist.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 June 2017 at 16:16 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been using Asana for a couple of years.<br><br>It's pretty flexible once you understand the thinking behind it. The two killer features are the extensive collaboration options and the ability to have a task genuinely in multiple projects at once.<br><br>I found this GTD-related video helpful in figuring out other tricks to make it even more flexible: https://asana.com/guide/resources/customer-interviews/tracking-organization/springest<br><br>Because Asana allows you to specify your own manual task sorting (if you want), it works quite well electronically with most of Mark's systems. You can treat the "New Tasks", "Today", "Upcoming", "Later" sections as different types of tasks/pages for different systems.<br><br>For example, if you are doing something like AF4 then you can use "New Tasks" as the open list and "Upcoming" as the closed list. The four sections operate slightly differently in how tasks are added - a task added to "New Tasks" will go straight to the bottom of the list (ideal for AF4). "Later" lets you get recurring/future tasks out of the way of your lists and lets them automatically reappear on the due date.<br><br>I don't find Asana that useful for a system like GTD, I prefer MyLifeOrganized for that but, alas, MLO still lacks decent collaboration features and, these days, that's becoming more and more important even if it's just to collaborate with your "significant other".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 June 2017 at 9:19 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My squad used Asana software for years, but then we decided to get one more Playstation 4 to the office and we were not able to pay subscription fee.
