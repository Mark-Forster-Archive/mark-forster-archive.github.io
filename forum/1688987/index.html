Use a page-a-day diary or journal book. <br><br>2. Draw a vertical line down the middle of the page.<br><br>3. The left side of the page is your "maybe" list.  <br><br>4. The right side of the page is your "hot list".<br><br>5. When you start the day, you would normally have many items on today's "maybe" list, and nothing on the "hot list".<br><br>6. Process by cycling through all the items on today's page -- both the "maybe" list and the (growing) "hotlist".  Work on anything that stands out.  <br>     ○ If you take action, and complete the item -- just cross it off.  <br>     ○ If the item needs more attention (either recurring or unfinished), then re-enter the item on today's "hot list" list.   <br>     ○ However, if the item needs to be re-entered but is "done for today", you can enter it on the *next* day's "maybe" list.   <br>     ○ In cases where you really can't take any more action for several days (for example, you sent off an email and expect 2-3 days to get a reply; or it's a recurring item and you don't need to see the task again for a week), then re-enter the item as many days ahead as needed -- on that day's "maybe" list.<br><br>7. When nothing else stands out on today's page, then you can scan forward through future pages, taking action on anything that stands out.  Follow the same re-entry rules for unfinished items as above.<br><br>8. After going through the future pages, go back to the oldest page in your book that still has active tasks.  Treat these pages just like AF1 pages -- i.e., if you take no action on a visit to a page, all remaining items are dismissed.<br><br>9. After completing an old page (either by taking action on something, or by dismissing that page), you have the option of moving forward to the next old AF1 page, OR jumping directly forward to today's page.  Use the same re-entry rules for these old AF1 pages as you do for the today page.<br><br>10. Today's page cannot be dismissed -- it's like the last page in an AF1 notebook.<br><br>11. The normal, default place to put new things is on TOMORROW's "maybe" list.<br>     ○ However, if a new item is urgent and needs attention today, put it on today's hot list.<br>     ○ If a new item cannot be started till the future, then put it on the future date's maybe list.  Don't abuse this -- if you defer items to the future merely because tomorrow is already looking full, I have a feeling the system will break.<br><br>12. At the end of the day, move whatever you want from today's hotlist to tomorrow's maybe list.   Leave everything else on the page alone.  Then you are done for the day.  (Ahhh, what a nice feeling!)<br><br>13. If you like, at the beginning of the day, you can take a quick scan or two through today's maybe list, and put a dot or a circle or other mark next to the items you think are probably "hot" for today.   Or, you can just rely entirely on the standing out process.  Whichever you prefer.<br>	<br><br>This seems pretty similar to what I posted earlier.  Here are some additional observations:<br><br>1. The explanation of the rules is vastly simplified.<br><br>2. There are a lot fewer choices to make.  Unactioned items typically remain where they are; thus, there isn't the reliance on "negative standing out" to decide when to "move a task somewhere else".  <br><br>3. It does not include project pages -- though these could be included pretty easily by using blank pages at the beginning or end of the notebook.<br><br>4. The focus of one's work tends to be on today's hotlist.<br><br>5. Splitting the list into "Maybe" and "Hotlist" seems to make a key difference vs DIT or DIT+(AF1 on old pages).  The "Maybe" stuff is merely a list of tasks for your consideration - there is no implied commitment, until you take some action on it and move it to the hotlist.  This would seem to create a lot more freedom and sense of flow.<br>	<br>Alternate approach to dismissal:  You could use DWM-style dismissal -- anything over 30 days old is dismissed automatically.   <br>	<br>Caveat:  I haven't tried any of this yet -- I just wanted to capture this brainstorm before I go to bed.  I will try it tomorrow, if I can wrangle these ideas into a OneNote structure.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2012 at 5:01 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gosh!

But, I do keep coming back to the idea of Today's list. There have been times when I would cull some key tasks from DWM2 and place them on a separate "today" list to work on them. I also like the idea of legitimately moving certain tasks to a future date (within the system rather than outside the system) to heed to the time-based context explicitly. <br><br>I tried TODAY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY setup but I couldn't sustain it after sometime and I went back to DWM2. Now, I have been trying your method for the last 2 days and I really like it. <br><br>However, I have added a few wrinkles. I have added the timed dismissal aspect of DWM2 - both for the unactioned items (30 day dismissal as you mention) as well as the actioned items (7 day dismissal). Obviously my testing timeframe is not sufficient to see how this works out. But, I feel comfortable that the DWM2 timed dismissal (which i have found to work for me well) will translate well here. I mark all actioned items so any items in the DATED lists with a mark that is 7 days old gets dismissed. While there is an element of compulsion with this dismissal, I have adopted it because it has worked for me before. Also, it might eliminate the stragglers that bounce around and linger on (as Mark mentioned in the earlier thread). This type of dismissal I feel can coexist with AF1 type dismissal. I will experiment with this for the next few weeks.<br><br>I also have decided to move any tasks left behind in TODAY at the end of the day to DATED close list, instead of moving them to NEW. Once an item moves to TODAY, it means that it has been committed. If the commitment continues to be there, then the task will move to FUTURE pages. If the commitment has dwindled, then it makes sense to move it to a DATED page. I am not sure how the dynamic plays out compared to your method of moving them to NEW page.<br><br>BTW, I also use Onenote for this system and I do have iPhone version for mobility. I use the mobile version primarily as read only list and add any new item into it when I am not near the pc. Right now the pages unfortunately cannot move in the mobile version which would make it more versatile.<br><br>So far I have really liked the flow of this system and I have been able to get a lot done. I have a clear picture of what I am doing "today" and it gives me a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. <br><br>GC</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2012 at 6:30 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>so Monday ( named DAY) pages are gone, however as "page-a-day diary" that is OK<br>what about March (named MONTH), would you suggest put on March 1st?<br><br>as I commented earlier, I liked the ability to get a big picture view of the year with the Month pages</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2012 at 10:05 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Greenchutney wrote:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Does this mean that you may keep a NEW page around till it gets "filled up"?

My hope was to share something that worked well for me --maybe someone else would benefit from it -- but also to get feedback that might help me improve the weak spots.   And I got that feedback very quickly, especially from you and Alan.<br><br>That resulted in the Revision 2 rewrite, which is mostly just a clarification of Revision 1, with a few ambiguities clarified, but not really a whole new system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2012 at 16:18 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>matthewS wrote:<br><br>&lt;&lt; so Monday ( named DAY) pages are gone, however as "page-a-day diary" that is OK<br>what about March (named MONTH), would you suggest put on March 1st? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, that's what I would be doing if I were actually using a notebook instead of OneNote.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; as I commented earlier, I liked the ability to get a big picture view of the year with the Month pages &gt;&gt;<br><br>Some diaries / journals have a "month view" page at the beginning of every month.

I think pages are like SF1 column 1.  Although they are dated, there is no expectation to do all those things on those dates.

This would become a chronic issue and clog up the system, if you are frequently overflowing to the next day like this.   And I don't see a way to limit it via the mechanics of the system.  You could "audit your commitments" to try to reduce the incoming tasks, but that's not automatic enough for my tastes.<br><br>Thus, I think it'd be preferable to get a notebook with bigger pages, or something along those lines, so you ensure you can cram all your tasks onto the one page for that day.<br><br><br> &lt;&lt; or are items on todays maybe list, tomorrows, or January 8ths list items you really hope to touch that day? &gt;&gt;<br><br>No, I don't necessarily expect to touch all the items that day.  The point is that I want the items I don't touch to become "AF1" pages that get cycled for awhile and then dismissed if no action is taken.   Overflowing to future pages both clogs up the future pages (making them less responsive to current needs), and it also defers the cycling/dismissal process.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2012 at 19:47 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; The constant cycling has been such an important key -- frequent repeated exposure to all my outstanding work, allowing tasks to percolate till they are ready, or till it becomes clear they are no longer relevant. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Which is of course one of the key principles of AF1.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2012 at 20:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; your systems are a lot more elegant . . . than mine &gt;&gt;<br><br>Elegance is usually the result of going for the simplest possible answer to a problem.<br><br>For example, if you thought hard about how you could make your system as simple as possible, you might realize that you can achieve exactly the same effect without making any changes at all to the rules of AF1.

My own hard thinking doesn't appear to be up to the task, however, which is why I've started these threads.  :-)<br><br>Regarding the "unspecified something", the first thing that comes to mind is the number of items per page.  I suppose you might mean that you can define this as "close the last page at the end of the day".  But simply doing that would not give you the ability to differentiate between items you want to see again today, items you want to defer to the future, and items you don't really care when you see next.  <br><br>Perhaps you referred to the tickler system for items that must wait till some future date to be started, which AF1 leaves unspecified.   You could consider the future pages as just another tickler system.   But even so, this still does not create the equivalence of AutoDIT's focus on TODAY, the ability to know when a day's work is complete, etc.<br><br>Maybe you mean something else -- anyone else have any ideas?<br><br>I see the key difference between AF1 and AutoDIT as being AutoDIT's multiple entry points:<br><br>- With AutoDIT, new urgent items are entered directly onto today's hotlist.  AF1 does not handle urgent items in any special way, and this is the main weakness of AF1.<br><br>- AutoDIT provides future pages for entry of items that cannot start until some future date.  AF1 offloads these items to an unspecified tickler system.  <br><br>- AutoDIT provides at least two entry points for re-entry of unfinished items after you take some action on them.

The weakness you refer to was a weakness in my perception of the system, not in the system itself. My perception has now changed - thanks to studying your system!<br><br>&lt;&lt; AutoDIT provides future pages for entry of items that cannot start until some future date.

This would be an actual rule change.<br><br>	- Incorporate the TOMORROW page and all the other future pages as your tickler system -- which isn't specified in the AF1 rules.<br>	<br>You can also count the "maybe" list and the "hot" list as really just one list.   When you start the day, everything will be on the maybe list.  As you process things, the items that see some action can move to the hotlist.   This can be simplified.  When you start the day, just draw a line under the items that are on the list so far.   Add any new items below the line.  Also, re-enter items you want to see today, below the line.   The line itself isn't even necessary - it's just a useful visual clue to show you activity that occurred after the start of the day, and it has a parallel in DIT.<br><br>Looking at it this way, AutoDIT really is just a variant of AF1 with a variable page length and a built-in tickler system.   AF1 already allows you to move an item, after you've taken some action, either to the last page (which would be the TODAY page), or to the Tickler system.   The TOMORROW page is really just part of the Tickler system.<br><br><br>But now, looking at Mark's latest comments, this isn't what he had in mind - there's something else that he has in mind that makes this exactly AF1 if you specify something that wasn't specified.

I was always finding lots of things to do on page 10.  After a few days, I might actually arrive at page 15 (while entering new items on page 21), and still find plenty of things to do, especially because now whatever items were still current, were pressing and urgent because I had taken so long to get to them.    <br><br>This always being behind, was a self-perpetuating problem.   If I was processing page 10, and new items were going onto page 15, it was abundantly clear that I might not get back to page 10 again for a very long time.    So, I'd better do whatever needs doing on page 10 NOW.   So I'd spend more time there than I might if I had confidence I could actually come back to that page pretty soon again.<br><br>Sometimes I would just jump ahead to the last page so I could stay current, but after a few days, I'd fall behind again.   (This is obviously breaking the rules, unless you count this as a kind of "if something needs doing now, just do it!!")<br><br>Sometimes I would mass-dismiss several pages in a row, the very first time I came to them, because there were many items on the last page I *had* to get working on *now*.

Some of it is still interesting or fresh and "stands out".   But for much of it I have the feeling, "What was I thinking?  Why is this even here?"   A lot of it gets dismissed.   And then I'm back to my TODAY page, refreshed after a short break, an hour or two at the very most, doing something a little different.   <br><br>I'm still puzzling how to achieve that same effect just using AF1's rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2012 at 3:54 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark Forster wrote:<br><br>&lt;&lt; The "unspecified something" is within the system as it stands - something within the rules which is not specified (though I must admit I was quite surprised to find that it wasn't!) &gt;&gt;<br><br>I was thinking it might be "What do I want to complete today?"  or  "How do I know when I've completed my day's work?"

I will enter new items at the end of the list -- not into the tickler.  I'll try that for a couple days at least, and test Mark's theory that my AutoDIT approach is identical to (AF1 + start at the page which contains the first entry of the day before).<br><br>(2) If I feel that I am not achieving the TODAY effect that I was getting with AutoDIT, then I'll invoke the AF1 rule that anything that can't be started till the future should go into the tickler, and also make a command decision that I don't want to start ANYTHING NEW until tomorrow.  Thus everything new goes into the tickler for tomorrow.  I think a case could be made that this is still pure AF1, just an unusual approach to using the tickler.  I'll try that for a couple days at least, and see if it improves.<br><br>(3) If I am still missing the TODAY effect even after that, then I may introduce something like the TODAY Maybe List and the TODAY Hotlist, to separate the active hot tasks from the rest of the stuff on the today list.   This would now be breaking away from AF1 and getting closer to the AutoDIT rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2012 at 20:00 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>I do not pretend to be a productivity guru, but I'd say that if your system is working for you then just keep using it.  Call it 'hogwarts system' or whatever you want. If you're experimenting for the fun of it, then proceed.  If you're making these changes because you feel inadequate, then please DON'T.  No one can/should tell you that the way you've found amenable to getting your work done is inferior to another system.  That's productivity snobbery and it's anything but productive.<br><br>Frankly, your 'autodit' or whatever it's called makes perfect sense and could be a great system in and of itself.  Call it 'Seraphim's Hotlist System'.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.<br><br>brett</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2012 at 20:24 | brettypooh</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;A key advantage is that it is a CLOSED list -- closed to new items, that is, in the same sense that DIT's daily list is a closed list. There are exceptions -- urgent items that must be done today -- but those really don't require much mental effort to identify. I really like watching my TODAY list get smaller as the day progresses.&gt;&gt;<br><br>It appears we're actually going in very different directions.  I'm watching my TODAY list get larger as the day progresses, until days'-end when the list shrinks back to zero.  This is quite surprising since the superficial understanding seemed to have us working the same direction!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2012 at 21:28 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>brettypooh - <br><br>Thanks for your comments.   Actually, I do like to keep improving my systems -- I find it enjoyable for its own sake, but also need some reliable way to handle my workload.   <br><br>The whole reason I posted my system to the discussion forum was to get feedback to see if anyone had ideas that could fix some of the weak spots.   It turned into quite an interesting discussion!<br><br>So, I am happy to keep looking for something better, and to do some experimentation toward that end.   I don't really feel inadequate.  I don't look to Mark as to a guru, but I really do appreciate his insights and feedback because they have always been so helpful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2012 at 21:35 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan - At this point I'm finding it hard to keep track of what we are comparing.   I think the AutoDIT rules, as I originally posted them, and also as posted at the top of this thread, are pretty close to what you had started doing independently.   But this thread has taken several turns and twists, and I've mentioned a few other variations, and Mark has mentioned some as well, and now I am actively testing something very different (though Mark claims it is nearly identical in the end).   So I'm feeling a bit lost.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2012 at 21:37 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>The danger that I mentioned is quite rare. I think it happens when I have a few big tasks and work on them little-and-often for a few days. The result is I get stuck at the more recent end of the list, and need to remind myself to cycle the list properly. Productivity doesn't suffer, it is just some old things on the list that get older than I would like. A quick whiz round the entire list soon sorts things out. I think this was an issue with AF4, too. Or was it AF2? I can't remember.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2012 at 21:41 | Wooba</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>Just to be clear, I was not referring to mark at all in my post, or to anyone else in particular.  but I do know what it's like to be told your system is adequate even when it's working for you. I experienced this when I was a corporate trainer for David Allen company for a very brief period of time.<br>Like you I'm always tinkering and that's part of what makes it fun.  A large part of the reason I keep coming to this site is the quality of responses you get here.  <br><br>Anyway, best wishes.
