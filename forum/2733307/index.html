It has given me a constant sense of being focused on the right things. Using the method gives me a sense of calm and order.<br><br>-- It's also probably given me the fastest responsiveness to new things -- a responsiveness I've been able to sustain for several weeks. This is more than any system I've ever used. I've always had bursts of productivity when starting a new system, but after a short time it would level out, or run into conflicts, and the productivity would drop. With this method, the responsiveness and productivity has just gradually been increasing. <br><br>-- A 72-page journal is just about perfect for a full month of work. Each page has 24 lines. Most days, I enter about 25-35 tasks. I've never exceeded a single two-page spread on a single day. I usually complete 50% to 80% of the tasks the same day they are entered. <br><br>-- It's relatively rare to re-enter unfinished tasks. I usually end the day with less than 5 tasks on the page that were crossed out and re-entered. Usually it's the same 1-2 tasks. I'm not really sure why there are so few re-entries. I think I tend to stick with things longer till they are done.<br><br>-- Old pages with outstanding tasks typically hang around for about a week, give or take. They tend to be interesting / engaging to read. There are always a few things that got done without referring to those pages, so I just cross them out. The remaining tasks tend to be good fodder for thought &amp; engagement -- for longer-term thinking. Just reading through them feels worthwhile, even if I don't do anything with them at the moment.<br><br>-- Sometimes I run across an older task that pops out at me, "OH NO! I'd better get that done right away!" As I read through the older pages, if there are too many entries like this, it starts to feel like a backlog of debt -- it starts to create anxiety and pressure. If I can't take action on them right now (for one reason or another), it seems to help just to take two or three of those tasks and copy them to my current (today's) page so they will get more attention. That alone seems to relieve the sense of debt. Often those tasks get handled right away. And strangely enough, sometimes they get handled by being deleted! I haven't been able to make any sense of the dynamics here. Why was it bothering me so much, only for me to realize it didn't need done at all?<br><br><br><br>Just like with no-list, this method seems automatically to guide me to establishing better routines. But that effect seems to be amplified. I really don’t understand how it happens. For example: <br>-- I've moved many of my daily routine tasks from the beginning of the day to the end of the day. This seems to improve my ability to focus on the main work of the day. It also tends to reduce the time spent on those routine tasks. <br><br>-- I used to check high-priority email all through the day (from key colleagues, etc.). I changed it to checking ALL unread email through the day -- for example, when changing tasks, or after a break -- and then whatever doesn't get handled immediately, gets handled at end of day. Somehow this has dramatically reduced the time I spend on email, increased my overall responsiveness, and my total inbox size seems to be much smaller. I was surprised by how this worked out. I thought it might be faster and more responsive, but also more distracting, and wasn't sure it was a good idea. But knowing I will process all email thoroughly at end of day gives me the freedom to READ the new email immediately but not have to DECIDE or ACT on it till later. This almost eliminates the sense of distraction -- it seems to arise from reading the email but not knowing how to get closure on it, so I can't let it go. Now, it's easy to let it go. I know I'll see it at end of day. And by then, I've already subconsciously worked out what to do with it. At least, that's how it seems to be happening.<br><br>-- My weekly routine has improved - mainly deciding which days to go into the office, and which days to work from home. Again, I am not really sure how this happened. It just DID. I wasn't making a conscious effort about it.<br><br>-- My moments of downtime are much better spent. Let's say I'm waiting for a meeting to start, I have 3 minutes. I used to pull out my phone and check up on whatever, or do some web surfing, which in retrospect was almost a complete waste of time and gave me a headache. Instead, I've been pulling out my notebook more often, and reading through the old tasks, which makes me think, and get engaged, and motivated, and sparks new thoughts, and, OH it's time for the meeting to start. It's becoming more and more of a routine to pull out the notebook instead of the phone. It's a much better break, it leaves me energized, not brain-numbed. In past, with long-list systems, I would sometimes have the same experience, but it was equally likely to leave me with a sense of overwhelm and stress at how much stuff wasn't getting done -- which would create resistance to the system -- and prompt me to go to my phone on breaks for relief.<br><br><br><br>Here are some questions I still have:<br>-- I've always had a strong intuition for systems and the "big picture". This method works very well with such a mindset. I wonder how it would work with people who don't have a naturally strong bent for systems thinking. I'm guessing that everyone has strong intuition for the totality of their world, their full context, even if they aren't "systems thinkers", and this method will only strengthen that natural intuition. So maybe it would work for everyone. But I just don't know. Everyone has their own strengths and temperament. <br><br>-- Do I really need the list at all? I wonder if this method approximates the natural behavior of so many people who are able to get so much done, and so much of the RIGHT STUFF done, without any identifiable system at all. When I do go "off list", I actually don't feel like I am doing anything differently. And especially, I don't feel like I am "cheating". It just feels like a natural extension of whatever I was doing on-list.<br><br>-- Sometimes I've been tempted to switch to a dated annual journal. I used a Moleskine daily journal for most of last year, and it was nice to have all my notes and things with me all the time, from the whole year. I also liked to enter reminders on future pages. I might give this a try. I wonder if it would change the dynamics to start sometimes with tasks already written on the page, instead of starting with a blank page. I wonder if I could get used to carrying it around all the time.<br><br>-- I wonder if those tasks that hang around for a week or two and occasionally create that niggling sense of anxiety will eventually cause this method to crash and burn. I think another month or two of trialing this method should be able to tell. This is my biggest worry about the system right now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2019 at 5:36 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A few of you have been trialing this method as well. Any observations?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2019 at 5:38 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I wasn't trying to use this method, but as my Day Page captures more and more of my attention, my Long List is fading away (even though I cleared my desk so they are visible side by side), and my system is collapsing into yours! With your description in mind, I recently gave in and allowed items to stay uncrossed-out on earlier pages.<br><br>Except, with the Steno pad I am using and the day's schedule filling the left column, I only have 22 half-width lines for the task list, so I am always minimizing what I write there. I tend to do little/routine things right away without writing them down, but I am haphazard at it. This is making me want to run my daily routine from a check list, a single card with checkboxes for each day of the week, and drop the Long List. I'd reprint the card each week or use one of those mini dry erase ideas from <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2733008">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2733008</a> .<br><br>As for email, I'm going the opposite direction: from checking it constantly to just 2 or 3 a day, which is what I used to do. Somehow it got out of hand. My daily checklist would list the individual email checks separately, to make this plan visually clear and remind me how many I've already done.<br><br>I am interested in David C's "4x2" and nuntym's "TT," but I don't think they'll get a good trial as long as I am using my Day Page, which I do not want to give up.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2019 at 7:33 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have not been on this so long.  So far I have no complaints but also no particular praise, as I am still trying to get into a flow of regularly doing this. I guess a remarkable thing about this is that the list does not feel stale despite intermittent use. Or maybe not so remarkable as I recently cleaned it.

I use a little notebook ( https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/signature-sketchbook-notebook ) which has 24 lines. I start a new spread each day, which gives me the left-hand page and the right-hand page for a total of 48 lines. This has proven completely adequate. Most days use the full left-hand page and a bit of the right-hand page. It is important to be able to see it all in one glance.<br><br><br>I was tempted to use checklists for routine tasks, but resisted the temptation, for a few reasons:<br><br>(1) As soon as I started writing down the checklist, it started to feel like debt. Worse, it started to feel like a DAILY debt. I hated that feeling.<br><br>(2) It also felt like it would interfere with the natural propensity of No-List to allow these routines to emerge and develop naturally. I *love* this characteristic of No-List. I can't say I really understand how it works -- but it is wonderful, and I was afraid the checklist would interfere with it.  Too much conscious planning (what I "ought" to be doing each day), not enough organic emergence (following intuition).<br><br>(3) The last time I used checklists, the checklist started dominating my day. I don't want to give recurring tasks so much emphasis. <br><br><br>Regarding email -- I don't actually check it constantly. Probably once every 30 or 45 minutes -- for example, after a meeting ends, or after I finish a stretch of work on a single task, or after returning from a break. It's a quick check-in, before I return to my no-list. It typically takes me 2-3 minutes to deal with the unread emails that have arrived. Maybe 5 minutes, if there's an email or two that need immediate response. It keeps me aware and responsive. Emails that need a longer response are saved till the end of the day &lt;&lt; that's the key to it. I don't worry about them any more. I know I will take care of them same-day, or at least next-day if my end-of-day routine is cut short.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; I am interested in David C's "4x2" and nuntym's "TT," &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, so am I. I've been watching both of those threads -- they've both given me many new insights in one way or another. Very interesting stuff.<br><br>RE 4x2 -- I am afraid it's got too much structure, and I would start to resist it. The serial no-list seems to have its own kind of structured procrastination, anyway. <br><br>RE TT -- It just seems too complicated for me. Serial No-List is just so simple and seems to give similar benefits. <br><br>Maybe "complicated" isn't the right word. I just don't like having to distinguish between "urgent" and "non-urgent". Everything just goes on the list in the same place. The list is so short, it is easy to process it even when these things are mixed together. <br><br>It might not give the same diagnostic insights as keeping the items separated, but I am not sure that matters. I suppose the purpose of the diagnostic insights is to improve one's process and steer one's intuition in a better direction. But with No-List, I find that this happens automatically.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2019 at 18:39 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>I have had all those same troubles with checklists too. In fact, I made a preliminary one last night and have already started not wanting to use it! I'd really like to make a project called "Stay Up To Date" or something that contains all this sort of stuff and run it like any other kind of project. Somehow that always turns into a second list that I don't look at often enough, whereas other projects work fine in their own separate organizational space. I guess the topic Stay Up To Date is not focused enough.<br><br>Mark's idea of dotting the Urgent/Unfinished tasks could inject Serial No-List with some TT flavor. I remember an AF1 variation where we tried this. I agree that it's a burden to categorize every new task as it is written down and to have to decide how Urgent it needs to be to get dotted, but at least the Unfinished ones could get dotted without any friction as they are rewritten, and it will keep all work in progress highly visible. An open circle might be better than a dot, since we are accustomed to our prior meaning of dots. You can then dot the open circle when you select its task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 2:34 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; Mark's idea of dotting the Urgent/Unfinished tasks could inject Serial No-List with some TT flavor… at least the Unfinished ones could get dotted without any friction as they are rewritten, and it will keep all work in progress highly visible. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I haven't tried this, but I don’t think it's necessary with Serial No-List. The current page is where all the action happens, and it takes about 15 seconds to scan the whole thing. And it only takes a couple minutes to scan the previous pages. So it's already easy enough to maintain a sense for which items are unfinished and which haven't been started. The two kinds of tasks have a very different feel -- at least in my experience. Also, the unstarted tasks tend to stay behind on the older pages, unless they keep popping up in my mind when I start up the new daily page. These dynamics are enough to keep me focused on the right things.<br><br>So I am guessing adding a special symbol to unfinished tasks would only get in the way of one's intuition -- as well as creating extra overhead.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 14:43 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find (after 2 days) that forcing myself to think whether it's really valuable enough to go on the my short list for the day helps. I used to put it there by default (it feels safer) where it would gum up the works. I rather like seeing only what I need to do, and seeing the entire list finished by day's end. It also makes the things I didn't do stand out more.<br><br>As I said in the other thread, having both Urgent and Non-Urgent on the same page, but separate lists, might just be the sweet spot. It's physically and emotionally easy to put on the Non-Urgent list and keep the short list short.<br><br>Checklists and Pre-populated Pages<br><br>I started the year by printing booklets (a week's worth of day pages, a month's worth of week pages, a half-year's worth of month pages) and pre-populating them with routines. I'm resisting them a lot! I'm back to blank pages. There's something about rewriting tasks that helps. Maybe the little bit of wiggle room. Maybe it's knowing that I can change the routine without reprinting the booklets. Maybe the act of writing while planning the day. Maybe the routine of saying "Be Ba K Li La G O D" every day. Probably a bit of everything.<br><br>In theory, checklists (and grids) are better. Faster to create, less rewriting, easier to see patterns. In reality? I'm not enjoying them. Also, if I don't update them daily, or chose do do something more valuable than daily routines, they look like I've failed.<br><br>Recurring<br><br>I've started flagging recurring (and unfinished and LAO -- they're very similar) rather than immediately writing them on the next day. I lose the benefit of seeing what order I actually did them in, but gain the benefits of always writing them in the same order, which reinforces routines. (Even if I don't do them in exactly the same order each day, saying them in the same order groups them.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2019 at 16:52 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Be Ba K Li La G O D" <br><br>Beryllium Barium Potassium Lithium Latium Germanium (?)

There’s a long chapter in Eli Goldratt’s book, The Goal, that talks about Mendeleyev and his discovery of the Periodic Table. The key thing is, he was not imposing an order from “outside”. He was *revealing* an intrinsic order that already exists. This is the key. There is a real order to things, a real cause-and-effect, even in such complex and nuanced things as factories, supply chains, retail stores, project management - and time management. <br><br>Theory of Constraints is all about discovering and revealing this intrinsic order. We often discover it first through intuition but have a very hard time articulating it clearly. Goldratt’s genius was being able to systematically combine emotion, intuition, and logic to reveal, clarify, and validate the intrinsic order in the complex situations we face every day, with all their conflicts and ambiguity - and then use this knowledge to break the conflicts and get better and better results that never before seemed possible. <br><br>I think Mark’s systems are very similar - they leverage our emotion and intuition to help us discover the intrinsic order that already exists in all the demands on our time we face every day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 February 2019 at 2:10 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sounds fascinating, but I wonder if there's much new in it for me. I'm already very familiar with constraints for physical processes. Dad will say it's from him. (I'm a third generation engineer.) I think, though, it was Mom who actually taught me, back when I was 12 and she saw that the complicated meal I'd planned would not work the way I planned to do it. She made me write out cutting and cooking times and temps. It totally changed the order I did things in, and I changed one dish so we only needed one oven temperature. I talked at least one over-optimistic foreman through the process at work. An hour of welding can't start until the welder is free, and it takes time to bring the casting over.

I use the concepts from the book all the time, both at work and in personal life. They've taken my natural intuition for systems to a much higher level.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; I even watch the process at fast-food restaurants to see the bottlenecks. Resource management games suck me in. &gt;&gt;<br><br>LOL, I do the same thing. I think you would really like this book.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2019 at 1:08 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cricket - <br>&lt;&lt; I still need to work on conflicting desires. Why am I not making progress on my larger projects? How do I tell when playing a game is a good break or taking time from other things? How to balance social media so I get the benefits but not the lost time and emotional drain? &gt;&gt;<br><br>It's interesting that you mention this in the context of finding system constraints. This is exactly how Theory of Constraints (TOC) approaches general problem solving.<br><br>The basic idea is that when you have a lot of different undesirable effects, there are only a few underlying causes behind it all. Generally there is some kind of vicious cycle -- negative effects with a reinforcing feedback loop. And the reason the vicious cycle persists is some underlying conflict that is unresolved. Resolving the conflict breaks the vicious cycle, and all the undesirable effects are eliminated or at least reduced.<br><br>So the key is to find the underlying core conflict behind all the different undesirable effects. This is the "constraint" that governs the behavior of the whole system and causes the problems to persist.<br><br>If efforts are directed somewhere else, they will have little effect. It's treating the symptoms instead of the cause. Just like fixing some part of a mechanical system that isn't the constraint of the system. It will give only a small improvement at best, and may cause problems in other parts of the system.<br><br><br>One very effective approach is to look at any three undesirable effects. Choose three big ones. Identify the conflict behind each one. Then combine those three conflicts into a single, integrated conflict. This reveals the core conflict behind many of the issues you are facing. It is probably having other far-reaching effects in your work and life.<br><br>There is a very common conflict between "security" and "satisfaction". We want to be happy. In order to be happy, we need to be secure -- protected against threats, have the basic minimum needs fulfilled. Also in order to be happy, we need to be satisfied -- to reach our aspirations, to find deeper freedom and fulfillment. But in order to be secure, we need to protect against risks and changes, while in order to be satisfied, we need to accept risk and embrace change. This is a fundamental conflict. <br><br>Different people tend to default to different sides of this conflict, developing either risk-averse behaviors that frustrate our larger potential, or risk-prone behaviors that create a lot of fragility in our lives. By looking deeply at the assumptions that cause the conflict to persist, we can remove the conflict and achieve both security and satisfaction. <br><br>There's a great paper written on this by Efrat Goldratt -- Eli Goldratt's daughter.

Most of it is familiar to me, since I was often the young person brought in to bring in a new program and given advice by everyone, or the young person everyone gave advice to when change happened, but it isn't usually presented in one place.

The last two weeks were somewhat chaotic such that I did not stick to the script the whole time, but I have definitely done so this weekend.  The list remains pleasant to work with, and although there are a handful of items remaining which are many weeks old I'm happy with where it's at.<br><br>My current medium is linear and digital, and finished tasks and days are completely hidden so there is not a long ways to scroll up, less than 2 screens full in fact.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2019 at 0:24 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think one of the reasons it works so well is that whenever I pickup the list to work, I get to put whatever I wish done on it, and therefore it's always showing what I want to see.

What I really liked about DIT is that it gives me a very good feel for my day-to-day workload. But I could never keep it up to more than a few days in a row. I'm trying your Serial No-List, and what I miss about it is the option to postpone something to tomorrow. I was wondering if you have experience with how the dynamics of DIT compare to the dynamics of Serial No-List.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2019 at 10:16 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nicole - <br><br>&lt;&lt; Seraphim, did you ever use Do-It-Tomorrow? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, I used it for maybe six months, immediately before Mark introduced AF1, and have returned to it several times over the years. I've probably spent more time using DIT than any other time management system.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; What I really liked about DIT is that it gives me a very good feel for my day-to-day workload. But I could never keep it up to more than a few days in a row. &gt;&gt;<br><br>That was my experience also. It would work very well until I would have a series of overloaded or meeting-heavy days. It was often difficult to recover fully after that. <br><br>Those circumstances always created a backlog. And by DIT’s rules, if you have a backlog, you should make it your Current Initiative to clear out the backlog. But at the same time, the series of overwhelming days was usually the result of some new focus or new change in direction. And *that* needed Current-Initiative-level attention as well. This always seemed to create a conflict that needed sorting out before I could really move forward -- often triggering an Audit of Commitments. In other words, it was always disruptive and time-consuming, and happened often enough to be really troublesome.<br><br>Serial No-List is more free-form. A daily routine or order does seem to emerge and evolve -- more on that below. It doesn't feel quite as satisfying as DIT's daily cadence and feeling of completeness, but then again, perhaps that sense of completion was just an illusion, since it was so hard to sustain. Serial No-List does much better at handling those disruptions to the daily routine. It's proven much more sustainable for me.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; I'm trying your Serial No-List, and what I miss about it is the option to postpone something to tomorrow. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I know what you mean. Sometimes I have been tempted to pre-load a new page for the next day. In the end, I just started writing those things in today’s page, together with whatever else comes up during the course of the day. That almost always works just fine. The items is parked there till it "stands out" during one of my occasional back-scans of the older pages.<br><br>But sometimes, the item keeps niggling at me after I write it down. It's usually because I am worried that when tomorrow arrives, I may be absorbed in tomorrow's work and never backscan today's page and see the task. If it niggles at me like that, then I just create a reminder for it in Outlook.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; I was wondering if you have experience with how the dynamics of DIT compare to the dynamics of Serial No-List. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, I've thought about this sometimes.<br><br>For me, Serial No-List has more sense of structure and completeness than FVP or No-List, but less than DIT.<br><br>Every time I have used DIT, it seems to give the same particular kind of structure and cadence to the day. I really like that feeling of relaxed, focused, reliable cadence (though it never seems to last...).  <br><br>Serial No-List tends to give a structure to the day, too. But it evolves (and seems to improve) over time. For example, at first I was starting each day by opening my notebook and writing down whatever was on my mind. After a time, I gradually shifted to starting each day looking over my calendar and scanning for urgent emails -- and only then moving to my notebook. It seemed to help give more context to the day and alert me to any urgent things I may have forgotten about (such as early-morning meetings). But this prompted me to develop a better system for reminding me of early-morning meetings, and also helped me realize that none of the unread emails are ever so urgent as to require attention immediately at start of day. So those things stopped bothering me, and I went back to something more like DIT -- starting each day with my notebook, and tending to start actual activity with whatever "Current Initiative" needs focus. <br><br>Sometimes Serial No-List seems to hit a "sweet spot" that can last for a few days or weeks -- it gets into a nice cadence. But then something about my routine starts to niggle at me -- something isn't working quite right -- and Serial No-List forces me to address it. That can be a little disruptive to the satisfying sense of cadence and flow, but eventually a new "sweet spot" emerges that's even better than the previous one. <br><br>But to be honest, sometimes that "sweet spot" can be elusive. I've been going through that recently, dealing with health issues again and some changes at work. The thing I've realized is that the disruption is not so much some artifact of the system, but just a reflection of whatever is actually happening in my life right now. This helps me to address the life and work issues more directly, rather than looking for a way to tweak Serial No-List to fix it. The system itself is fine, it just reflects reality back at you and makes you deal with it. <br><br><br>Another area of contrast is recurring items. With DIT, I found that the Daily Tasks part of the Will-Do list tended to collect a lot of recurring items that didn't *really* need to be done every day -- but it REALLY FELT GOOD to do them every day anyway. It gave me a feeling of calm and control to know I was always on top of all those things. But in the end, the pleasure of checking off all those tasks every day would take my attention away from my Current Initiative and one-off tasks. <br><br>With Serial No-List, the recurring tasks seem to take care of themselves more automatically. And the ones that don't, keep showing up on my list, bothering me, until I figure out a workable system to handle them automatically. This seems to free up more mental space for dealing with the stuff that requires more focused attention and creativity.<br><br>Hm, there are probably more differences but those are the ones that immediately come to mind.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2019 at 5:56 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the elaborate and insightful reply!
