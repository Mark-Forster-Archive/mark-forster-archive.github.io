Will that be true in a week? Who knows?<br><br>So far, so good on your Autofocus V.4 thinking. It looks fascinating, Mark.<br><br>I just discovered your ideas from a post on the GQueues discussion form.<br><br>GQueues is an online list app that's integrated with Google Calendar. Like most, it supports collaboration, etc.<br><br>There's a very functional free version and a paid version for those people who need just a bit more.<br><br>Anyway, I'm not affiliated with them -- I use the free version, but the developer is awesomely responsive, seems like a great guy, and I'll upgrade in a heartbeat if and when the free version doesn't do everything want it to do.<br><br>Which it does.<br><br>I believe GQueues can overcome a lot of the shortcomings with using electronic lists Mark Foster enunciates... if you implement it as I'm going to illustrate. Let me describe it and tell me if it makes sense to you.<br><br>= = = =<br>Before I do, here's the benefit: Best of paper, best of electronic. (Call that a tease!)<br>= = = =<br><br>1) I created a Queue (a.k.a. list) entitled "Autofocus V.4."<br><br>2) I added outstanding items to it.<br><br>3) At the bottom of this list, I added this:<br><br>XXXX --- Dividing Line Between Closed and Open Lists --- XXXX<br><br>4) Any new items are added at the bottom by default. This is perfect. It's where they should be.<br><br>5) When finishing a recurring item, or working on a task as far as you want to with more yet to do, you can "duplicate item".<br><br>6) This adds it to the bottom of the list in the open section. You can then reword the item if necessary and go back up to the closed list and check the item off.<br><br>7) This causes the item to disappear keeping the closed list neat and tidy. For that matter, same thing with the open list.<br><br>As an aside, GQueues has awesome keyboard shortcuts and is really quick to use once you figure it out. Up and down arrows become the equivalent of a pen or finger pointer. It's also got a bunch of Ajax-y drag-n-drop goodness. And no, I really don't work for them. I just like it.<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://GQueues.com/">http://GQueues.com/</a><br><br>8) Once the closed list items are all done, dropped, or re-added to the open list; duplicate the XX -- Dividing Line -- XX and it will appear exactly where it should: at the bottom. Delete the original dividing line.<br><br>9) But let's say you're travelling for a few days and may not have constant mobile access. No worries. Print the darn list in its entirety! You'll start with a completely clean list and sure, it'll become a standard mess highlighted, crossed-out paper-and-ink list before long.<br><br>Outstanding.<br><br>Either throw it in a duotang notebook or, my preference, attach a small binder clip to the top left with a few extra blank pages thrown in (lined if you care: I don't) and, "voila"! You now have an instant paper-based system.<br><br>More...<br><br>GQueues also has the ability to create tasks with deadlines (recurring or one-off). So those things that must be done on a given day, give them deadlines.<br><br>You can keep a separate "Tickler" Queue of routines, committments, etc., or you could just assign a deadline to any item within your Autofocus V.4 Queue -- either way.<br><br>GQueues allows you to create Smart Queues based on selected criteria (due dates, tags, Queue-Categories, parent Queue, etc.) and designate any Queue you wish as the default Queue when you load the program.<br><br>So I'd suggest you create a Smart Queue with any item due today as well as (this is important) overdue items.<br><br>Make these the your default Queue.<br><br>Do these due-today-and-overdue items because they must be done on a given day (just don't go crazy designating every task as due on specific days -- use it judiciously!).<br><br>***Then go to your AutoFocus V.4 Queue*** and work the system as Mark teaches.<br><br>If for any reason you don't complete one of your due-dated items on a given day, oh well. It will show up as due tomorrow. You won't lose it.<br><br>And you can print that list too when travelling.<br><br>Further, GQueues automatically comes with a Google Calendar gadget for those who use GCal. This lets you see any items with due dates within the next week.<br><br>If you want even tighter integration, upgrade for $25/year (volume discounts available) and these due-dated items can appear directly on your Google Calendar and you can make changes to them directly from GCal itself. Upgrading allows you to assign tasks to others too.<br><br>Neither of these are important to me. Your mileage may vary.<br><br>Finally you can add new tasks via a browser bookmarklet (which lets you decide which Queue to put it into), email, instant messaging.<br><br>I think Autofocus and GQueues will work VERY well together.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>P.S. I had an idea so simple I can't imagine Mark Forster would disagree with it (okay, I can imagine it, but nonetheless he should hear me out). You can process anything "list-like" using Autofocus rules. So, I have an in-tray that has 5 levels on it.<br><br>Outbox<br>Inbox<br>Act (What you call  the"Closed" or "Backlog" list)<br>Bide (What you call the "Open" or "Active" list<br>Delegated<br><br>Using Autofocus V.4 rules, I simply go through anything I've put in Act... over and over again... until there's nothing else.I can or want to do. Then I go through Bide once. Then I go through Act again per Autofocus rules.<br><br>Finally, when there's nothing else I will do in Act, I chuck it in my recycle bin for eventual shredding... or, rarely, do throw it in Bide to get through later.<br><br>Then take everything in Bide, throw it up to Act, and you're off to the races again.<br><br>The dividing line between the "Act" and "Bide" trays becomes the "Dividing Line" Mark Forster talks about and demonstrates.<br><br>This same method would work for, say, 2 web browser folders "Act" and "Bide" containing website URLs (where you don't feel like writing them out by hand -- ALTHOUGH GQueues has an easy way of doing this with its bookmarklet), 2 email folders "Act" and "Bide", even My Documents folders so designated.<br><br>You may not need all of these, but the point is the Autofocus principles should work beautifully applied to any you do need.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 May 2010 at 20:47 | Christoph Dollis</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for pointing out GQueues - I hadn't come across it before.  It seems simple to use, and I like the Google Calendar applet.<br><br>At the moment I'm back to using AF1, and although I'll continue to run it on paper, I think this will be a good way of longer-term planning, ie generating tasks that will eventually end up on the AF list.  I haven't quite decided how yet, but I can see possibilities.<br><br>Thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2010 at 10:27 | Annette</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christoph,<br><br>Interesting description.<br><br>Can you send me a copy of the application as an attachment to rhj1947ATgmail.com please?<br><br>I'm in the second month of a thirteen month assignment in Damascus, Syria, some US-based outfits won't allow any logging onto their site due to US sanctions.<br><br>BTW, I'm a Brit/Saffer expat here, home address is in the UK!<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Roger J</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2010 at 10:52 | RogerJ</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's a web application, Roger, built on the Google application framework.
