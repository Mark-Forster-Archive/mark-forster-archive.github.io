(I've no idea if they really are or not). Or possibly you might discover the exact tension that is required on a spring to trip a mousetrap for an adult mouse.

We often make propositional statements and declare them to be "true" without having a clear idea of what such an assertion even means.  Such a statement presupposes an actual correspondence between the statement and its analog in the "real world".  However, such presuppositions often fail to acknowledge that the statement is the product of a semiotic system of language with an ambiguous relationship to the "real world".  The problem is compounded when different people do not agree on the meaning of words -- in other words, they propose (or assume) a variant correspondence between the statement and the reality it is intended to represent.<br><br>This problem would seem to be diminished in mathematics, in comparison to natural human language.  However, it is still a fundamentally intractable problem, as demonstrated by Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.   The theorem proves that any arithmetic system is either "complete" (describing fully the underlying reality), or consistent (i.e., not self-contradictory).  It CANNOT be both.   <br><br>In other words, if an arithmetical semiotic system is consistent, it cannot be complete.   <br><br>And if such a system is complete, it cannot be consistent - it must be self-contradictory.<br><br>This is quite a conundrum, because it proves that mathematics cannot completely describe the reality of numbers and their properties.   It does not merely suggest this conclusion, but proves it.   It also proves that any arithmetic formal system that claims to be complete must necessarily be self-contradictory.<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems</a><br><br>This theorem has been extended to formal systems, semiotics, and science in general (Tarski's undefinability theorem):  a complete 'unified field theory' or "description of everything" will necessarily be self-contradictory.

If by the term "mathematics" we mean the semiotic system that attempts to describe the reality of numbers and their properties, then I would say it is an invention - perhaps an invention with uniquely interesting properties, but an invention nonetheless.   But if we mean the underlying objective reality itself, and our ability to understand some of its properties, then I would say it is a discovery.   It is very difficult (impossible?) to separate the two ideas:  so I would agree with Alan, that it involves both.

I value mathematicians and theorists who keep making more accurate theories (we'd not be past the Industrial Revolution without them), and enjoy learning them (well, back when I could actually do basic partial differential equations), but working engineers are more concerned with staying within the limits of the models than expanding them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2014 at 16:03 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>From the article ( <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derek-abbott/is-mathematics-invented-o_b_3895622.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derek-abbott/is-mathematics-invented-o_b_3895622.html</a> )<br><br>&lt;quote&gt;<br>Amongst mathematicians and scientists there is no consensus on this fascinating question. The various types of responses to Einstein's conundrum include:<br><br>1) Math is innate. The reason mathematics is the natural language of science, is that the universe is underpinned by the same order. The structures of mathematics are intrinsic to nature. Moreover, if the universe disappeared tomorrow, our eternal mathematical truths would still exist. It is up to us to discover mathematics and its workings--this will then assist us in building models that will give us predictive power and understanding of the physical phenomena we seek to control. This rather romantic position is what I loosely call mathematical Platonism.<br><br>2) Math is a human construct. The only reason mathematics is admirably suited describing the physical world is that we invented it to do just that. It is a product of the human mind and we make mathematics up as we go along to suit our purposes. If the universe disappeared, there would be no mathematics in the same way that there would be no football, tennis, chess or any other set of rules with relational structures that we contrived. Mathematics is not discovered, it is invented. This is the non-Platonist position.<br><br>3) Math is not so successful. Those that marvel at the ubiquity of mathematical applications have perhaps been seduced by an overstatement of their successes. Analytical mathematical equations only approximately describe the real world, and even then only describe a limited subset of all the phenomena around us. We tend to focus on those physical problems for which we find a way to apply mathematics, so overemphasis on these successes is a form of "cherry picking." This is the realist position.<br><br>4) Keep calm and carry on. What matters is that mathematics produces results. Save the hot air for philosophers. This is called the "shut up and calculate" position.<br><br>&lt;/quote&gt;<br><br><br>Sounds like you are in category #4, Cricket.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2014 at 22:17 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; So: back to the original question.

Chess itself is an invention: the pieces, the board, &amp; crucially the arbitrary rules that govern play. There are 10^120 possible games of Chess. However, all playable games of Chess are potentially contained in the basic parameters and rules of the game. Therefore each new move, tactic, &amp; strategy could be said to be ‘discovery’, rather than ‘invention’, within the game.<br><br>It could be argued that Mathematics is an 'invention' because the entire construct is a formal system, created by human intellect. It is not 'discovered' in the way that a physical law like gravitation is: by observation, induction, hypothesis formation, &amp; empirical testing.<br><br>However, I would argue that Mathematics involves more discovery than invention.<br><br>First: Mathematics &amp; Logic both involve discovering the underlying mechanisms of their respective but related disciplines, i.e. a priori principles &amp; formal systems, built on: <br><br> (i) fundamental concepts such as number, space, logic etc;<br> (ii) axioms &amp; postulates<br> (iii) controlled &amp; formal rules of inference, manipulation &amp; derivation that ensure that inferences made within the system are valid and that truth is maintained; <br> (iv) symbolic notation.<br><br>Second: new mathematical principles, propositions, theorems etc. are derived by deductive inference within the systems, or additions/modifications to the system. In principle, these truths &amp; derivations are intrinsically present within the formal system, and thus it could argued that mathematics is a 'discovery' process because it involves extrapolating from them.<br><br>I'd argue therefore that Mathematics is more 'discovery' than 'invention'.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2014 at 11:21 | James Precious</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One could argue that there is no difference between a discovery and an invention, since the word "invention" comes from the Latin "invenire" which means, you've guessed it, "to discover".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2014 at 17:02 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is exactly why the question as originally posed is a good test for clear thinking.  To get clarity here, the first step is to define what is meant by all three terms - mathematics, invention, and discovery.   There are many hidden assumptions in the way people interpret all three terms.<br><br>In my last post, I tried to elucidate what I mean by "mathematics" but didn't go into what I mean by "invention" and "discovery".   Perhaps the way the Huffington article frames the discussion is more useful:  "math is a human construct" (invention) vs. "math is innate" (discovery).  But perhaps not.   Different people may think about these questions in different ways.   I think that's why it's so hard to arrive at consensus and clarity.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2014 at 17:22 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Different people may think about these questions in different ways.

Some argue that God invented truth, including math, and all we do is discover the rules God established. Finding a patent at the patent office is merely discovering another's invention.<br><br>In the end, there is as you suggested earlier very little difference between the words.  To invent something is generally a process of trying various ideas with an object of discovering an idea that works for your purpose.  And if in the process you accidentally discover something useful in another way, you might file your discovery at the patent office as your new invention.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2014 at 19:20 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Some argue that God invented truth, including math, and all we do is discover the rules God established. &gt;&gt;<br><br>But others would argue that the universe works perfectly well without using mathematics.
