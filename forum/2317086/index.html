( <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/</a> ).<br><br>I can't find the exact quote, but it was essentially something like this:   Maybe a person can figure out how to live with all the notifications and reminders and constant flow of new information:  you can find a way to make it useful.   But there is still a deep risk.   It's easy to develop a habit, whenever facing boredom or frustration or pain, to quickly turn to an easy escape, an easy distraction.   This habit can prevent a person from going deeper, from dealing with the underlying causes of the boredom, frustration, and pain.   Ultimately it can shut off the ability to go deep at all:  always living in the mental shallows.   <br><br>Whenever I read about concerns that people are constantly distracted and technology is to blame, it just seems silly to me:  it is so easy to just turn off the notifications and put the person back in control.   But when the problem is framed as an ubiquitous, easy escape valve, I can really relate to that.   Escapism as a habit has been with us for millenia but never in quite such an ubiquitous form.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2014 at 0:11 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Coincidentally I was listening to an interview with Aldous Huxley from 56 years ago where he warned of such things  as limitations to our freedoms.

The patient wants to be the type of person who keeps up with all these blogs, all these subjects, all these friends. He wants to be the type who can manage the firehose of information. (I've followed MedExpress for several months. Very informative, seeing how many studies contradict each other, and how the press takes a study done on 10 mice and declares a problem solved. I recommend it for anyone who tries to change their habits based on the latest study, or wonders why their doctor doesn't agree with the press.) On the other hand, I'm not sure if there's anything more I can learn from it.<br><br>There's also the "I'm important" part. Work or friends might need me! And being part of the loop. If you aren't available, you might not hear the latest important information (or gossip).<br><br>When Sesame Street first came out, they said it would create what we now call ADD. It was short segments and fast-paced. There's a balance between accepting that kids in the target age learn best that way, and encouraging them to focus for longer. Back when I watched it, the segments were related. There were letters and a number of the day. Skits dealt with similar topics. There was a story, complete with problem and solution, that covered the entire week. It also encouraged returning to the project again and again, with short relief tasks.<br><br>Yes, I seem to be living in the mental shallows these days. Not sure if it's age or technology. I'm not able to think in as many layers as I used to, or maybe I've just forgotten how to put some layers on hold.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2014 at 15:51 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I heard that the same Google makes very stupid.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 September 2020 at 13:53 | Mitra</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's unfair to point exclusively at Google in this instance.  It's all technology together.  The article claims it takes 3 days to feel unplugged and the benefits.  I think I want to try that over a long weekend.  Turn off all devices on Friday, and don't touch them until Tuesday.  I don't think that will work the same as escaping society entirely for 3 days (which I have done many times, not recently), but it's an interesting experiment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 September 2020 at 15:51 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I found myself getting addicted to my phone.  I forced myself to make it dumb.  I deleted all apps except the ones Apple wouldn't let me.  Then I added back only those that are essential: my calendar, and my list app (Workflowy)—these are pinned to the bottom with phone and texting.  I then added back some basic tracking apps—a driving tracker for an auto insurance discount, a GPS tracker so my wife and I know where each other is, for safety, and maps.  I put all of these other apps and the ones Apple won't let me delete into a sub-folder called "can't delete" located on the next swipe page over.  So now my home screen is completely blank except for the four apps at the bottom, and the next page over has one subfolder with a few apps.  I also turned my phone black and white so that it is less attractive to use.<br><br>All other apps that I use are on my iPad.  If I need an app, I am forced to go get the iPad, but it doesn't follow me everywhere, so it's not constantly available.  It's been wonderful.  I don't have Google on my phone, nor Youtube, nor social media, nor music, nor anything else.  Is it inconvenient at times.  The tradeoff is that I give up some convenience, and gain several hours of my life back each week.  <br><br>I've considered buying a Light Phone 2.  Interesting concept.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 September 2020 at 16:32 | Cameron</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There a documentary (with some drama segments) called “The Social Dilemma” on Netflix that talks about this subject. I have also read similar books such as “Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked” by Adam Alter, and one that describes techniques similar to what Cameron did, “Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World“ by Cal Newport (same author as “Deep Work” which is about the value of focusing on something for a large block of time within a day). <br><br>The interview subjects in The Social Dilemma, who are engineers who worked at the companies trying to manipulate your attention, have some concrete suggestions at the end such as disabling the notifications, and for things like YouTube: blocking the recommendations. Even they, knowing how the manipulation works, have problems falling prey to it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2020 at 14:45 | Don R</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
