So two things are needed:<br>1. Record the thought before it escapes you. <br>2.

You can also, of course, write on it.  <br>So, I put some pertinent info in the quadrants of a folded-up blank piece of paper and use that.

I was referring to those little bittly notebooks  just for capture purposes.  They don't take up any room in your front pocket even.  <br>The second point is that I agree with you; a small notebook SHOULD work as a  capture device.  It's just that when I see it laying on the counter I never look into it because I am afraid of all the stuff I have probably scribbled into it.<br>Also, folded blank pieces of paper in my pocket wouldn't work, either.  They just look like rubbish when I get home. That's why I liked the Toodledo booklets because they were "attractive" and inviting to look at.  <br>I could never use a small notebook as a "task mangagment system" unless I get into Zen or something and simplified my life tremendously. <br>Anyway, we all got to use whatever works for us, because quick-capture is an invaluable tool sometimes, isn't it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 September 2011 at 17:15 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Coincidently, I just got a Space Pen (black matte bullet) a few weeks ago and was quite positively surprised by the build quality. I'm really enjoying it… <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/0JxG7JNNnKs">http://youtu.be/0JxG7JNNnKs</a><br><br>But you don't need to buy an actual space pen to try it out: the "secret"[1] is in the pressurised refill, which comes with a little plastic "adapter" to work with normal "click-type" pens. So you can buy only the refill and try it out with your current preferred pen (I also bought one refill because I prefer the "fine" version over the "medium" it comes with and it's working great in my old pen). <br><br>[1] under water, zero gravity, upside down, non smudging… all essential stuff in regular office activities these days ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 September 2011 at 19:29 | Hugo Ferreira</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+JMJ+<br><br>@Mark: Fine, your pen's better.  And good goodness, Mark, us comparing pen size? That sounds... &gt;__&lt;<br><br>@BKK: &lt;&lt;First of all, I was not referring to a notebook that is intended to have a use, i.e., using the ideas of a free-form notebook. I was referring to those little bittly notebooks just for capture purposes.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, my notebook is as small as what you are describing, considering it's just 3"x5" in size.<br><br>&lt;&lt;It's just that when I see it laying on the counter I never look into it because I am afraid of all the stuff I have probably scribbled into it.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes I would agree! But the solution, at least in my experience, is to be forced to use the notebook, like for example making it my task management system.  Which is the reason why it is always with me, and I always use it.  I always get amused when people tell me I'm like a boy scout when I fish my notebook out of a pocket anytime I need to record something.<br><br>&lt;&lt;I could never use a small notebook as a "task mangagment system" unless I get into Zen or something and simplified my life tremendously. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Just try it, it might surprise you.  And before you say a regular AF system will not fit into the small notebook, please note that when you open up a fliptop memo notebook, the open two pages become a "virtual page" with anywhere between 25-35 lines, perfect for AF1 ^___^<br><br>@Hugo: &lt;&lt;[1] under water, zero gravity, upside down, non smudging… all essential stuff in regular office activities these days ;-) &gt;&gt;<br><br>Definitely!

I'd have thought he would have jumped at the chance of using an even more compact pen.<br><br>And finally the point about a small notebook is that you capture thoughts which you then transfer to your main system as soon as you get back in the office. So there should be no reason to resist looking at it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 September 2011 at 23:11 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+JMJ+<br><br>@Mark: Goodness gracious, no, I am not objecting! But reading again what I typed before, maybe I was a bit standoffish; that wasn't my intention, Mark, sorry.  But basically I am really, truly delighted with my Zebra Telescopic pen right now so I am not looking for another currently.  I mean, isn't it cool to have a pen that can change its length at whim?  But the Space Pen IS in my possible wishlist when I get tired of my current pen.<br><br>Although, couldn't ordinary ballpens still be used in wet conditions, and can be used upside down for a very limited amount of time?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 September 2011 at 2:26 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan Baljeu wrote:<br>&lt;&lt; An AF list is a great capture tool.

It sounds so simple, like Mark's statement above, "transfer to your main system as soon as you get back in the office. So there should be no reason to resist looking at it."  <br><br>I guess what I was doing concerning the capture thing was admitting yet another weakness (resistance) I have with basic principles.  I realise this "laziness" factor could cause something very important to fall through the cracks.<br><br>It's funny, you mentioned that people tell you you're like a boy scout when you fish out your notebook.  Just an example to note how different animals "we" are from others:  Yesterday my usual BKK buddies (British, Canadian, American) came over to fetch me and nobody could even BELIEVE I wanted to carry a simple pen in my pocket (much less a 'Space Pen').  They could not fathom the idea of why I would ever need to a pen at the restaurant or at the pub.  These people would never use any list more involved than a shopping list, if that.  Hard to knock it, because they seem to get on just fine, but it is amazing just how different we all are.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 September 2011 at 5:49 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been using OneNote for universal capture.   <br><br>I've set it up so that new OneNote items appear on the last page of my OneNote-based AF List.<br><br>If I want to write down a task or idea that occurs to me, it's one click  (Windows-N) to open a new note, write down whatever I want, and I'm done.
