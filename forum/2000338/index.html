Well, nearly ALL of the book has been really useful.   <br><br>For awhile I was processing my daily Will Do list with the FV algorithm, because it wasn't really a Will Do list.   Now that I'm getting better at crafting a real Will Do list, I find it's easier just to go straight down the list, skipping things only if the context or timing isn't quite right.   <br><br>The Current Initiative idea has really helped me with focusing on the larger, critical projects that I must move forward.<br><br>I could go on and on about how this has been helping me get things in better order, more focused, with better results.<br><br>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts Avrum!<br><br>Can you post a few links to some of the "gold" you found in those years of Mark's posts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 November 2012 at 18:27 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;Can you post a few links to some of the "gold" you found in those years of Mark's posts?<br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Let's put it this way...

This is an (emotional) big deal because I'm been posting/following Mark's work since 2008, but never read any of his books. Also, a year of hacking my own systems has taught me something: the advantages of creating my own system(s) buckle under the same factors that led to their creation i.e. constant improvement, novelty, creating my own forms, etc. As the year comes to a close, it's exciting to give myself over to rules and procedures conceived by one of my productivity heroes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2012 at 17:02 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just a warning, DIT is not laid out in an algorithmic way quite so definitively as AF or FV etc.   It took me a week or two to get into a rhythm with it -- unlike AF or FV which were really fast to adopt.<br><br>For example - Let's say you process everything following the do-it-tomorrow rule, and you follow this rule in an algorithmic way.  Here is how something can happen:<br>(Day 1) You receive an email - you see it is not immediate-urgent, so you let it wait till tomorrow<br>(Day 2) You process that email together with the rest of yesterday's email.  But this particular email requires you to think and reflect and write a thorough response -- might take you half an hour.   So, you put it on your DIT list for a task on tomorrow's list.<br>(Day 3) You take action on that email, and finally send your response.<br><br>Meanwhile other people on the thread have already carried on the discussion without you, and your response is seen as late or irrelevant or kicking a dead horse.  Even if you are bringing new information to the table, a decision has already been made and people have moved on.<br><br>My main point:  Don't always take the DIT rule absolutely literally.   Maybe you aren't in an environment with such heavy email traffic and the need for many emails to have a same-day response.   But I am, and I have gone back to scanning my emails in between meetings or whenever I get back from a break -- several times a day -- and dispositioning them more quickly.  I still respond to most of them next-day, but not on Day 3.   <br><br>Also, if you need a good daily notebook, I really like this one:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/886613113X">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/886613113X</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2012 at 20:28 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>DIT's algorithm worked well for me until I fell too far behind. At first, it was easy enough to treat each week as a single AF1 page. Then things slid more and it fell apart. <br><br>It worked great for high-priority tasks and well-enough for mid-priority repeating tasks. If I planned to do it on the 15th and stuff came up between now and then that made that unreasonable, it wasn't a big deal. Do it a bit early or let it slide a bit.<br><br>It fell down for low-priority tasks. When life got busy, they slid too far and I had too many low-priority things backlogged. They weren't low-enough to drop, but they slid far enough that it was too discouraging. Because they were spread out over several months, they were hard to find and reschedule.<br><br>The real gold of that method was realizing that I could do more in a day than I realized, but not as much as I hoped.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 November 2012 at 3:47 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;until I fell too far behind.&gt;&gt;<br><br>I cannot think of one system - I tried most of 'em - where (given enough time) this would be the case. In my situation, this has more to do with the allure of the system wearing off than workload.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 November 2012 at 12:15 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm an eternal optimist and overload my system. Even my daily focus list is often too long -- but at least the things I really need to do are in one place. Every time I see it, I get a reality check. If they're spread over several pages? Out-of-sight, out-of-mind. If a system lets me schedule things in advance, it's too easy to think I'll have a good week and load it up.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 November 2012 at 14:19 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The one feature I like most about DIT is how it regulates the overall commitment level.  It does this a lot better than any other of Mark's systems (including DWM, which is very similar to DIT).<br><br>After a short time using DIT, it becomes clear how much I can really handle in one day.    It usually boils down to my current initiative, plus 4-8 recurring items (clear inbox, clear voicemail, change furnace filters, etc.), plus 8-12 other items max.   <br><br>If I put more than that on my page, I will have a very hard time getting it all done in one day.<br><br>Knowing this, I try to limit how much I put on the page for any one day.  I write the current initiative at the top of the page (or use a sticky note and move it along day-to-day).   Then I reserve about 8 lines for recurring items.   If they get filled up, I write them on the next page.   I write everything else that comes up, below those lines.   If it starts getting too long, I know I have to spread things out.<br><br>Sometimes I can spread things out over the coming week, rather than always putting everything on the page for Tomorrow.   This helps balance things out.<br><br>It can also be helpful to leave one day a week empty.   At my job, they discourage you from setting up meetings on Fridays, especially Friday afternoons, so I also try to keep my DIT page clear on Fridays.   I use the time for current initiative, catch-up, clean-up, clearing backlogs from the week, resetting, looking forward to the weekend and following week.  Basically, I try to make sure I am on top of my work.   And then, if I am feeling on top of my work, I spend the rest of the day on things that require more deep thinking and engaged work that will really move my work forward.<br><br>It doesn't always work out that way, but keeping the day clear of the usual task list helps.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 November 2012 at 17:10 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re falling behind in DIT:<br><br>There's a very important principle in the book which I think people tend to ignore.This is that falling behind is an essential part of the system. <br><br>Falling behind is the trigger for an audit of commitments. The theory behind this is that all work comes from the commitments we have made, either explicitly or implicitly. These commitments may be to ourselves, to our colleagues, employers, friends, family, clients, subordinates, etc. etc. <br><br>We should aim to fulfill all our commitments to the degree envisaged when making that commitment. If we can't do that, then it would be better not to take on the commitment in the first place.<br><br>If we are falling behind, this means that we are failing in some of our commitments. The further we fall behind the more we are failing. The way to keep up is to reduce our commitments - hence the audit.<br><br>The balance we should be aiming for is "the amount of work that falls due each day equals on average the amount of work we do each day". <br><br>For this to work it's important that we don't preselect the following days work. Spreading things out in the way that Seraphim recommends above can be fatal to the system because it may disguise the fact that we are falling behind and stop us from tackling the real problem - which is that we are overcommitted.<br><br>There are of course always going to be days on which one doesn't get through the list. But you should be able to catch up within a few days. Anything longer than that means an audit. By "catch up" I mean doing every outstanding task. The aim is to be on top of every current commitment that you have.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 November 2012 at 15:46 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Meanwhile other people on the thread have already carried on the discussion without you, and your response is seen as late or irrelevant or kicking a dead horse.

It a failure to allocate the correct priority to the task.
