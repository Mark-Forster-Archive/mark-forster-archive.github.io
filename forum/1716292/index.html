I also notice that I go backward the list during the day from the last items to old one like with AF2. Separating the items makes nothing to the system it complicates the system and I am less efficient.

It seems to me that if you mix both contexts in a single notebook, you will be distracted by home projects and activities when you should be earning your living.  If you work for yourself, that may be okay, but what if you work for someone else?  It's a beautiful day out today, and one of the tasks on my list is wash and wax the motorcycle.  I would much rather do that than sit at a computer or on the phone working.  And what if I decide to take a ride after I'm done cleaning the bike?  Next thing I know it's 8:00pm and I haven't done any "work"!  The boss calls and asks when he's going to get an answer to his email from a few hours ago.  Do you tell him you were working on one of your home projects?  I think it would be better to have two notebooks.  You could keep the "home" notebook by your side, open to the current page, in case you think of something to add to the list, but make it a point not to go through that book until you are ready to switch from work mode to home mode.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2012 at 17:13 | Dave D</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The demands at home are COMPLETELY different from demands at work.

The main reason is that I do a lot of work-related tasks at home, and some home-related tasks when at work.  I have tried using separate pages and the "cave deposits" method of separating the two contexts, but found that a simple ink-color change (easy if you keep a multipen handy) works best.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2012 at 22:49 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mixing work items and personal items is counterproductive and counterintuitive.

If I separated out home and work, then presumably I would have divided up the day into "work" and "home" times. It would just frustrate me to find that I couldn't do a particular job because it was the wrong time of day according to some completely arbitrary rule I had set myself. <br><br>So I can only mow the lawn at weekends in spite of the fact that it's just the right sort of weather this afternoon? <br><br>I've been trying to get hold of someone all day, but I can't call them in the evening when they are most likely to be available? <br><br>I can only sort out my office at a specific time of day? <br><br>That sort of thing would drive me nuts. The reason I have always preferred to work at home rather than in an office is just exactly to be free of rules like that!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2012 at 9:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would encourage everyone to try both one-notebook-rules-all and separate notebooks by location.<br><br>I used to think I would always stick to one notebook for everything. I am a postdoc, so I can work from home or the university and may have an erratic schedule sometimes (much less so these days). My main worry was having work-related things in front of me to do at home; and personal things available to do while at work.<br><br>Since I moved to the UK and got myself in a less erratic schedule, and I was tired of taking my notebook around (I need an A4, plenty of room -- not to write, but to have empty space -- crammed writing can bother me). I decided to test two notebooks, one per location, for a week. I always begin those tests very skeptical, but tell myself the overhead to switch back is so small that it is worth trying.<br><br>Lo and behold, it has been marvellous! I mix and match lots of personal and work-related stuff on both notebooks. When I have to work at home, work is fresh in my head and I just add whatever hot-project I need to tackle on my home notebook. I usually have just 2--3 open pages on each notebook, that also helps. (Dismissal comes very fast, and I am using SF).<br><br>So, as I said, trying the other option can be beneficial. If you do have a good system in place, it is probably a very simple system to switch back to if you decide you don't like the 2- or 1-notebook method.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2012 at 11:14 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;When I have to work at home, work is fresh in my head and I just add whatever hot-project I need to tackle on my home notebook.&gt;<br><br>I second that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2012 at 12:44 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I found the biggest problem with combining work and home tasks in one notebook was that the two domains operate at different cycle rates.
