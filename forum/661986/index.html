At this very moment, I have 100 pages of student writing which I must read for a class that I am teaching tonight at 6 p.m. Eastcoast US time (about 8 hours from now). <br>So far this morning i have done an hour of my own writing, taken care of e-mails, visited this discussion board, checked my Facebook page, backed up my hard-drive, and done some other work for my teaching job.<br>but I can't seem to sit down and read this 100 page document -- and I find myself surfing the net and arriving at places so inane that I can scarcely understand how I got there (for example, an hour ago I stumbled upon the birth chart of the actress Chloe Sevigny. I have no idea how I wound up there, or why, having done so, I spent a good twenty minutes reading it  (Chloe is a Scorpio, in case you're interested).   As we all know, the internet is a vortex for procrastinators, and it's harder than ever when you do much of your work on a computer with high-speed access.<br>Any thoughts on this topic?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 15:23 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>100 pages sounds pretty daunting, eh? Try just reading the first page...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 15:32 | Beth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Beth has a good idea. Come up with a plan that sounds agreeable to you. What if you read 13 pages an hour and however much time is left in that hour is for you to surf the web or do whatever you want? You feel obligated to do this, so now you really don't want to. You can also tell yourself that you really don't HAVE to read them. That's true you know! You can tell the class you'll have them next week. You don't have to read them by tonight. Once you've established that fact, you might determine that you want to. Why do you want to now that you don't have to? Do you want to so that you know how your students are doing? Do you want to so you seem like a caring, competent instructor? Do you want to do it today so you can have the rest of the week free of thinking about their papers? <br><br>If all else fails, try reading one just to see if it's as awful as you fear it will be. It most likely won't be. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 15:48 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just turn your computer right off ? ! Or pack up the 100 pages and go to a nice coffee shop or make yourself some hot chocolate and settle in with the both in a nice reading chair?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 15:53 | Bev</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'd say Bev has almost got it right. Slight adjustment. Do the task *first* and promise yourself you will reward yourself by switching on your computer afterwards or go to that nice coffee shop - or both even! If you can't face 100 pages all in one go, try splitting up it but time the rewards. Use a timer as Mark always suggests. Works for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 16:23 | Kevin Geoghegan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Set a timer for 15 minutes and make yourself read the entire time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 16:35 | Mary</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Steve, are you working through your lists?  Did you have writing, emails, this discussion board, Facebook, hard-drive backup, etc., on your list and did you do them only when they stood out?  It may be that you are not using the system as per the instructions and not doing tasks "when" they stand out.  In my experience, even the most resisted tasks will stand out at some point (strangely) and, as our subconscious knows deadlines as well as we do, if we are operating the system we will be unlikely to miss them.<br><br>However, there are times of backlog and looming deadlines and in such cases Bev's suggestion is an excellent one.  Personally I find that approach to work better than the reward approach as it (a) helps make the task itself more enjoyable and (b) ensures that we are not distracted by vitue of the fact that we only having that one thing with us to work on.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 16:45 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>thanks everyone. i'm turning off my computer now. will report back later.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 16:59 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine, I just feel compelled to say again how much I appreciate all your posts and insights on this board! (I really need to add "writing emails, check discussion board" etc onto my AF list!) <br><br>I think of the "coffeeshop approach" still in the realm of "brute force" strategies and not nearly as elegant as AF, but I do still need to use it myself, sometimes (still a work in progress!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 17:40 | Bev</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Bev!<br><br>I used to use the coffee shop approach a lot when I was travelling in the US (in fact I thought I'd invented it - didn't realise everyone else did it!) I'd be away for a few weeks at a time and took paper &amp; printer with me so that I could write follow up letters whilst travelling rather than waiting a few weeks.  If I went back to my hotel room it was too easy to procrastinate on correspondence and meeting notes so the coffee shops were a fantastic tool for me.  Plus they had cinnamon to add to the coffee!  It's srange but the smell of cinnamon is now a real motivational trigger for me - NLPers would love that one!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 17:59 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well, I'm back after two hours with my computer turned off.  In that time I read 80 pages of the 100 page document which had been giving me so much trouble.  I want to thank everyone for their advice, and to thank Bev in particular.<br>As a side note, this was the first time I had turned off my computer in several weeks (I usually leave it in Sleep mode when I'm not working, which means it only takes seconds to spring back to life).   I found it extremely calming to have the computer turned off (it reminded me of what life felt like in "the old days")  and I think I will add down time like this into my daily life from now on.   I noticed that when my computer was turned off I had the feeling of have more time on hands than before.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 19:21 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You're welcome, Steve! Now, if only I could follow my OWN advice about turning the computer right OFF!! ;o)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 19:36 | Bev</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Congratulations Steve - wow.  Sometimes just airing out the problem can work miracles.  <br><br>I personally am a big believer in the coffee shop approach - I call it cafe-ing.  It works for me because it gets me away from the computer and other distractions and I can focus just on what I bring there.  When I go to my cafes, I see many other people working, which is also motivating, although almost everyone has a laptop and I'm sure they're not all working, maybe not even most of them.  I very, very, very rarely bring my laptop.  This is my no-tech space.  I especially get a lot of work reading done that way.  <br><br>On the once-in-a-blue-moon occasion when the internet is down or the power is out (I'm talking very rare), it's been wonderful not to have the distraction of the internet or other technology.  I wish there was a way that I could enforce no internet periods on myself.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 22:06 | Balfour</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
