In my commercial activities I feel it much better for anticipating my stuff. I feel digital diary are more in a react mode. I feel difficult to feel and plan what I must do in the future and even the advancement of projects. <br>This is the reason why I will on 26th of december, even if it is a little more cumbersome and binding use a paper diary and report my appointements on my digital for having them anywhere. It will also be easier to see what happened in the past to anticipate future actions. <br>Hope that's help.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 December 2011 at 7:42 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison,<br><br>I'm pretty happy with the "calendar" on my Palm Pre.

I find a certain romance (as in "imbued with or dominated by idealism, a desire for adventure, chivalry, etc.", <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/romantic">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/romantic</a> definition #3) in a hand-crafted journal entry. Plus it's much more personal, coming directly from my hand and showing the nuances of my handwriting style. For just jotting notes, I prefer something electronic, but for intimate things like "Dreams" conversations or daily introspection of self, let the act and the result all show my personal touch.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 December 2011 at 19:04 | jFenter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>to Alan's ritual, add:<br><br>fix typos - scroll to next field - repeat entry/fix step there - move to other view - wait a few seconds - confirm it shows up on the right day, meaning it's successfully entered. <br><br>When I change an event, I often remember the old date but see the new one and wonder which is correct. On paper, I can see the old crossed-out entry.<br><br>Repeating events aren't as nice as they seem. You can't add notes to a single event (my turn to bring snacks) or change a single time (starting early for year-end-pot-luck).<br><br>Having said that, I miss some things. My husband (ultra-geek) set our iPods to share calendars. I didn't have to tell him about distant events. However, now that my kids use the central family calendar, I still had to update that for them.<br><br>I also miss the being able to search. When was my last hair appointment? Visit to specialist?<br><br>The electronic was also expandable. I could enter details, such as address, and it didn't take extra room on the overview page. It worked well as a diary, too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 December 2011 at 20:11 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Diaries: the bane of my life.<br><br>I would love to use a single paper diary, but unfortunately I spend half my life in meetings which are invariably arranged and rearranged using the facilities of the corporate email / calendaring system.  As running multiple diaries in parallel is a recipe for disaster, that means the work electronic calendar tends to be the master.<br><br>That used to mean Lotus Notes, but now means Outlook 2010.  As I don't want to have to manually replicate everything into my own diary, I end up putting a lot of personal appointments into my work diary.  My partner uses Outlook too, so I'm a bit stuck really.<br><br>I do have iCal on my personal macbook, and Spanning Sync to synchronise that with Google calendar.  But Notes (at least the version we had at the office) never wanted anything to do with personal calendars wherever they were stored, hence the trend to putting personal stuff in Outlook at work, at least if it happens on a workday.  Very little ends up in gCal at the moment.<br><br>One of the things on my someday/maybe list is to investigate using Outlook pulling in personal calendars from gCal, then I can use my mac for personal stuff and still be able to see it overlaid onto my work calendar to try to avoid clashes.<br><br>I do find the electronic calendars take much longer to operate than paper, and it can be really irritating if I'm trying to e.g. schedule a batch of Hydrotherapy sessions for one of our dogs, on the phone with the vet hospital to book the appointments and simultaneously trying to enter the details into my calendar and send copies of the bookings to my partner as meeting invites.  Then there's the fact that said partner has a work calendar and a separate home calendar held in two different Outlook installations, on different emails, and on different versions, one of which doesn't understand the meeting request format from Outlook 2010 because it's a bit old... so I have to remember to cc both addresses, mark the appointment as private, add a half hour either side of the appointment to account for travel time, include the appointment time in the message subject, and copy the time details into the notes field on the appointment so that the older version of Outlook will display it even if it cannot do anything with the encoded request...  all with the phone clamped between my ear and shoulder trying to type the stuff in.<br><br>I won't even talk about mobile access... I refuse to have a work blackberry, so none of this is visible when away from my desk.  I may be upgrading my mobile phone to an iPhone sometime soon, which will probably make life even more complex.  My life is already full enough that believe it or not, I have to book appointments in my diary to walk the dogs...<br><br>I'm sure there is a way to get all this stuff sorted, but calendars, synchronisation and related stuff seem to be one of those things that the various software /service providers aren't willing to really sort out - it's almost as if Microsoft don't want Outlook/Exchange to be able to interoperate properly with anything else, IBM would prefer that Notes was entirely closed, and even Apple seem to have a problem.  Google would like to interoperate, but many systems won't talk to them properly out of the box and need proprietary solutions... Help!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 December 2011 at 21:05 | Paul Taylor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use Outlook because we use it at work -- awesome for setting up meetings -- and because it synchronizes with my Android phone.  There's an occasional glitch but overall I am very happy with it.   On the Android I can easily add a new appointment placeholder with a few words describing what it is, and then fix it up with details, directions, maps, whatever, when I am at the computer.   I can keep all relevant information easily at hand / linked.   There's no way I could do this with a paper calendar.<br><br>It's also very useful for recurring items such as children's sports practice, regular community meetings, etc., and of course all the repeating work meetings.<br><br>If I need paper -- for example, I want a handy sheet showing my schedule for the day -- it's easy to print out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 December 2011 at 21:49 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
