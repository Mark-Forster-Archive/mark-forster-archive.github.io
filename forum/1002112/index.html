I make up my Will-Do list first thing in the morning, then work it alongside AF4 (in much the same way as Mike has described above).  Thinking again about it, I've really only borrowed the NAME "Will-Do List" from DIT.  Items that arise today that are not urgent for tomorrow are just added to the AF4 list.  <br><br>I'm really looking forward to trying the new method.  Best wishes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 February 2010 at 18:41 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Avrum<br>I don't use AF.  I use a weekly version of DIT with GTD weekly review and some lists. My daily DIT is a combination of my normal habits/checklists and choosing today's work plucked from my weekly aims list that I contructed from my weekly review.  The weekly list is comprised of obligations, projects timeline projections, my monthly goal practice and if I want to cull some things from the master list.  I was trained to working out of a calendar so I still timebox some of my aims and piecemeal others to bring it forward.  Example: Even though Friday has always been my Account Round-up day doesn't mean that I can't crank some of it out on the days previous to it (little and often to help make facing Accounts Day less onerous: I hate accounts work so I try to chip away it in bits. But, come Friday, I have to finish it.  I have other round-up days such as weekly house clean, detail house clean, pick a project of my choice day, etc....It's easier for me to mindless rotate the stuff that doesn't change much from week to week or from day to day such as bundling work using my daily check list.  The most important rule is my scut cap of 90minutes a day or 9 hours a week.  This FORCES me to keep lousy work to an acceptable minimum.  That frees up my mind for things I DO WANT TO DO!  The only deviation from the 90minute scut cap is when I do more to free up a future day that week.  Still, I'm not allowed to do more than 9 hours of scut in any given week unless it's totally out of my control.  The suct cap forces me to choose my scut wisely.  Example: I used to vacuum and mop my floors daily before I had a scut cap.  Now I do it less often with a hardly noticable sacrifice.  My house still  looks and feels clean enough with doing it on a less frequent schedule.  I've also pared down my accounts duties as I was over-doing the "cover my arse" tasks.  The computer software helped tremendously with this.  Bottom line: Scut work can take over much time if it isn't both systemized and carely culled to be effective.  I'd rather use the time and effort toward things what I really feel passion for.  (This includes pure leisure time as well.)  <br>I discovered that much guilt is wasted and lots of busy work isn't really necessary.  Plus, my system keeps me from avoiding work for too long.  Those round-up days and scheduled timeboxes takes care of most of it.<br>It's much easier to implement than write about!  If my damaged brain can work it, it can't be too complicated!

Bless your kind sentiments re the elegant 'princess hat'.  If you were an omnicient observer during my Accounts Day round-up, you'd call me a street brawler with a long shoreman's mouth!  ROTFL!  Yes, it's a bad habit yet it's effective.  If I'm highly resistant, sometimes I can turn it into productive anger!.....not pretty at all but as long as the lousy stuff gets off today's horizon, I'll do whatever it takes.  I just finished a job with the threat of throwing up to $1,000 into my dog's poop bags!  ROTFL!  It did the trick and cost nothing.  It's nicer to be positive, yet......when I feel backed up against the wall, I'd do whatever it takes to get the crap done with!  <br>If I remember, we both work using fairly similar principles.  For us, it's easier to work off of a plan with some flexibility thrown in versus deciding from moment to moment what to do next!  Even though I need a daily list as a focus tool, it's completing the weekly map that makes me chest swell!  If I wasn't afraid of somebody throwing me into the loony bin, I'd probably frame each completed weekly sheet!  LOL!<br>You are absolutely correct when you state that the input from this group helps all in one way or the next!  The 7 day deadline reminds me of my weekly round-up days although the theme is static.  The checklists and round-up days facilitates my not having to write every task down because bundling work streamlines things.  Plus, it's easier for me to do my work that's funnelled into my habits rather than treating each one as a separate concern!  LOL!  I tried AF but my short term memory couldn't handle it.  My weekly DIT/GTD hybrid system doesn't call for deciding and working on the fly.  Once I've prepared the weekly map and decide on each day's focus, I'm good to go with some attitude adjusting and mind trickery mixed in!
