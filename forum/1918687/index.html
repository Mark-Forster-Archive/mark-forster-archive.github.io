I think it's safe to say that all of us reading this forum just get on and do stuff with whatever system we use. But a lot of us — especially Mark — enjoy the art of systems design (or whiskey blending!), and the "smile-inducing" innovation and "aha!" moments sparked through the continual sharing of ideas and asking of simple questions — like Einstein did. From a seedbed of this minutiae and obsessive questioning grow the good ideas that ultimately bloom into systems, or components for systems, fit for every temperament. <br><br>One should always ask if their methods can be improved or simplified as they gain life experience and new insights through the asking of questions and sharing of ideas. Incremental improvement.<br><br>As much as I agree with your command to take action, I strongly oppose the call to "stop this obsessing and endless minutiae". Science is fun. Mark and the forum contributor's questions and science/art experiments with system design have produced solid innovation and have been very helpful to many of us.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2012 at 4:31 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Michael B: I completely understand and agree that it's fun and spawns exploration into interesting areas.  I'm not "calling" for anything.  I'm simply responding honestly to the title of this thread: "Simplest system to improve time usage"<br><br>I've been playing with productivity systems for at least twenty years.  In my experience the __simplest__ system to improve time usage is to get on with your work instead of coming onto a forum to have interesting conversations about how you might possibly think about a new way of possibly getting on with your work, then feeling all faux-productive armed with this new idea that you'll try out (and I use you generally as I've done this far too many times myself).<br><br>If you want a more __efficient__ system then use something as complex as you need to support the slice and dice views you need, and no complex more than that.  That might be a text file, a project management app, a calendar and task list, whatever.  It has an overhead which pays dividends in enabling greater efficiency.  So it's no longer the simplest but it's an improvement.<br><br>If it stops doing that then you've probably gotten good at gaming it and you need to address your own behaviour before you try and fix the system with yet more tweaks, which is just another way of procrastinating and not getting on with your tasks.  There are a large number of people on this kind of forum in this category as well as people who are just discussing for the enjoyment of it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 August 2012 at 1:40 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>the value of "productivity" is questionable<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/5/14/in-praise-of-doing-nothing.html">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/5/14/in-praise-of-doing-nothing.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 August 2012 at 12:15 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For me, two best (and simple) methods which helped me use my time more effectively:<br><br>- time recording everything for cca week<br>- make today plan in the morning, set it aside (copy) and in the evening check what was done, what not.<br><br>From those two activities I learnt that I terribly overestimate my time possibilities and underestimate how long things takes. From this realization, I (1) focused on less number of more important things (usually 3-4 main tasks/day), MIT - most important tasks to be done first or as soon as possible. (2) reduce some pleasant things which took too long (for me it was cooking, which is my great hobby. Yes. You cannot cook two gourmet meals per day and not to expect 2-3 hours to disappear mysteriously...)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 August 2012 at 15:29 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"the value of "productivity" is questionable<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/5/14/in-praise-of-doing-nothing.html&quot;">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/5/14/in-praise-of-doing-nothing.html"</a><br><br>True.

I'm not entirely sure there's a coherent distinction to be made, but let me try.  Writing down a list of things to do and simply looking at them is just going to lead to you doing those things you wrote.  You may do them more efficiently, but it's not necessarily an improvement in how you spend your time.  <br><br>On the other hand, Gerry's simple goal system is specifically directed at managing what you spend your time.  Mark's Dreams book is also.  And recording your activities and reviewing them (as stated in the intro post) is as well.  A to-do list keeps you busy.  A done list keeps you reflective, which leads you to change.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2012 at 20:56 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+JMJ+<br><br>I think AF2 naturally tends to this pattern.  I have been noticing that the things I do most often are always in the forefront of my AF2 list, and I just act on new tasks here and there to keep my list from growing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2012 at 12:50 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I found a quote I had from somewhere, which I paraphrase:<br><br>If everything is put on a timeline, you're going to fail, because the things that the clock will bring you are not the things that the heart will bring you.<br><br>Learn to live without the future. This breaks a mindset that says accomplishment is the measure of success. In a linear time it is; but in a quantum consciousness, accomplishment is measured by the peace and joy at just "being."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2012 at 15:01 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>I use a tm system simply to make sure I don't forget the things I have to do and want to do. This is different than the idea of recording what you actually do.  I think it is a great idea to do what you are describing as it will allow one to see where their focus is and make changes if they like.  I think to compare what we actually do to what we set out to do especially in the area of our big life goals is very valuable.  Thanks for the idea, Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2012 at 16:34 | Gerry</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
