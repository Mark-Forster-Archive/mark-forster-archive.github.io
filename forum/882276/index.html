(Add work-related items from the top of the page, add personal items from the bottom of the page, draw a line across the page where they meet.)<br><br>This doesn't work so well with AF4.  <br><br>It's NOT because of the line.  It's easy just to draw a different style of line -- one that means "end of closed list" and one that means "divider between work and personal on every page".  <br><br>The main reason is that it's too hard to keep track of which items were added most recently, when you're processing the Open List.<br><br>For example, let's say my page looks like this:<br><br>[TOP OF PAGE]<br>- Learn PHP<br>- Weekly planning<br>- Inbox<br>- Agenda for 1:1<br>- Tidy desk  (I love that phrase I learned from Mark!)<br><br>(white space)<br><br>- Laundry<br>- Medical claims<br>- Change furnace filters<br>- Respond to P.H.<br>- Organize District 2 email list<br>[BOTTOM OF PAGE]<br><br>So, I get to this page in AF4, "Open List" mode.  And I'm working down the list.  I decide to work on Laundry.  Meanwhile, I get a phone call  and remember a few other things I need to do, and add a few items to the list.  The personal half of my list now looks like this:<br><br><br>(white space)<br><br>- Fix the kitchen faucet<br>- Check for new CMM files<br>- Call back T.R.<br>- &gt;&gt;&gt; Laundry &lt;&lt;&lt; CURRENTLY BEING WORKED<br>- Medical claims<br>- Change furnace filters<br>- Respond to P.H.<br>- Organize District 2 email list<br>[BOTTOM OF PAGE]<br><br><br>OK, so then I finish working on laundry (at least, decide I don't want/need to work on it any more!).  Which task do I work on next?<br><br>I was working DOWN the page.  But now, I have unlooked-at items both above and below my current task.  Trying to keep track of which ones I haven't looked at yet, makes me dizzy.<br><br><br>So, then I thought maybe I should process my work items working down the page from the top, and after I reach the end of the work items, then I should work the personal items going up the page from the bottom.<br><br>That worked OK till I was working on my personal items, and meanwhile added new work items to the list.<br><br>So, I am kinda stuck and don't know how to do this.<br><br>It's actually only a problem when I am working on the last page of the book.  Once a page is filled, it works just fine to read from top to bottom all the way through the page.  And I really like having work and personal all in one page, but separated into these two groups.  It makes it FAR easier to focus on one or the other if I need to, but still keeps everything visible so I don't forget important personal calls I need to make during the workday, and stuff like that.<br><br>That's why I don't want to entirely abandon the stalagmite/stalactite method, and mix personal and work items in one single long list.<br><br>So, I'm thinking maybe I'll just keep using stalagmite/stalactite, but be a little looser in following the rules strictly when I'm working on the very last page.  Maybe whenever I get into that situation where I can't tell which way is up, I'll just read through from the top of the page again.  This will sometimes result in some items getting worked on that had earlier been skipped on this same pass through the Open List, but that seems a small price to pay for keeping my work and personal items "separate but together".<br><br>Any other thoughts, suggestions, or observations?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 September 2009 at 17:21 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>A tweak, but why don't you just circle the last open page before going back to the beginning of the list, just to make sure you have looked at all the items? I don't think there would be much harm done if you looked / actioned on your a couple of your open list items before going back to the beginning of your list.<br><br>I have a feeling the stalactite/stalagmite method only works well with AF1. And, at least for me, its main purpose was to help me not dismiss home items too often because of the constraints of one page = one closed list. I have since moved to AF2, RAF and now AF4 and never had a problem with mixing home and work items since.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 September 2009 at 21:51 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>You've probably already thought of this and there must be a reason it doesn't work for you, and maybe you've even mentioned in some post why this won't work but. . . . .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>couldn't you just use two columns per page?<br><br>(Maybe not, if one location generates many more tasks than the other locations.)<br><br>-Joseph</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 1:17 | Joseph</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim,<br><br>If I understand your "problem" correctly, you're really asking what to do when new tasks are added to the Active List, while you are working on it. <br><br>Looking at Andreas' AF4-demo.pdf, Mark just continue going through the newly added tasks to Active List (as if they have been there all along).<br><br>I also think drawing a "box" around the "unused whitespace", when converting an Active List to Backlog, would help. Treat the area in the box (and subsequent pages)  as the new Active List.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 5:26 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks everyone for the replies so far.<br><br>@Natalia: &gt;&gt;&gt;why don't you just circle the last open page before going back to the beginning of the list, just to make sure you have looked at all the items?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, this is pretty much what I am considering, if I stay with the stalagmite/stalactite method.  I've been using it for AF1 and RAF and really like it.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have since moved to AF2, RAF and now AF4 and never had a problem with mixing home and work items since&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>On your recommendation I am going to try combining everything, all mixed together, and see if it matters.  Thanks!<br><br>@ Joseph:  &gt;&gt;&gt;couldn't you just use two columns per page?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, I suppose that's possible, but I tend to be verbose and many of my items are written across the whole page.  They'd then have to be written across two or three lines, rather than just one.  Also, I tend to use the rightmost margin for little notes, such as my boss's name, to indicate things I need to track with him.  <br><br>In theory I think your idea would work, but it would be too cumbersome for me.  <br><br>But in a similar vein, I have also considered just writing an arbitrary line across the middle of the page, writing work related items above it, and personal below it, without trying to do the stalagmite/stalactite method.  This will always tend to leave some white space on one list or the other, but that's a small price to pay for keeping the dual locations on a single list.<br><br>The problem with both of these approaches is when I am working on my personal list and happen to add new items to my work list, or vice-versa.  Those are new items that can be processed before switching to the Closed List, but it's easy to miss them.<br><br>@ sevre23t: No, that's not really what I'm asking.  It's clear where new tasks get added -- at the end of the open list (AKA Active List).  The problem arises only because I am using the tried &amp; true stalagmite/stalactite method for handling two contexts/locations in one list, and trying to make it work with the single-look-at-each-task rule for processing the Open List (AKA Active List).  It's easy to lose track of which tasks have been "looked at", since there are really two lists growing together on the last active page.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 6:12 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>Since I was on to something with the dual column idea. . . let me suggest something else that might solve the objections you brought up.<br><br>Could you simply start your notebook on page 2 for home and page 3 for work?

AF2/RAF introduced us to bottom-to-top reading, why not make use of it? Reading the top list top down and the bottom list bottom up should solve the problem.<br><br>Have you ever tried using the notebook from both sides? One list normal from the beginning, but for the other list turn the book 180° and open it from the "back" so that the last page is the first page. Then the lists will meet only once, when the book is full. To avoid confusion where to open it, label each cover accordingly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 6:59 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@ Seraphim: Good luck with your tests! I hope you can find something that works for you.<br><br>As I said before, I only saw the need to separate home and work lists with AF1, but not with the later versions. As a PhD student, I can work at home or at university, and sometimes I don't know in advance if I am staying home tomorrow or not. To recap, I tried all this with AF1, and my experience was:<br><br>- One catch-all list: home and leisure items got dismissed too fast. This meant I was not adding fun items anymore, as I thought they would be dismissed beforehand. It was becoming as stoic as my use of DIT.<br><br>- Two lists, one per location: home list would get neglected; work list was sometimes left at university when I needed to work at home. No-no.<br><br>- Two lists in the same notebook, one starting from the front and another from the back: it was very cumbersome updating the lists. Home list got neglected.<br><br>- Stalactite/stalagmite: It was the best setup for AF1, as I could focus on work items and home items did not face the threat of early dismissal. However, the number of open pages were starting to become unbearable.<br><br>- Not tried: left pages for work and right pages for home; one column for home, other for work. I did not try those because one of my lists grows longer than the other. And I got really fond of the space I have in my A4 notebook lines, after years of trying to fit time management systems into A7/A6/A5 notebooks or diaries.<br><br>So, my main problem was balancing home and work items. On the one hand, I did not have much time for home items, which left me stressed. On the other, the way the system was set up I was easily distracted by home items at work. With AF2 on, I could flip through home items without the threat of early dismissal, and that is why I did not find the need to separate home and work items anymore. And I am finding AF4 is the best of all to keep me focused on what really needs doing, no matter if it is home or work. And I feel AF4 finally helps me find the sweet spot of how many fun items I can action on in proportion to the ones I put in the list (and I still write in many, many crazy ideas on my notebook).<br><br>I do not mean to hijack your thread, I just wanted to share my experiences so you might reconsider/try other things. Maybe you find you do not need the stactite/stalagmite anymore, like I did; maybe you find two notebooks work best; maybe you will finally be happy with the stactite + AF4, just making sure you give an extra scan on your last page because of the way your notebook is setup.<br><br>Re: the arbitrary line, I see the same problem with it as with the stactite method when using AF4.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2009 at 21:06 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I just think the wording 'STALAGMITE/STALACTITE approach' is so convincingly cool, it automatically sounds better than any system out there.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 September 2009 at 22:43 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use 2 notebooks, it works fine. If I have got a home task that can be done at work (ex : call insurance re: house contract), I copy it in the work AF notebook as well. <br>However I have considered using only one book, but using 2 colours : ex : work task written in black, home tasks written in blue. It makes it easy to differnciate them when you scan the list. There is still the problem of the two lists growing at two different paces.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 9:07 | Alexborne</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks everyone for your ideas!<br><br>For a few days, I tried mixing the two "contexts" without any kind of separation.  It didn't really work well for me.  I like being able to quickly find the tasks that are most appropriate for the context I'm in.<br><br>Some have suggested using left page for work, right page for personal.  Maybe that would work fine for someone, but it doesn't work well for me, since I use the left page for meeting notes, phone numbers, scratch paper, etc.<br><br>So I am back to the stalagmite/stalactite method.  The last page on the Open List needs some special processing -- but all it really takes is a quick read-through to check for any new tasks.  I think I was making a mountain out of a molehill -- it's really not that complicated.  I just really like reading from top to bottom through each page, and couldn't do that so easily on the very last page.<br><br>Another thing I am trying, is to start writing the work tasks from the top of the page as usual, but start writing the personal tasks from the middle of the page somewhere, in both cases writing down the page.  I guess you could call this the "upper stalactite / lower stalactite method".  :-)  I just take a swag at where I think the personal tasks should start.  If I'm "working", then they would start closer to the bottom of the page, since I'm focused on work tasks.  If I'm "at home", they would start closer to the top of the page.<br><br>I kinda like this approach since I'm always moving DOWN the page.  <br><br>Probably a very minor issue, but we all have our quirks I suppose.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 September 2009 at 18:17 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
