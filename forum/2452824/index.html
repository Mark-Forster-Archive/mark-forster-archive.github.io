That section says you may do this or this or this, but I was left with a feeling of having lost them.  Today, the only way I ever dismiss something is en-masse when I get away from the list too long and the built-up list is mostly irrelevant and I call it a backlog.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 December 2014 at 16:50 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Tolstoy's explanation of "standing out"?:<br><br>"When observing his own life, a man may often notice in himself two different beings: the one is blind and physical, the other sees and is spiritual. The blind animal being eats, drinks, rests, sleeps, propagates, and moves, like a wound-up machine. The seeing, spiritual being that is bound up with the animal does nothing of itself, but only appraises the activity of the animal being; coinciding with it when approving its activity, and diverging from it when disapproving.

It is a feeling of "Meh, I have don't time for them today."  This is compared to dismissing them after several days to weeks of staying in the list, especially if they were passed over less often, like for example there were days I did not use the list.  It is a feeling of "Goodness, all that time and I haven't touched any of these?"<br><br>I guess this is the reason I had been leaning to 1-2 week dismissals in my systems lately.  And yes, I find it easy to dismiss tasks in CAF4 because of this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 January 2015 at 16:34 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A wry observation from Stephen Covey in his book "First Things First" (in conversation with his daughter about her new baby):<br><br>" “I schedule time to do these other things, but then I’m constantly interrupted by my baby.” I talked to her about the concept of a compass, not a clock. “You’re being governed by your internal compass, your conscience, and you’re doing something of enormous good.

I'll try to stretch my imagination<br><br>1. We have to assume that his daughter doesn't have many ongoing obligations!<br><br>a. No career with important project deadlines, meetings, etc<br>b. No bills that become due during those few weeks<br>c. No doctor or dentist appointments for her or her baby or other children<br>d. No investments to watch<br>e. No active role in church or community organizations<br>f. No furthering education courses with assignment deadlines or term papers, thesis timelines to track<br>g. no house maintenance upkeep<br>h. No standing familial or social obligations<br><br>The list goes on.  I'm guessing that he really meant to advise her to relax her own expectations and goals for this period of time rather than to "dismiss" her actual ongoing responsibilities and social ties. Maintaining your values, reputation and quality of life  always includes responsibilities. Even when you're rich enough to hire out, the ultimate responsibilities are still on you.  Maybe you can get away with a couple of weeks vacation ONLY if you front loaded most of those ongoing responsibilities ahead of time ..... or have significant others willing to put your responsibilities on their back.or.... have an extremely low level of conscientiousness...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 January 2015 at 11:23 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's us told,  Learning!<br><br>I see you numbered your points as Item 1, Sub-items a)-h).

Resistance is a response to anything that you don't want to get yourself engaged in.  Perhaps your intelligent mind is innocently trying to protect you from the negative experiences of boredom.  That's my plausible half truth and I'm sticking with it.

It is NOT deleting forever your tasks you have not touched on for a few weeks or months.  This is the reason why dismissal will fail without regular review of the dismissed items.<br><br>In the case of Stephen Covey's daughter (and I do remember this from reading "First Things First" years ago), what was essential back then was to learn to live with her baby.  Covey's advise was to cut down on her responsibilities and if needed give them even if temporarily to her family (and thus also learn about interdependency, one of the the main tenets of Stephen Covey's thinking) so that she can "be" with her baby.  Then once she gets used to being a mother, she can gradually go back to her usual routines and responsibilities.<br><br>This is exactly what dismissal is all about.<br><br>Or, using your own words, "to relax her own expectations and goals for this period of time" is what dismissal is all about, and it is michael's point in his post.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2015 at 18:11 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Nuntym<br>Thank you for your thoughtful reply but I know what dismissal is.  The quote threw me off "Throw away your planner for a few weeks. Only one thing is needful. So, relax and enjoy the very nature of this interruption to your life.”"<br><br>Again, I repeat: "Throw away your planner for a few weeks."  In my guess, I did mention about the possibility of significant others willing to take on her responsibilities but michael never expounded upon it like you just did.<br><br>I've dismissed very few things since 2007 unless I was jotting down possible ideas or options as a thinking tool, not dismissing actual actions.  Like DIT, I make WILL DO lists.  Anything that falls off of my plate is incoming busyness that's not worth my bother. I know that dismiss doesn't mean delete. It means to allow it to fall off of your action list. You may decide to re-enter it or finally delete it at a future time.  My WILL DO list differs from canonical DIT. DIT has a checklist of doing or at least addressing all incoming.  My brain organizes in categories. Therefore, I make a weekly map and create a daily map to guide me.<br><br>For my ideas, I dismiss and delete many of them!  LOL!<br><br>Thanks for explaining the full context of Covey's message.  THAT makes sense, not michael's parsed version.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 January 2015 at 19:08 | learning as I go</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
