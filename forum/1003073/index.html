How exciting!  The first thing I did this morning was to read the instructions, and I immediately got started   I was just about at the end of my AF4 notebook, and had a new one ready to use, so I've started it by entering dates from 8 February till 2 March.  Then on the 2 March date my first two tasks were entered: "Read all blog and forum comments since yesterday"  and "Think about how to handle previous AF4 list", and there I was, up and running!   <br><br>It's taken me some time to read through all the comments on the blog and discussion forum.  I think the system is great, and I'm sure you won't regret throwing it open to comments, to help you refine it further.  I understand that the system will have a 1-month start-up time  to get up to speed.<br><br>Here are my thoughts so far, and I hope you'll correct me if there's anything amiss.  (Just as I was previewing this post, I saw Mike's above, and that's exactly what I think, and hope I have addressed below).<br><br>I think there are three key points that should be hammered into our heads:<br><br>(1) The active list starts at today's date and ends where you've written any new tasks that occur to you today (on the page with the same date of the following month).  <br><br>(2) You work the active list in the same way as previously in Autofocus, checking each task to see if it stands out as ready to be worked on.   This means that every single task on the list is available to be worked on right this instant, whether it appears on the page with today's date, or on the page with a date one month from today, or on any page in between.  So an urgent task which just appeared today, and needs to be worked on today, can be actioned by moving through the list ignoring all the items before it.   Once it's been actioned, you carry cycling through each item on the list again.  Some peoplle may only cycle through the list once every few days, but most people will have urgent tasks on their list, and may cycle through the list many times a day.  <br><br>(3) When you open your notebook at today's date, the list of items will be composed of: <br><br>(a) crossed-off tasks which were added either 1 month ago (and have been crossed off because they were worked on since they were added), or 1 week ago (and have been crossed off because they were worked on since they were added)<br>(b) open tasks which were added 1 month ago (and have not been worked on since, so if you don't work on them today they get dismissed),<br>(c) open tasks which were added 1 week ago (and have not been worked on since, so if you don't work on them today they get dismissed).<br><br>Best wishes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 11:56 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Since all the diary pages are treated as one long list, all parts of the list are able to be accessed at any one time. So an urgent item is just as likely to get done on the page for Mar 2 as on the page for Feb 2.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br><br>I suppose that depends significantly on one's manner of processing the list.  For myself, I am treating it as a series of closed list, and read through them AF1-style (start each day on "today", come to new page, scan through it, consider carefully each item, take action on whatever stands out, keep cycling the page till nothing stands out).<br><br>For now, it works just fine.  But do you think that will continue to work just as effectively, after you've got tasks spread across 30 pages?  (i.e., after this program has been going for a full month)<br><br>I'm trying it "as written" for now, but I share Mike's concern.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 15:25 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Let me clarify my last post.<br><br>I realize that I could "jump ahead" at any time and go to the last page to see what urgent things are waiting for me there.  <br><br>But potentially, there could be urgent things scattered all across 30 pages, but no automated way for me to see those items in time if I happen to get bogged down with a few pressing projects or have been away from my list for a few days.<br><br>By putting items that must be done today, on today's list (e.g., "below the line", DIT-style), and putting items that must be started by February 20th on the 2/20 page, then it seems it would helps automate that so you don't have to go "searching" for urgent tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 February 2010 at 15:28 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>&lt;&lt; there is a POWERFUL psychological factor ... if it is on the March 2nd page it does not need to be worked on until March 2nd.

These are tasks which need to be done today or never. Same applies to tasks with a deadline. They have to be finished by that day or never (sort of, depends on the person who set the deadline). Thus I would write those tasks on the deadline date’s page (or in one month time whatever is earlier).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 14:04 | Christian G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree about tasks with a deadline.  I just can't see myself adding them on a date AFTER they are due.  <br><br>Once they have been worked on, they still have a deadline, but they would get reentered a week later if that is less than the deadline.  If you work on anything, you need to work on it again within a week or it dies.  That part doesn't bother me.  (I add the deadline in square brackets at the end of the task so I know when it must be complete.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 14:16 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just a thought:<br>Maybe one could use the diary/calendar in another way, having the appointments/meetings plus the real deadlines written in the upper part of the page, then drawing a horizontal line, below that line leaving same space for the same-day-urgent tasks, then drawing another horizontal line, and entering the DWM (DIT2AF5) tasks below the second horizontal line (assuming there is enough space, or maybe using a spread of two pages for one single day).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 14:59 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I can assure all those who are planning to change the rules without even trying them that they really do work. <br><br>I did spend some considerable time working on this and tried many things out, including exactly what you are proposing. There was only one thing wrong with it - it didn't work.<br><br>The advantage of having only two "entry points" is that every page apart from those two days is a closed list. If you start adding things to them they stop being closed lists and you lose the big psychological advantage this system has.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2010 at 15:43 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Thanks for the explanation of why we shouldn't add things anywhere except those two pages.
