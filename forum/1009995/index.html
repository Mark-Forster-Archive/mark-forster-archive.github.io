I am struck how well it deals with the backlog.  The backlog has gone in for a month's time.  A month is long enough to clear the backlog.  The system feels like the full integration of all Mark's time management theories.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 11:38 | Man of Kent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You tell it like it is, Man!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 12:06 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The other point which struck me was that so many time management systems give you a long list of tasks.  This gave me the negative feeling that these were tasks that I should have done but hadn't.  However in reality a lot of these tasks were not really overdue they just needed doing in the future.  DWM moves the mindset from feeling behind to getting ahead.  This feels really positive to me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 12:28 | Man of Kent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The "getting ahead" is one thing I am really LIKING about DWM (more thoughts forthcoming, but I want to give it more time before I write up a full assessment) - I won't be dismissing anything until the 13th at least and I see no reason why I won't continue to be ahead of the actual do-or-die date.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 13:12 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree. But to me, DWM doesn't have a backlog. All the tasks are today or future - there isn't a list of tasks from yesterday/last week (aka backlog) that need to be caught up. <br><br>I'm doing DWM on paper at home, and like other posters, I was very concerned about having multiple pages of lists. I started the DWM list last Friday, so at the moment I've got about 8 pages  with items.  On  the AF lists, once I got beyond 3 or 4 active pages, I'd start dismissing even before the 'right' time because I didn't like having that much undone. I read through the 8 DWM pages this morning and I was VERY pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as stressful as going through 5 pages of AF lists. I think it's because, like Sarah mentions, DWM has a feeling of 'getting ahead' instead of "playing catch up"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 14:33 | Lillian</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Me, too, I LOVE the "getting ahead" aspect. Very motivating for me.<br><br>Today is my first day to throw away a page. I started with nine tasks on this page and there are three left for today. One I KNOW will get re-entered (7 days down), the other two I already know I can accomplish in short order before the day is out.<br><br>Then I look at tomorrow's about-to-be-tossed list and there's NOTHING on that one that isn't already checked off! Woo hoo!! Thursday's has 2, Friday's has 5. So I mentally think, Man! I am ahead of the game!... instead of my usual, Urgh! I am so far behind.<br><br>VERY invigorating. LOVE this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 14:45 | Allison</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;DWM moves the mindset from feeling behind to getting ahead. This feels really positive to me. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes! This is a KEY insight. This is why DWM is so good. Today is February 9, and I have already completed the February 9 expiration page. I am working the February 10 expiration page now. I love being ahead. <br><br>I still think it would be better using Outlook. But I want to get way past the one-month mark before I experiment with any alterations. But I am using a notebook and I am only writing on one side of each paper. So, I have 2-pages per day (or 4, if you count the back of each page), which means I will be flipping through 40 pages. I hope I don't flip out!<br><br>Like others, I was never able to cycle through my AF list quickly. The typical day involved only one cycle. In DWM I cycle through it constantly. <br><br>I agree with MoK that it is the full integration of Mark's theories because it does have a wonderful balance of structure and flexibility. The structure is the deadlines. They are hard and fast and non-negotiable. The flexibility is the random access. At any time I can go immediately to any item on the list. There is no rule that I must do task 18 before I can move on to task 13.<br><br>I echo MoK's sentiments. I feel transformed by this experience. Thanks, MoK, for the insight and thank, Mark, for never being satisfied with the status quo.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 16:44 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>YES!!   I am becoming more invigorated with DWM as the day goes on.  I guess I just needed a mindset change and a little push.  This is indeed a transforming experience.  I hope Mark and everyone forgives me for my too hasty leaving the system.  But now I am back...smiles...<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 17:09 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Moises - won't you end up with a lot of pages that are blank on both sides?

Spot on Learning, everyones contributions here whether I agree with them or not, are stimulating. That is what makes the forum so unique when combined with Mark's very generous nature of sharing his amazing intellect so freely. I still find it a constant pleasure that we can have such an eclectic mix of people and cultures and 99.9% of the time everyone get's along and respects each others views.<br><br>This thread has been great to follow today, it has helped me get a better grasp of the benefits and what Mark is trying to achieve with the system, as I must admit to not having quite got that from the instructions. Onwards and upwards, will report back later this week on how I am progressing.<br><br>Titch</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 18:35 | titch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Lillian wrote:<br>&lt;&lt;Moises - won't you end up with a lot of pages that are blank on both sides?

I have a column with dates that are entered using fill series (ie not formulae).  Conditional formatting highlights the date one week and one month ahead.  I've put in a few additional rows at the 2 input points.  I just add tasks, cut and paste tasks that move to the 7 day point and when a task is done I just delete the relevant row.  When I start the day I delete yesterdays rows.  Seems to work so far.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2010 at 20:58 | Man of Kent</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
