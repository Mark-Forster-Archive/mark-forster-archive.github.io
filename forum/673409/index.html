So I'd like to use a PDA. I still have several older Palms, one of which I intend to use.<br><br>My problem with implementing the system on a Palm is that I only have two parameters: due date and priority (1-5). <br><br>There are no folders, no start dates, no creation dates. There are categories, but they're limited to 15, so I can't emulate 'pages' that way. I know that there's 3rd party software (e.g. Bonsai, Shadow Plan, KeySuite/KeyTasks) which would help to overcome the folders limitation or offer all the fields Outlook has, but that's not an option in this case (basically, I want to be able to sync to different desktop programs). <br><br>Here's how I'd like to do it: <br><br>- Create every task with a due date of tomorrow, unless it's a *real* due date. <br>- If the task has a *real* due date, set the due date accordingly. <br>- I have to assign every task a priority (by design of the software), so I usually assign "3". However, priorities aren't used in the 'traditional' way.<br>- If the task has a *real* due date, I assign priority "1" (highest). That way, I can tell real due dates from fake ones. And I can sort by priority and see what'really due *now* (you might call that 'Urgency mode'). Again, 'priority' isn't meant to be taken literally.<br>- In 'AF mode', I sort by 'due date', which will show all tasks in the order they were created (roughly, the priority "1" ones will be on top of the respective day). <br>- I don't use page limits or 'page break' dummy tasks, since I hope that the number of newly created tasks will, on average, equal the number of completed tasks every day. It won't matter if this varies a little over time.<br>- If I want to 'cross out and re-enter' a task, I just reassign a due date of 'tomorrow'. Otherwise, I check it off after completion.<br>- When I want to 'dismiss a page', I switch the priority to "5" (lowest).<br>- I filter out completed items and priority "5" items. <br>- I don't use priorities 2 and 4, because they won't sync nicely with Outlook and other desktop programs. <br><br>Given that there might be more Palm users here, and that almost every task management program in existence has at least settings for due date and priority (and could be used in the way described), has anyone tried such a setup? Before I start to move all my tasks over to this digital system, I'd be happy to hear from other's experiences. <br><br>Any helpful comments?<br><br>BTW: <br>Why a due date of 'tomorrow' instead of 'today'? That way, I can easily switch to 'DIT mode' in case 'AF mode' doesn't cut it. <br>An alternative to using priority "5" for dismissal might be a separate "dismissed" or "someday" category I move those items to. I can also filter by category (which is also possible with the stock Palm todo app, unlike the filtering by priority I described above). Altering priorities is a little faster than changing categories.<br><br>Speaking of categories: I can use categories of 'home' and 'work' and only display those, which gives me the opportunitiy to use only one list, but make it work like separate lists if I like (one of the major advantages of a digital solution!).<br><br>Please note that I know quite well that the Palm OS is 'dead', so no need to comment on that. I don't feel like buying anything new, and I don't consider an iPhone, Blackberry, Windows Mobile or anything else offered today a compelling alternative. Yes, I do know what's offered on the market nowadays.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 February 2009 at 21:06 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm a palm user and a diehard anti-paper entusiast.  I have always resisted the productivity bloggers who say the paper is best.  When I started AF, I tried to do it in Palm.  <br><br>I really don't thik it can be done.  <br><br>&lt;i&gt;- I don't use page limits or 'page break' dummy tasks, since I hope that the number of newly created tasks will, on average, equal the number of completed tasks every day.

Page breaks are the most important point!  <br><br>(Although that "dummy task" isn't that bad an idea....hmmmm) <br><br>Disclaimer:  I am an AF newbie. <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 0:21 | Zack</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alex W.,<br><br>I have been using AF for more than a month now, and I am using a Palm (OS 4.1).  <br><br>When I started into AF, I took the paper route, because it just seemed to be the easiest and most natural way to learn the method.  I did not want to have to try to find a way to make it work digitally before I understood the system and had a feel for it working.  Later down the road I stumbled upon my Sony CLIÉ and decided I would give AF on it a shot, since it would enable me to easily take it anywhere that I go.  <br><br>My setup does not really correspond to your wishes outlined in your post, but it does reflect true AF.  I am using the notes section (Memos), not the tasks section, with one Memo representing one AF page, and I limit the page size to 40 entries.<br><br>I love my setup!  It is super portable, easily searchable, wonderfully legible, and highy flexible.  And it did not cost me a thing. :-)<br><br>If anyone's interested in a more detailed description of my AF setup on my Palm, just let me know.<br><br>Joshua</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 0:58 | Joshua</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yeah, if you're going Palm, the Memo approach is best and simplest and requires no software and is the most flexible and transportable ... you can move memos to the Palm Desktop and from there to other places, should you desire.<br><br>The idea is just electronic paper with no bells or whistles.  Though you do have the ability to set an appointment or alarm while you are at it ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 3:18 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>memo!

It is too simple minded.  I would probably just make a little check box in front like this:<br><br>[ ] Do stuff<br><br>Then put in an X if done, and maybe if D if dismissed.  Something like that.  Maybe if you want to do highlighting and strkeout you'd have to use some third party thing.  I don't have suggestion about it yet.  If I think of one, I'll post.  But if you want quick and dirty Palm, then do Memo.<br><br>Another approach is Tasks.  You put a check box when done and then it adds a "done" date.  You can change the sort order and have catgegories, if you like.  It would be like having different notebooks, if that suits you.  You could select ALL to see them all, or when an item is dismissed, change its category to "dismissed" so you'd see all dismissed items.  I dunno.  It would take some fussing to get it to work your way.<br><br>That's the beauty of paper.

With checkoffs and flags there's no problem with striking out and dismissing, and you have any additional option you might want for timed high-priority items as well. Syncs back and forth from Palm to desktop smoothly, and the desktop version has lots of export options that will probably meet your needs for talking to other programs. I see from the manufacturer's product page that the latest version even offers RSS feeds.<br><br>It's not terribly expensive, and has a free trial.<br><br>I'm thinking of shifting my own digital implementation from Backpack (which requires being online) to Listpro -- now that you've reminded me I have it!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 5:38 | Bill Adams</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v><br>My two cents:<br><br>To be quite honnest, I don't see any added value in trying to implement an IS solution (and I'm working in IS...), unless you add "specific fields of interest" in your tool (due dates, pages, links, whatsover), and therefore, abandon the AF method!<br><br>AF is a very simple way to manage your 'unslotted' tasks.

However, I want to stick to the stock Palm databases, since I want to be able to sync to non-Windows machines as well. ListPro's desktop app is Windows-only.<br><br>Re Palm memos: <br><br>Yes, memos are a way to closely mimick the workings of a paper system. However, you give away a lot of the advantages of a digital database system (most importantly, the ability to filter and define different views).<br><br>Re paper vs. digital: <br><br>There are definite advantages of a digital solution, esp. one that you can carry around. Right now, I have a notebook with a list at work, another separate notebook for home, an errands list and a supermarket list in a pocket notebook and yet another list (online in Backpack) for 'home 2' (which is about 150km away). I want to get rid of this listmania, and combine all this into one database, from which I can display the tasks that are relevant for the respective location. Not to mention all the other benefits of digital tools.<br><br>In general:<br><br>It wasn't my intention to complicate the system, just to adapt it to the tool I have. And I think that my ideas *are* true to the principles of AF.<br><br>At its heart, AF is a system to divide a long to-do list into a series of 'closed lists' that you work through sequentially, and in which new items are entered at the end while items that don't prove to be really relevant are sifted out over time. Anything that adheres to these principles can be considered 'true AF'.<br><br>The pages bareer is completely incidental, paper just happens to be that way. Everything that groups new tasks into sub-lists of about 30-40 items will work. It doesn't really matter if it's 31 in one sub-list and 39 in the other. And it doesn't really matter by which criteria you delimit it, be it a manually set limit on the number of items per memo/list/folder (which seems to be the way most people with digital tools do it) or some sort of (creation/start) date. The only issues I can see are that you shouldn't start using real due dates for all your tasks, and the sub-lists shouldn't get too long. On the latter, I doubt that you'll create more than 50 tasks in an ordinary day. It's much more likely that the sub-lists will be pretty short on some days. However, I don't see much of a problem here, because when working on a page, it will be that way at some stage anyway.<br><br>AF is a process, not a specific toolset, and the instructions aren't set in stone. IMO, there's no need for dogmatism.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 12:10 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v><br>@Alex: wow!<br><br>My better wishes for you in implementing your digital solution.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 12:54 | Pascal D.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Alex<br>I like your post.

Right now as I'm becomming accustomed to Autofocus, I do as Mark suggested.....Dating the first task entered for the day to create a reference point.  My little "cheat" is to date the external items in this manner and place a - before items that I happened to think of on that date.  I don't want to confuse the two yet I still have the fluidity of autofocus.....well, as fluid as my feeble working of it allow for.

This is why:<br><br>- Each task can have an attached note to write supporting information into.<br>- When you complete a task you only need check the box<br>- You can have completed tasks assigned a completed date.<br>- When completed, they sort to the bottom and you are left with only incomplete tasks on top.<br>- You can also have completed tasks "hidden"<br>- You can use Categories for different notebooks, if you use more than one.<br>- You can also make a Someday Category for dismissed tasks<br>- You can use Priority 5 for the last page so that you can get there quickly<br>- You can move a task to the end by changing it to Priority 5.  (However this implies that when the last page is no longer the last page, you'd have to change the priority on all of the items there.  So it is a bit of a hack, but not so hard.<br>- To make "pages", you'd really have to use some kind of "marker" every 30 lines or so.<br>- You CAN give items a due date if you want and then see tasks with due dates.<br>- You CAN set alarms for some tasks<br>- You CAN have tasks repeat (for those with that kind of task ... it should go right to the bottom .. I'm not sure I've only looked at it and not tested it.<br>- You can sort by various fields<br><br>I guess my impression is that using Categories, Priority, etc there is quite a bit of flexibility.  But as I said, I have not actually used it for this purpose.  I'm still liking my pocket notebook with no fear of battery running low ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2009 at 20:08 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"memo! Why didn't I think of that?<br><br>How do you strike out and highlight items?<br><br>I'd love to use the palm, so I don't have to carry around the notebook." <br><br>@Zack<br><br>What I do is this:<br><br>1) I created two categories in Memo for AF: Private AF and Business AF.  Inside these two categories I create my AF pages.  <br><br>2) Page titles for overview (= first line of memo) like this:<br><br>AF (private) 1<br><br>3) Highlighting for active page like this:<br><br>AF (private) 1 - HERE -<br><br>Easy to cut and paste to next active page when going from one page to the next.<br><br>4) In order to have a paper-like limit to my memo page, I add a number at the end of every entry, like this:<br><br>- Check AF forum. (1)<br><br>This way I can easily count my way down the page until I reach entry number 40, and then create the next page. <br><br>5) Crossing off items like this:<br><br>///Check AF forum. (1)///<br><br>6) Highlighting of active task while working at it like this:<br><br>*- Check AF forum. (1)<br><br>7) When I have to add a task I have just worked on to the end of the list, I mark my place in the current list like this:<br><br>+++///Check AF forum. (1)///<br><br>That way I'll easily find my place to continue working down the active list after I have added the entry to the end of my list (using copy and paste).<br><br>I use the dot as a bullet list point and not a simple "-", because I find it easier to read that way, but I could not quickly mimick that here in my post.<br><br>As I have said, I love this setup because it is very easy to handle and it replicates AF beautifully on my little super-portable Sony CLIÉ.  Besides, using different categories, I now also manage lists containing points to mention to my clients, friends, etc. when I talk to them, jot down expenses on the go, and capture anything I might want to capture basically everywhere that I go. Simple, super flexible and highly useful. :-)<br><br>Hope that helps,<br><br>Josh</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 0:08 | Joshua</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Joshua,<br><br>Check my description of using Tasks for AF.  You get the automatic check-off and hiding of completed tasks (if you like.)  You can also assign dates to some tasks if that makes sense and alarm them, and have them sort right to the top (page 0, as it were).  I think putting the number on each one is pretty tricky.  You go guy ;-)  I put in 30 dummy line numbers to over write as I go.  I also put in my next page number with a priority higher than one so it stays at the bottom to give me a visual reference of how close I am to the next page.<br><br>I loved the look of Memo, with the easy way to make a Memo a page and have 30 lines ... what I did not like is that all of the things you can do apply to the whole memo and not to each item individually.  IOW, I could not change fonts for entries.  I could not assign categories for individual entries, etc.  Oh, and I had to draw my own little [] check boxes ;-)  Of course, you described your system quite well, but for me, I'd rather just have the system mark it done and move it to the end.  (I think I can do that easily by making it a "repeating" item before I delete it.  It ought to create the new instance right a the end of the list.  (And it goes without saying that it automates those real repetitive items that people have been wondering about.)<br><br>One reason I really wanted the "catatories" to apply to individual items is that I could enter EVERYTHING into the list, then make a decision about moving it to another list (if it were an errand, for instance).  So I could put something there to work on, then at some point make it an errand to go out and buy something.  Pretty nice.<br><br>Many ways to skin this ca...

I have my calendar (Palm and Outlook) for reminders and things like that, and everything else, Memo does just fine for me.<br><br>Still thanks for sharing your thoughts and ideas!<br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2009 at 23:44 | Joshua</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
