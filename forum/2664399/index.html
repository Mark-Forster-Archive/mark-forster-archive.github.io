That is way too much to type out into todo lists so I'm struggling to get a complete list in the first place.<br>Any thought how to get past the basics?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 March 2017 at 15:51 | Alexg</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>These are, for me, the very basics of Mark Forster's thoughts on task lists.<br><br>1. Treat a task list not as a comprehensive list of everything that needs to be done, but as<br>a wide-ranging list of everything that you might do.  This was only recently articulated by Mark, but in my mind this is the most important idea by him with respect to task lists.  <br><br>2. Use closed lists.  Closed lists are lists that you cannot add more items into (hence "closed") but you can only tick off items because you have done them or you decided they are not important anyway.<br><br>3. Use "little and often".  Doing tasks a little at a time frequently is usually more effective than doing a task all at once, especially when it comes to projects.<br><br>4. Use the correct tool for the job.  Almost all of the systems devised by Mark Forster and others in this website are for unscheduled tasks only with limited capacity for handling projects.  For other types of tasks use calendars, contact lists, reminders, etc.  Individual tasks of simple projects can be added into the task management system you are using, but more complex projects need separate notebooks/lists/systems, and the project title or specific tasks of the said project can, if unscheduled, be added into your task management system of choice.<br><br>I would recommend using Flexible Autofocus to start,<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/1/9/flexible-autofocus.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/1/9/flexible-autofocus.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 March 2017 at 18:38 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alexg:<br><br>Personally I use pen and paper, which I find much more suitable for this type of work than trying to type everything - even though I am a fast touch typist.<br><br>The one exception is that I use my Galaxy for The Next Hour.

Just move all the new emails to a new folder, and take care of them in order, newest to oldest. Sometimes a single email will take 10-15 minutes, but that's OK. It's DONE. Altogether I average about 20 seconds per email.<br><br>- If I can't figure out what to do, or there are interdependencies with other emails, tasks, etc., then I throw the email onto a "dynamic list". (At work, that means I move it from Outlook to OneNote. At home, I move it from Gmail to Evernote.)<br><br>I see the dynamic list is a thinking tool, not just an action tool. It's especially not supposed to turn into a project list or project file. The idea is to keep it light and deal with it as quickly as possible  -- ideally, immediately after I'm done with clearing my email. <br><br>This works really well for me. It addresses head-on the main reason emails get stuck -- I am not sure exactly what to do, or how much time to give, or how to figure out all the interdependencies. So I move it to a place where I can easily mark it up, think about it, cut and chop and add comments and move around and figure out what to do -- and get it done.<br><br>Previously I would leave it in my inbox, or flag it, or star it, or something like that -- but keep it in my email tool. Even with NEO, this didn't give me enough flexibility to process it effectively, and it would just sit there and clog up the email system.<br><br>It also helps to unsubscribe from everything, and if there are still bulk emails that you want to get and read, use some filtering tool to put them in a separate folder and treat them as totally optional someday/maybe.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2017 at 2:46 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thank you! You may have solved a headache.<br><br>Many of my emails have to do with ongoing discussions or projects, such as assembling a newsletter, or votes for a topic, or comments on a draft. They trickle in over several days or weeks, but are best handled in a batch.<br><br>It's not worth creating a folder if it's only 5 email over 3 days. Eventually, when the project is done, they'll be moved to the folder for the club, but I don't want active items there. I'd have too many small folders.<br><br>So, I might have 50 email in my inbox that I can't take action on yet.<br><br>I'll try a single folder to combine all those smaller quick projects.
