However, I am using Mark's terminology with my own peculiar initial misunderstanding of the rules that ironically was very successful in my use.  Per DWM's rules, all "new" tasks are entered into the system to be dismissed after 30 days when not actioned by then, and all "re-entered" tasks into the system are deleted after one week of non-action.  Here is the original blog post that detailed the rules of DWM:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html</a><br><br>However, I treat finished recurrent tasks (tasks that you finish then have to do the same work after a period of time, eg. cleaning) as "new" tasks, not "re-entered" tasks.  Only unfinished tasks are treated as "re-entered" tasks.  This wasn't how Mark originally thought of it, and I got into it because of a misunderstanding of the rules, but, as I have said, it is working really well for me.<br><br>-----<br><br>God bless!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 November 2010 at 19:14 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I wish I could describe myself as "at peace," but that is not an accurate description of my typical state of mind. But I am sufficiently at peace that I haven't been the slightest tempted to try any of these new systems. If, a year later, I still read about people raving how these new systems are life transforming, I will consider trying them. For now, like nuntym, I am sticking with DWM.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 November 2010 at 22:03 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My life is being transformed, and my system is one essential element of that transformation.

From the instructions that you linked to:<br><br>"If at any time you commit yourself to a task by taking some action on it, you are put under increased pressure to get it finished by being given only seven calendar days to do some more work on it. Of course many tasks are done in one go, so can be deleted without being re-entered."<br><br>The key words here are "get it finished."  I think Mark would agree that tasks that recur but are not left unfinished (such as doing the laundry, paying bills) are not tasks that need to "get finished" and thus would be entered where the new tasks go. Also, in the instructions for SuperFocus he says that taking the next complete step on a project (such as reading Chapter 2 of War and Peace) counts as a new task, not a re-entered one. Of course, if you only wrote down "Read War and Peace," then it will be unfinished until it's done. But tasks that you complete periodically are quite different.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 November 2010 at 2:59 | George G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with George about recurring tasks. Count each stage as done and enter it as a new task.<br><br>My family (like most) generates laundry constantly. Some days there almost none, some days there is a lot. I only run full loads to save energy, so even when I do all I can, there's still half-a-load to be done.<br><br>Morning laundry is considered done when all the dry laundry (if any) is away and the first load (if any) in the washer. At that point, there's nothing I can do until the machine finishes, so I mark "Monday morning laundry" as done.<br><br>During the day I often move it between machines (I can do 4 loads in a day if I have to). That takes five minutes between other tasks. Clean laundry stays in the laundry room until tomorrow.<br><br>Evening routine includes putting wet clothes, if any, in the dyer, so they don't stay wet overnight.<br><br>So laundry is considered done "for the day" early in the morning, even though by noon there's another clean pile to put away, a load that has to be moved to the dryer sometime before bed, and dirty laundry in the basket.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 November 2010 at 15:45 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The reasons that in the rules as I wrote them recurrent tasks were always re-entered at the 7 day point is that once you have taken some action on them they have been accepted as being part of your life.<br><br>Tasks at the 30-day point are not yet accepted. - they are simply there for consideration.<br><br>In Cricket's example laundry is part of her life and therefore should go in at the 7 day point. It's not as if she's having to make a decision every time she does the laundry as to whether it's part of her life or not.<br><br> On the other hand if she does finally get fed up with doing the laundry all she has to do is leave it for 7 days and it will vanish off the list!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 November 2010 at 23:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; if she does finally get fed up with doing the laundry all she has to do is leave it for 7 days and it will vanish off the list!  &gt;&gt;<br><br>Daily and Weekly recurring items would do fine being re-entered at day +7.<br><br>However Monthly recurring items should really be re-entered at day +30, right?

Similarly, the soft recurring monthly tasks. <br><br>For example, my "(m) Bills online (4dec10)" is now on expiring 9dec10 page, since I actually did the previous month bills on 11nov (11th is the latest I do it usually). Oops, I just noticed I had left my DWM.xls month entry days to be 28 (just changed it to 31).

Oh this "(d) Mark Forster AF DWM forum" is of course a daily recurring task. ;-)<br><br>I hate putting soft recurring tasks in my calendar, since I tend not to do it on the day I set it, and then have to move the task multiple times.
