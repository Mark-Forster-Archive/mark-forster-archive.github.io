I have been observing people in the work place for over 25 years and many don't look like they follow any method.  I see people all the time who write on a post it, then a note pad, then something else.  The most productive place I worked had in the supply cabinet tons of spiral notebooks which everyone form the top down used and carried around.  Although there never was a formal training as to how to use them or a method dispensed, I noticed that compared to other firms where the supply cabinet had legal pads and post its, the people were much more productive.  I am not sure it can all be attributed to this, but there may be a connection.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 November 2011 at 18:24 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Trish:&lt;&lt;Then, for me, there is that thing that sets in and I can't face my lists.

Working through a system is very hard knowing whatever I pick is ignoring stuff I didn't pick.  Not working through a system is even harder, knowing whatever I pick is ignoring various indefinite things I can't think of but some of them are important.  Two remedies work for me: Thinking through all my commitments and arriving at clarity, and working little/often on a restricted list of tasks ultimately settling on one or two of the biggies.<br><br>As soon as I can get past the pressure, I'm able to work faster and better again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 November 2011 at 22:12 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I finished four days of this system.  I started with a about a page and a half (using the back).  It was a mix of outcomes and tasks. <br><br>I quickly filled more than a page and realized to stick to a page, I would either need to write smaller or rewrite the page pretty frequently.  As I use this system, I am finding, I can think and write more in terms of outcomes as opposed to tasks.  By reminding myself the outcomes I am after, the actions and tasks naturally fall into place.<br><br>It may be a good exercise to rewrite the page as a sort of pruning exercise.  Normally, I don't like lots of rewriting as I find it a waste of time<br><br>I think I will stick with this another week.  On the plus side, it is actually refreshing to look at a single sheet of paper and see all of the results you are looking accomplish.  As a manager, it seems more intuitive than a long list of tasks, as I am finding it easier to delegate and follow up with people using outcomes as opposed to tasks.  This is in essence a simple way to apply the principals of the goal system I developed applied to TM.  <br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 November 2011 at 21:15 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Took me 5 minutes to figure out what system you meant.

I wonder if it would be worth changing the phrases..."The only result (or outcome) I want today is..." and "Results (or outcomes) I would like over the next week or so". Or may be you have some suggestions?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 November 2011 at 20:48 | leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>leon:&lt;&lt;"Results (or outcomes) I would like...&gt;&gt;<br><br>Perfect day recipe?:<br><br>Personally I'm currently adding more "inner" outcomes as results I want. So productivity -yes, but also pleasure - yes, happiness -yes and peace of mind-yes. so the "action" of taking time to be calm and feel what should be done next is the important state to take action from. Inner state first. Action second. <br><br> I also aim for a balance between motivation (rewards) and inspiration from deeper within. To that end I'm practicing deliberately handing over issue to my unconscious as suggested in the "59 seconds" book (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/59-Seconds-Think-little-change/dp/023074429X).">http://www.amazon.co.uk/59-Seconds-Think-little-change/dp/023074429X).</a> So another outcome is "timing" management - the right thing done at the right moment. All very Zen. Which is excellent, in my opinion.<br><br>Like this? <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://zenhabits.net/17-unbeatable-ways-to-create-a-peaceful-relaxed-workday/">http://zenhabits.net/17-unbeatable-ways-to-create-a-peaceful-relaxed-workday/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 November 2011 at 15:47 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;The most productive place I worked had in the supply cabinet tons of spiral notebooks...  other firms ... legal pads and post-its&gt;&gt;<br><br>Thought: are spiral notebooks more productive than legal pads? I could believe that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2011 at 12:38 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I actually think there is a connection and it helped me develop the rule of writing in one place.  With legal pads they tend to get messier as time goes on and since they don't have a cover it makes it more difficult to to keep pages on.  If one has the discipline to use a legal pad and constantly remove pages either to toss or file, they can be a great tool.  Otherwise, I think it is best to keep it all in one place and when the spiral is full, just simply review it quickly for anything that needs to be filed and toss it.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2011 at 15:55 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You need better quality pads if the pages are falling off!
