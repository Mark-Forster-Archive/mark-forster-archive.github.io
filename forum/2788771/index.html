Unlike some, I guess I have never felt the same level of angst around having lots of things on my lists, and I have a clear enough restriction on my incoming work that I don't have a long list to begin with. All of that means that the visual clarity I gained by having it all written down seemed to outweigh the theoretical benefit of not having to "worry". <br><br>That being said, I still really enjoy the Time Surfing process, but I think I enjoy writing stuff down and playing with lists too much to simply do Time Surfing strictly. <br><br>That left me with the conclusion that I wanted some sort of long list system, but I wasn't happy with the level of review that I would end up having to do with the current long list systems. What I then realized was that I ought to give GTD a try again, with a slight twist, in that I'm greatly simplifying my systems down to a three notebook system which essentially has me working off of a single context for next actions. <br><br>I think my theory is that I have really internalized the GTD process a lot, even when I'm *not* doing GTD, and that means I should probably just try to use GTD again and see if I have matured a bit in my use of it and if I will enjoy it more or less than I did in the past. I think I've become better at executing tasks, and that might be the key thing that I needed to make GTD work. <br><br>I also found it almost trivial to set GTD back up for myself, and I was back up and running with a more or less full system in less than a day. So, I don't buy into the idea that GTD is highly complicated or too much work. <br><br>So far, the biggest thing I'm loving is separating out my Waiting Fors, Agendas, Outcomes/Projects, and next actions into their own lists. I haven't done that in a while, and I have to admit that I really like it. I've also taken a bit of long list theory from Mark to enable me to essentially ensure that i have a nice daily checklist that is "workable" that can live right alongside my Next Actions lists, which then means that pretty much all of my work is visible on a single page or only a few pages, in highly actionable form, which is something I didn't figure out how to do in my previous application of GTD. <br><br>It's still way too early to tell how well this will do moving forward, and my plan is to action my next actions list using a long list algorithm if the thing becomes too unwieldy, but otherwise I guess the short version of the story is that I like lists and I'm going to be sticking with them. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 March 2022 at 1:38 | Aaron Hsu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>How to you use the three different notebooks?  Is it something like <br>1 - for projects/outcomes<br>2 - for next actions<br>3 - for waiting-for and agendas<br><br>?<br><br><br>My new AF4R reconceptualization also gives me an "execution" list which is very similar to a all-context GTD "next action" list, and I also have been finding it to be very short, easy to keep on one page so it's all visible at once.  Not sure if that will last, but it's a nice feature.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2022 at 6:39 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have currently:<br><br>1.
