The idea is to use only methods that solve a real problem I actually have, rather than including over-engineering that I don't really need to get my work done well.<br><br>I started with no system, and so far have added a simple list in response to the genuine need that I was developing stress that I might forget things. This is not an "everything" list - just things I feel a need to write down - things I will do very soon. I added the element of dividing this list into one for home and one for work, in response to a genuine need to keep the categories separate in my head to avoid clutter and confusion.<br><br>I anticipate I may end up adding simple daily habit tracking (e.g., exercise, reading), a few project-specific lists in a notebook, and maybe an occasional, as-needed, rough daily plan. However, I am not going to add any of these elements - or any other elements - until I run into an actual problem that requires one of these elements to solve it. I am not allowed to add anything to my experimental system that is not a response to a genuine need.

Because of this, it is unparalleled as a grass catcher: all my projects' tasks are in it, even grocery and shopping items, because anytime I can just group them up.  Indeed, I use it as a "brain dump" like what was encouraged in GTD.  Even daily and weekly goals (labeled as such) are in it. I have even used the system for step-by-step tasks that needed planning like for example fixing that damned insurance claim I had a few weeks ago.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 December 2014 at 18:33 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry, your approach sounds like AF1, with no dismissal? Is that right?<br><br>Mark, your new approach sounds intriguing as always. <br><br>I am still using ToDoist and Timeful, but am going to give the 7 Minute Life Planner a try in the new year. It helps you keep your 90-day goals in mind as you process tasks and includes 5 tasks you'll complete before 11 each day. <br><br>The other change I've made that I really like so far is I've been more firm about assigning tasks to days. Rather than doing a mish-mash of tasks or trying to do a little bit of everything every day, I'm focusing on one area a day. So Thursdays are blog days, for example. I really like feeling that I can dig in and finish things. Doing lots of different kinds of tasks in a day always leaves me wanting and feeling unaccomplished, even though I like the variety.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 December 2014 at 20:25 | Melanie Wilson</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym:<br><br>I had another read of your original post about CAF4 and it sounds intriguing.

My daily driver is a spreadsheet. I begin every day with a smema list of three activities that come from my head. I cross check the smema list with a short list of activites in progress. I time box, in five minute increments. If an item on smema is new i work it for five minutes, next time around ten minutes, etc. If it is an activity in progress I work in it for the next time box in the next n+5 increment that i left off with. This has really helped me ensure that work in progres gets done quickly.<br><br>After I run out of top of my head activites to add to the smema list, one of the activities I add is to work through my other lists, work in progress, work that has hard deadlines, projects I want to work on this week, one off tasks, my larger project list, email inbox. Same rules apply, Anything I add from these lists go on the big three that I work off of, never more than three.<br><br>I do promote and demote off the big three list as context warrants. I often randomize to decide which of the big three I will work on next. If I am doing my prioritization and time boxing correctly, the most important things to do are work in progress and I work on them longer, newer items are improtant but less so and I work on them for less time in a given day. If I am in a zone on a item I will certainly work past a time box. <br><br>I used to (until last week) use Outlook to manage my big list using linnenberger principles (mentioned elsewhere on this forum). I moved to onenote and a project based list, that is less overhead and more solid work is getting done.<br><br>With this method I have a list of only three things to choose from, but during the day I promote and demote things on and off the smema list as context warrents, keeping the list fresh.<br><br>One measure of success for me, I decided to limit my work in progress list to no more than 20 items, but that has not been a problem, I have been finishing work well before that limit.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 December 2014 at 11:52 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark: "is para 2b really necessary? Since every Current List needs something from the Old List (otherwise the Old List is dismissed) why not just select your "root task" from the Old List?"<br><br>I did originally consider this rule before settling on steps 2, 2a,and 2b. I eventually decided against it because I thought that increasing one's flexibility with choosing the "root task" (I like that term btw Mark, thanks!) will eventually help in adding more "current" tasks from the closed list. Fortunately, real life showed this to be the case for me. <br><br>Here is a recent example: I have a childish mild phobia with going to the barber, so whenever this is in my task list it will be pushed further and further back. A few days ago the task "have haircut" was in the Closed List and of course I keep on passing over it when I scan. But then in the Open List I selected "buy presents" and while I was looking for in context tasks I selected the haircut task because, heck, why not, I'd be outside already.<br><br>Thanks for checking out my system, Mark,and although I did not use FV much, I guess it does look a little like FV.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 December 2014 at 16:17 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm keeping my tasks in task lists titled whatever I want them to be titled (Shopping, Grocery, Laundry, Home, Work, Computer Stuff, Goal for this week, Project XYZ etc.). <br><br>I'm reviewing Goals and Projects on a frequent basis, breaking down what I want to break down.

If on Saturday night, this was done submit a 1 otherwise submit a 0.  The must do goal can be simple or complex, important or not.

It's sort of getting to be a habit, but suspect I will always have problems with this kind of maintenance stuff - until both kids are gone and it's just me to worry about magical messes that materialize at will.

From what I got he says that "A project is nothing more than a series of tasks designed to accomplish an outcome" so the project's tasks can be dispersed in the list the system will manage it, like in FV or AF 1 and so on... <br><br>What i found is that like in GTD it is better to make a project list and number them. Then you can report the projects number besides the tasks. When I work on a project I just read the numbers it goes faster and it is easier to follow it. <br><br>What he also says is that it is better to put the next action at the beginning of he task. I also found it easier to do things. Also he says that the list must be about actionable tasks not larger outcomes and each tasks must be dated. At last about notes and details they must go in a az filling system. <br><br>The system is not revolutionary. it is near GTD, it is near MF as well. It is near what Jane wrote years ago... but it works. MF systems works too. <br><br>What I like about it (and them) is the freedom it gives. Obeying to rules is making efforts and is for me simply exhausting. I like simplicity. I like easy systems I still love AF for this . After years Of GTD I can declare that The system is too complicated for my way of thinking. I can do and act with a better result without all this coercion. But I still use the 5 steps because they are in my way of doing my stuff even if I simplified a lot of GTD. <br><br>For me life is too complicated. people sometime too :-) Things are in fact very easy. There is only 3 rules act , act and act. the system must only be there as a reference about things not to block us in our imagination or productivity. <br><br>I dont know what you found Mark about the genious productivity system and I really hope to read it asap but I guess that in fact all these great people had a clear mind about things and systems they used to manage theirs life had surely to be simple and easy.

I consistently find that I run out of gas for following the schedule by day's end. I am trying to give myself free time beginning at 8 pm, but even that may not be enough. The other problem I have is constantly rescheduling what is on my Timeful calendar. I have appointments on my calendar and I have my routine. But once my discretionary task time starts, I could absolutely use SMEMA. That makes so much sense really. If I never scheduled more than 45 minutes into the future, I think I could avoid the constant rescheduling because tasks take too long and I could maintain motivation--because SMEMA is motivating for me. I would pull tasks from my ToDoist list for the day. I would add fun tasks too which I think is why I run out of gas now. Very excited to try this! I think it will work beautifully with Timeful (which automatically saves what you did to your calendar).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2015 at 19:19 | Melanie Wilson</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been using FV just about since it was announced.  For the most part, I think I just follow the rules.  They are so simple, it's just automatic.  I usually have a lot of tasks open (45-65) some of which are ongoing and others are projects.  Some tasks are grouped on a Post-It note and it moves around with the task on the list.<br><br>This has only been effective at work.  At home I tend to be lazy.  I've tried various things including all of Marks various systems.  Still lazy.

When I select a task at random, before working on it, I move forward in the list and ask the FV question: what do I want to do before I do x? I read through the list, preselecting items according to the FV algorithm. When I reach the end of the list, I just go to the beginning of the list, preselecting items (with a dot) until I reach the starred item (the random one). Then, I work the list backwards from the star until I reach the star again, work on that, then pick another random item.  <br><br>What's been happening so far: first thing in the morning, I usually have 4 or 5 FV items, then it's pure random for the rest of the day. On Mondays, for example, I have to get the garbage out by 7:30. <br><br>I just thought of this, but it might allow dismissal as well. If I get to the random item and just don't want to do it, I highlight it for dismissal and dismiss it the next time it comes up randomly (if I still don't want to do it). <br><br>The principal at work for me is that, in an ideal world, if I use the random list on a daily basis, everything will be done ahead of time. Of course, that doesn't always happen, for two reasons: either my input is greater than my output or I have too many public commitments, meetings and appointments and I don't have time to do the kind of work that is on my list and deadlines start to loom. Either way, FV is a kind of safety valve to help me keep up.

First, the random method could not handle close deadlines. If a deadline looms, as they often do, I can't risk that the task will come up randomly, so I have to drop the list and do the task, which is fine, but when I return to the random list I end up with a bit of nagging in the back of my mind that I "should" be working on something closer to a deadline. Otherwise, random was amazing in its ability to eliminate resistance to tasks. <br>Second, the problem with FV was resistance. Over time, I felt strong resistance to the whole list, and just didn't want to do anything. I got tired of making decisions about tasks, asking which one I wanted to do. <br>How does combining random and FV solve my two problems? (1) Deadlines are covered when I scan the list using the FV algorithm. (2) Resistance is eliminated, because amazingly, the only things that come up on the FV portion of my technique are things that I actually really want to do, including deadline stuff. In other words, random seems to bring out the full flowering of FV while FV protects "random" from missing important deadlines and urgent items. It gets better: in actual fact, only rarely now have I felt the need to use FV, and then it is only for one or two items. My tasks are now almost resistance free. <br>Some data: Oldest task, Jan. 9, next oldest task, Jan 18, total tasks, 24. I am a full time pastor, teaching a university course in world religions, just completed my minor comprehensive exam for my PhD and was elected chair of our local school board in December (25,000 students and a 250 million dollar budget). And I feel great and on top of everything!!!<br>I can only describe FV and Random as elegant and liberating and very effective for me.

Do you have any rule about this, e.g. use FV for the first two random tasks of the day only? Or do you just leave it to how you feel at the time?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2015 at 17:01 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark: Great question, now that I think of it, I actually do an FV type scan of all my tasks after each random selection, its just that usually, nothing stands out. Which is interesting - this actually depends on how relevant or useful the randomly selected task is. I throw everything at the list, and if I select something randomly that I could care less about, I'll have a much more active and fulsome FV list. Then as I work back to the randomly selected task, if I still don't feel like doing it, I'll put it on notice for dismissal, a la AF1. This doesn't happen often, usually I do something on it just to move on to the next randomly selected task. Also interestingly, if I randomly select a fairly useless task, I end up clearing lots of those little tasks that populate my list and take a few minutes to do! A great feeling.<br>David: For a while I was experimenting with using all kinds of different methods depending on the mood I was in, but I found it built up too much resistance. But, when I do the FV scan, I don't stop at the end of the list, but I keep going back to the beginning until I reach the randomly selected task. Think of it as a full circle. Sometimes I like to work on these earlier tasks just to clear the page, which has a very AF1 feel to it. <br>Hope that helps.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2015 at 22:29 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Paul MacNeil - What is the exact method you use to determine the first randomly-selected task?   Are all tasks potentially open for selection?   Thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2015 at 1:57 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>HI Seraphim, I'm presupposing familiarity with both the random and FV rules - I haven't changed either rule (at least I don't think I have!!!). All tasks are potentially open for random and FV selection. Here's an overview of the process:<br>1. Select a task at random as per random rules;<br>2. FV pre-selection: Do an FV scan forward through the list, selecting tasks using the FV algorithm (what do I want to do before I do x). Don't stop your FV scan at the end of the list, but continue the FV scan from the beginning of the list, like a big circle. <br>3. One the scan cycle is completed (takes only a few seconds) work on the FV selected tasks in reverse order, as per FV rules, using the random task as your starting point - another circle. So, once you randomly select a task you'll do a forward circle to pre-select and a reverse circle to actually do the work, with the random task acting as the focal point.    <br>4. When you reach the random task (the FV starting point), work on it and then select a new random task.<br>5. repeat. <br>Dismissal: When you reach the random task, if you don't want to do it, put it on notice for dismissal (highlight it or circle it or something). Then, include it in the next FV scan, but if you still don't want to work on it, cross it off forever.  <br>Two additional observations:<br>1. Because this system combines the power of FV pre-selection with the freedom of the random method, older and newer tasks are in perfect balance. This might be because the random phase will more likely select an older orphan task while the newer and probably more significant tasks get pre-selected by FV. Although sometimes I feel drawn to put the older "orphan" tasks (i.e. one or two tasks on a page) on the FV list. It feels so good to clear a whole page, AF1 style. Anyway, tasks are very fresh, in my case only a few days old. <br>2. As mentioned in an earlier post, I'm at the point not where I rarely use FV, and only for one or two tasks when I do. <br>Anyway, it works, hope that helps.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2015 at 15:25 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Paul, I think you have identified my perfect system! I am going to give this a shot. <br><br>I've always had a soft spot for randomisation, but knew that urgent stuff was just nagging me in the background. FV was also a godsend for me, but lacked the playfulness of randomness. You have combined them in a simple and elegant way. I look forward to trying this out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2015 at 8:29 | Fiona</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Paul:<br><br>I think what's been worrying me about your system as you describe it is that you have about a third of the tasks on your list that I have on mine. For me to scan the entire list each time I am going to do a random task would be very time consuming.<br><br>Thinking about this I remembered a variation on the random system which I suggested at the time (I can't find the reference at the moment) which was to mark with a dot any tasks that need to be actioned faster than pure randomness would allow.  This marking up can be done at any time. When you move to the next randomly selected task you do any dotted tasks that you pass on the way.<br><br>It strikes me that this might be more convenient than doing an FV scan each time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2015 at 12:22 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Fiona, I hope it works for you!<br>Mark, interesting observation about the number of tasks on my list. You might be interested in knowing that before I started using the random method I had 40-60 tasks going, which could mean that for me, the random method itself has actually increased my productivity. It dropped at that point to about 20-30 tasks. Once I started combing FV, I don't think I noticed a drop in the number of tasks, but I didn't have to abandon the list because something "came up" that I needed to do because of a deadline. In other words, I'm ahead in my work. I might also add that some of my tasks were broadly defined as projects. For example, late last year I had to write a paper for a grad course, I would just put down "work on paper for Japanese Buddhism," even though doing research is a complex project involving many steps. The granularity of the task (its level of detail) depended on how overwhelmed I felt about it. Sometimes I just had to break it down,(i.e. follow up with Jodo Shinshu bibliography, read ch. 6 of Stone, draft Jodo Shinshu section, etc.) and I would use my list for that, which would expand it considerably. But it was worth it sometimes. I make my list as simple as I can, but not simpler. <br>Regarding the FV scans, my scans take literally seconds. With the combination of random and FV, I find the tasks I need to populate on my FV scan really stand out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2015 at 14:14 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been trying the reverse idea to yours Paul, using fv  starting at yesterday's date to make a chain of 3 to 5 and then randomize the order I do them.

That is your FV list.<br>4) Randomly select a task on your FV list, work it until you complete or you have to stop (for whatever reason). Randomly select the next FV task and do the same<br>5) When you have only a few tasks remaining on your FV list (1 or 2) go back to 2) starting off from your last tick. <br><br>I've been doing this with an Excel list (easy to tick and untick) and loving this for three reasons 1) It has a balance between random and deliberate choice 2) I like to switch tasks, jhere I can do that but commit to completing them and 3) Randomly sleecting from the big list as such has me go through the list quicker than I did with 'AF systems, but oredeliberately than I did with the pure random system.<br><br>What do you think?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2015 at 0:50 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Michael B:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I've found however that it's necessary to restrict the non-random tasks to only those which need to be done now.

I'm going to give this method a go.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2015 at 13:12 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm liking this new method mark, thanks! Before this, I was doing one AF pass through the list followed by one pass using the randomizer, which u suggested in another thread. But I think this new way is a more elegant way of using the randomizer while still staying on top of urgent (and stand out) items. <br><br>I'm two days in but this is how I've been using it:<br>1: draw a random number in the usual way using the randomizer method<br>2: count down the page including crossed out items in the usual way. However, while counting, I'm also doing an AF scan. (I count down in my head. I.e. "17...16...15...14". I do this because otherwise I tend to forget the number that I drew).<br>3. If an item stands out during the count then i work on it. Afterwards I draw a new number and repeat the process. If no item stands out during the count then I do the item when I reach "1" I.e. The item that would have usually been selected by the random method. <br>4. Use sliding in the usual manner when needed. <br><br>It's good fun!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2015 at 11:30 | Joe</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Joe:<br><br>That's an interesting variation, which I hadn't thought of. Let us know how you get on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2015 at 11:36 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been trying Mark's variation, and I like it, but I kept cheating and going back to full-on random +FV. The problem was that I didn't feel I was able to get to the newer, more pressing tasks soon enough with Mark's method. So far in my experience, Mark's method tends to favour the older tasks, more so than even straight random, unless I am doing it wrong. I want to persist with Mark's method for another week or so, because theoretically, I should reach the newer tasks once my randomizer selects newer tasks or passes from the end of the list to the beginning (where it will "catch" newer tasks that stand out - that's hard to explain, I think you have to do it to understand what I mean). In practice, I have found that these newer tasks are getting missed. An odd result: the day after I started Mark's variation, my task list doubled in size, but that might have been circumstances as well - it was a busy week. I'll keep trying it, though, I believe in the value of really persisting with a new method. Having said that, I will try Joe's variation as well (I'm a walking contradiction sometimes).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2015 at 15:32 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wow.<br><br>I have been using a variation of Random-FV for almost two weeks, and I have to say it blows CAF4 out of the water! Resistance just melts for me when I use this method.<br><br>It is a variation though and not the original one posted by Paul Macneil (thanks btw, Reverend!), because I am not using a paper notebook but the smartphone app I was using for CAF4, Speedy Checklist (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://speedychecklist.net/">http://speedychecklist.net/</a> ), which I like because of its simplicity.<br><br>1. Upon starting the day, I close the list with a "horizontal line" item with the current date.  I then count the number of items that are before this "line".  This will be then the maximum number for my random number generator for the rest of the day.<br><br>2.  I generate a random number two times.  Using the second number, I then I count (from the closing line) up if the first number was odd, or down if the first number was even, looping to the end or beginning if needed.<br><br>3.  I look at the item that was selected.  If I do not like to do it or somehow I cannot do it (for example wrong time of the day to do it) then I will mark it with a heavy dot, then "slide" up to the next item (NOTE: the sliding is always up, whether the first number generated earlier was odd or even).  I repeat this until I find a task I would like to do and I can do for that time of the day, upon which I check it.  I then select the "Sort Checked" command, which transports the item I checked to the bottom of the list.<br><br>4.  I go to the top of the list and scan down, selecting a task that answers the question: "What do I want to do before I do the last item I selected?"  I then check that item (if any) and again select the "Sort Checked" command, which again transports the item I checked to the bottom of the list but &lt;above&gt; the items that are already checked below its position.  I then go back to the top of the list and repeat the process until I cannot find any more tasks to check.  <br><br>5.  By the end of the process in step 4 I should have a series of checked tasks at the bottom of my list, with the most urgent items above and the randomly selected task at the bottom.   I then do these tasks in order, unchecking them if they are recurrent or unfinished, or deleting if done and non-recurrent.  I repeat steps 2 to 5 until the end of the day.<br><br>6.  The next day, I close again the previous day as described in step 1.  During this day, the items marked by asterisks must be selected (randomly or by FV) and done or they will be dismissed at the end of the day.  The reasoning for this is that the items in my list must not be clogged with tasks that can be done only in certain days; those items must be in my calendar.  To avoid confusion, I would mark the items I do not like to do it or somehow I cannot do it with asterisks for this day, and then alternate with the heavy dot the next days.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2015 at 15:50 | nuntym</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
