It's a great book, definitely a must read if you are interested by the phenomenon of attention. It has a great deal of importance when it comes to time management. It also has some great comments from Csikszentmihalyi, who is known for writing about 'flow'. <br><br> <br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2009 at 20:17 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This was a fascinating read -- thanks for the link.

I got distracted and thought it was too off topic anyway. It was posting it in a thread that was discussing goals and happiness. <br><br>I'm still halfway the book though but here are some interesting quotes in the chapter about productivity and flow (which you may consider an absorbed state of attention within a particular activity:<br><br>"if you ask me while I'm playing tennis if I'm happy, I'll say, 'Heck! Wait a minute...' Happiness is a later reflection of the flow, rather than the result of the experience at the time." ~ Csikszentmihaly<br><br>The interesting thing about flow is that you can also be in a certain kind flow while procrastinating. Browsing the web can be quite hypnotic, you lose track of time etc. Which segues into another quote:<br><br>"If left to their own devices and genetic programming, and without a salient external stimulus to attract them, most people go into a mode of low-level information processing in which they worry about things or watch television." ~ Csikszentmihaly on leisure<br><br>In contrast, if your work or hobbies often bring you into a state of flow, you may need to increase the 'difficulty' or novelty over time to keep getting into a state of flow. This type of attention can then even be seen as a critical process that aids or evolution.<br><br>When you think about it, flow is said to require an activity that is not too difficult but at the same time not too simple. If our work is too hard, we often display reactions of avoidance, if the work is too boring, again we often display reactions of avoidance, all be it maybe in a different flavour. <br><br>If you think about the problem with many people's lives is that we're engaged with commitments and task lists that are either too boring or too difficult. One of my earlier remarks about Autofocus (or for any time management system), if the activities on the list aren't enriching your experience, your experience is going to suck even if you're getting a lot done. I think to the benefit of AF versus other systems, is that you will be evaluating the why's of resistance which much more effect. That way you can make better decisions about what you're going to do in the future and present.<br><br>The idea of flow as being an attentional process that aids our 'evolution' correlates interestingly with today's world: it's increasing development of technology, faster change, higher amounts of information and choices have created the type of environment where you can experience continual learning and newer levels of difficulty: it's ideal for experiencing flow! <br><br>But one does need to master the attentional process and have the room to create a supporting environment for its corresponding activites. In other words, being able to do the activities that engage flow. I think one of the main issues is that people are having to keep up with an established environment that isn't at all conducive to flow, happiness or satisfying productivity. <br>  <br>I think the way the article Andy posted ended interestingly, talking about distractions not necessarily being a bad thing while putting a different spin on multitasking and how we're adapting to today's world.  I know a lot of successful enterpreneurs with ADD that do indeed thrive (although there are probably 5 that don't for everyone that does). <br><br>related interesting links: in 2010 the most indemand jobs are likely to not have existed 5 years ago:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://shurngroup.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/the-top-10-indemand-jobs-in-2010-did-not-exist-in-2004.html">http://shurngroup.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/the-top-10-indemand-jobs-in-2010-did-not-exist-in-2004.html</a> <br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpEnFwiqdx8&amp;e">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpEnFwiqdx8&amp;e</a><br>(numbers at work!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 June 2009 at 12:49 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sorry for my sometimes crappy editorial skills!

I pay better attention when I'm engaged.  Asking a lot of questions helps.  Taking notes helps.  If I'm really tired and in a meeting in the afternoon, I often have to take notes just to stay awake.  So yes, Mike, it is possible to sit down, shut up and fall asleep.  <br><br>Peter, I have noticed that with time I have become much less focused than I used to be.  For awhile I wondered if I had adult ADD or something (not kidding!) even though I was tremendously focused up until about 5-8 years ago (to the point I got very annoyed with distractions).  I try to combat it by limiting distractions, but that can be difficult to do consciously.   For this reason, I really like to do a little less "little and often" activities and really delve into things more.  Even if it's reading a book in an older descriptive style like Dickens, that can help maintain the ability to focus.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2009 at 3:19 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Those are the words of an octogenarian Zen monk to just about every question I asked him about my "meditation" practice.

Perhaps your definition of "honing attention" is limited to meditation.

He was talking about how people (like us?) will take every opportunity to talk, read, fantasize, intellectualise about a subject rather than actually do it. <br><br>Did I get that right, Norman?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2009 at 8:28 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mel,<br><br>One size fits all:  Ain't that da trut?  Just this moment I completed an online questionnaire at the website of my medical provider.  (I'm going in for a health assessment and am gearing up ;-)  I was, as more and more usual these days, disappointed that it was the same old crap that has not worked twice forever.  I mean, the goals (most of them but not all) are valid, but the means to achieve them are just dumb.  Diet in particular is not so well understood as the establishment would have us believe ... those in the Mediterranean area eat foods that would be considered fatal in our culture yet they thrive for other reasons.<br><br>I understand that it is hard to take individual variation into account, but that is the challenge, no?  I mean, what is the point of doing something just because it is easy to do ... if it accomplishes nothing?<br><br>As to attention and focus, I agree that "sit down and shut up" is not the answer for everyone.  The answer is to do what ever works to "hold attention".  Personally, I hold attention in ways that vary based on what I'm trying to attend to.  To hone attention simply, I practice meditation.  Nothing beats it.  To keep focused on a lecture, I have to engage in all kinds of games to compensate for the often inept delivery of the presenter.  It just depends.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2009 at 9:46 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I reckon it could be well worth getting into the habit of studying something for 20-30 minutes a day.<br><br>This would include making notes by hand where physically possible.<br><br>Bit unfashionable though :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2009 at 11:48 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Re. misinterpretation of some comments - succintness is only valuable when it's accompanied by clarity.  Otherwise it sounds like a koan - and people will tend to make their own interpretations.  Eschew obfuscation; espouse elucidation.<br><br>Mark, in your comment:<br>"people ... will take every opportunity to talk, read, fantasize, intellectualise about a subject rather than actually do it." <br><br>Talking, reading or fantasizing (or envisioning) about a subject may be a critical part of actually doing it.  Those steps can answer questions you have that are preventing you from feeling comfortable just doing it - and prevent errors that you will likely make if you just do it.  The key is to not get stuck in that mode.  To learn enough and then move into doing.  But if you're never doing things that push you beyond the boundaries of what you currently know, you're not challenging yourself enough.   <br><br>I have had more problems at work with people who "just do it" rather than thinking about what they're doing - or who won't ask a question if they don't understand something rather than going down the wrong path.   That's why, when I was training new people, I always took the time to explain how this job/task fit into the big picture of what we were trying to do and what I thought were the ways to get there.  I wanted them to be able to adapt their process (on their own) based on what they revealed in their doing.  I've also worked with some highly productive people that seem to need to talk things through with someone else to wrap their heads around a concept and what we're trying to achieve.  <br><br>I've mentioned before that I don't use AF at work.  I wasn't comfortable with cluttering my mind with what I perceive as "noise."  I have the gift? / problem? of a difficulty with attentional shift.  This was a problem when I used to manage people - until I realized that many times, my job *was* the interruptions.  Here they were, babbling away (sounding like the adults in a Charlie Brown show) and my mind was still focused on what I was doing before the interruption.  I had to learn to focus on them 100% and be able to go back to what I was doing.  I'm still not there - it drives my kids nuts.  (This is very difficult for an Enneagram type 5 to do).  <br><br>My point is (yes, I do have one!) - that extreme focus and attention really isn't all that and a bag of chips.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2009 at 13:47 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with Jacqueline -- it is good to think through things and even fantasize what a successful outcome will be.  Of course, it that is ALL you do, then you need to get off of your butt and move forward!  Smiles...<br><br>I do use AF at work and I must say, in my incredibly busy and complex set of responsibilities and projects, it is working out well.

I like the kill two birds with one stone idea... &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I am not enamored with meditation.  I am simply sharing my experience and that experience is that when I make time to meditate my life runs better.  I know some people are all jazzed about it and wear the club jackets and all.  I'm really not that kind of person.<br><br>My practice is to sit silently in the early morning and practice the normal meditation exercise ... keeping the mind empty.  I do it because doing it strengthens my ability to focus on something in particular when I wish to.  As I related in the past, I have focus problems (both lack thereof and hyper focus).  So practice helps.<br><br>Once a week, on Saturday morning, I drive a few miles to a Korean Buddhist temple and sit for three hours of meditation (mostly sitting with short breaks of walking meditation).  The temple experience is a different experience than my meditating at home.  I don't know why, but it just is.<br><br>"I do not care what you concentrate on, so long as you concentrate. It<br>is the mere disciplining of the thinking machine that counts. But<br>still, you may as well kill two birds with one stone, and concentrate<br>on something useful. I suggest--it is only a suggestion--a little<br>chapter of Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus." (Arnold Bennett)<br><br>Here is the thing ... and I don't expect anyone to believe me without the experience of it ... there is "meditation" and "meditation practice" and they are two very different things.  A similar example might be a virtuoso musician.  Yes, he will practice the Rachmaninoff #3 to get it right.  But he will also practice scales.  Trust me, the best do that.  And, as someone said elsewhere, the top athletes practice the basics of their sport as well.  Golfers practice putting and driving, not just playing games.  They do BOTH.  Why?  Because it simply works.  It has been proven over and over.  If you want to be at the top of your game, never forget to practice the essentials.<br><br>So meditating on Epictetus is a good thing.  No, it's a GREAT thing.  But it is not the same thing as "practicing meditation" ... per se.  If it were, do you think that the Buddhist monks would be practicing so many hours a day for so many years over the centuries?  They must believe that it works.  That book I read on the ship last time (if anyone is interested I'll take the trouble to find the title and author) cited PET scan studies which showed physical changes in the brain from years of meditation practice, as well as functional changes which occur from meditating on something in particular.<br><br>So, I'm not selling anything here.  I'm simply telling you my story.  I NEED a more disciplined mind ... let loose, my mind is a dangerous thing that runs amok ;-)  Maybe drugs would help, but meditation surely does ... and it is cheaper and the only side effect is the time it takes.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; smileypete, I just think it's a good way to start off the day, sort of like exercising physically first thing. You're so much less tempted to eat too much after you did all that hard work. My mother had me read that book when I was a little kid - come on, if a 6 y.o. can do it... :-) And I named one of my sons after Marcus Aurelius (Epictetus now ...). &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>O.K.  I'll bite.  Did you REALLY name your son "Epictetus"?  "Marcus" I can see, bugt "Epictetus" ??? ;-)<br><br>And I agree, meditation on philosophy is a good thing.  I have found another "good thing" to meditate on.  Dreams.  Sometimes I will have rather elaborate dreams which are clearly worth understanding ... I have learned how to "hold" them and carry them to the waking state and then I'll sometimes write them in a journal and meditate about the meaning.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Norman - specialization is for insects. I'm interested to know how you would help a child increase/decrease focus. I've got 2 kids and they are opposite sides of the spectrum. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>ROTF ;-)  Yes, but people need to specialize as well.  However there has to be balance.  The trouble with today's education is that there is too much specialization and not enough generalization.  You need both to be a complete person.  But do you really want to have a child decrease focus, or do you want him to focus on more and different things?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 June 2009 at 20:18 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, I did practice meditation daily for about a year or two many years ago.  I did receive some benefit, but not as much bang for my buck as other things I've done.  I always tell my kids to stick at something for a year and you'll know if it's right for you or not.  (I'm learning to shorten that up in most circumstances).<br><br>What kind of horrible parent do you think I am? :-) Of course it's Marcus!  The other son is the phlegmatic one with a statue of the laughing Buddha in his room.  My Indian friends say that he has/is? "upekkha" which I guess means equanimity or being able to see with patience.  On second thoughts, I wouldn't have them any other way than how they are. :-)<br><br>Did you mean SPECT? - it might be Daniel G. Amen - I showed the SPECT "this is your brain on drugs/booze" pictures in one of Amen's books to my eldest when he was about 10 y.o. and amazingly, he didn't do anything until he was 18.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 June 2009 at 21:36 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>I guess it is a matter of bang for the buck and YMMV in most things.<br><br>Names:  LOL ;-)  Good, I was wondering.

It is not so much because I find it "useful" or that I want to "get something out of it".  Most of the time I really could not articulate any immediate "benefits".<br><br>But I look at it this way: When I am sick with the 'flu, the main thing I need to do is just to shut down all activity and abandon myself to the healing power within me that eventually returns me to health.  Or, with the one I love best in life, I persistently find myself giving over the best of myself to her, letting go of my own priorities, abandoning myself to her, trusting in her, in short, giving her my heart.<br><br>So too in meditation I let go of my thoughts, my planning, my worries, my  sorrows, my feelings, and I trust that the reality that I encounter at the ground of my being will somehow well up and permeate my life. <br><br>I wouldn't even attempt to "prove" that it works, but I do believe that many of the things I find on my AF list are there because of the contemplative flavour this practice brings to my life.<br><br>If this sounds like nonsense to anyone, all I can say is: "Allow yourself to love somebody deeply and see if it changes you".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 June 2009 at 1:47 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jaqueline:<br><br>The recommendation of Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus was alright, it was all the rest I disagreed with.<br><br>A very important guideline for goal setting, time management, and meditation has to be... go and /find/ something that works for you. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 June 2009 at 11:46 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jim, I share your Christian faith.
