I guess I am one of those people that DOES have a lot of urgent tasks and therefore I am finding AF2 to work very well for me!  I think it still has the benefits of AF overall and with some getting used to the new dismissal rules (which I now am starting to like), I think this is a very good system.<br><br>I still maintain separate project lists for major projects and add entries into my AF2 list like "work on project x".  I love how that allows me to focus just on that project and it actually reduces my tendency to multi-task.<br><br>Are there others out there that are finding AF2 to work well for them?<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 20:43 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I absolutely LOVE AF2.  I zip right through the pages, and don't find the mental block that I had before about adding and dismissing items.  A lot of the items my boss asks me to do have to be complete by the end of the day, so this system is perfect and I find that I am much more productive at work.  I even get comments about how co-workers can actually see my desk now.  :)  Thanks again, Mark!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 21:48 | Debs</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have completely abandoned both AF1 and AF2.  DIT has been working well for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 21:50 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm really digging AF2 in that it is reducing the number of pages I have in each of my notebooks.  My work list went from 8 pages to 3 in less than a week and my other business notebook has gone from 12 pages to 8.  I am dismissing more things than I thought I would but I'm really not stressed about letting anything slip.  I put a note at the end of the list to review my dismissed pages (I use a circa so I just remove and file completed pages).  No complaints.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 22:37 | Gretchen Cawthon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm mostly digging AF2. The part about going back to the end of the list after every task was just annoying, so I don't do that, I just keep on working backwards. If a lot of time has passed and I think the conditions have changed, I'll start at the end again. But I don't do it after every task. <br><br>I like the dismissal rule; with AF1, I'd just avoid pages or the list altogether if I thought I was going to have to either work on something I don't want to or dismiss it. This way, I have one or two tasks every day I need to get real about and either save or dismiss, and usually have several days notice that they're going to be on the chopping block, so it feels less traumatic.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 23:24 | Beth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have only read about AF1, and started directly with AF2, so I cannot compare them. For the short experience I have, AF2 works great for me. Thanks Mark.<br><br>I try to follow the rules, but from time to time I keep working backwards, or even jump directly to a task I know is sitting somewhere in the list. I tell myself that my subconscious and the rule both help me to choose what to do next.<br><br>I had only one dismissed item up to now, which happened to be reentered naturally, and till now I have not experienced any fear with dismissal. Items on notice receive usually more autofocus, as I guess it should be.<br><br>I use the calendar only for items with a date, and a separate list for items that I have to repeat on specific days, or weeks, or months. Every morning I review the calendar and this list and enter the items for that day.<br><br>The overall impression is that I'm really more focused and efficient.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 6:12 | Jiru</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think AF2 is better than AF1 because of it's simplicity. We have a description for perfection in developing software: <br>"Perfection is not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove."<br>I think AF2 work so well because it's so easy to learn and use, and still has all the AF1 stuff in it.<br><br>Mark has worked many years in finding good system to help us handle our list of things to do. I think presenting AF1 for the masses and then changing it based on responses from people is a good way to get a better system. Maybe we will have a version 3 as well, that is even more effectivly and easy to use.<br><br>AF2 dismiss a lot more items. I had a hard time with AF1 to let go of items. It's much more easier with AF2.<br><br>I like the way AF2 handles important items. AF1 didn't work so well handling these items.<br><br>Thanks a lot Mark for AF2.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 9:53 | Hans</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I try to avoid to spending much energy on what I and others believe to be "urgent" tasks. Both AF and AF2 helped me to better discern where to place my energy.<br><br>The most obvious benefit for me with AF2 is that it has been helping me accomplish what I usually consider to be "important non-urgent" tasks which come up frequently (exercise). I am very pleased with this outcome.<br><br>I think any system should be given a relatively decent amount of time in use before making any tweaks or broad judgments, so I will stick with AF2 for a while and see how it goes.<br><br>No problems so far with dismissing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 11:35 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm really liking AF2. With AF (which I liked very much) I would actually put aside the list on those days that I had urgent, bottom-of-the-list tasks to handle. Now, I'm working with the list on a daily basis and so much is getting done. I'm really quite amazed at how many tasks are getting crossed off. I'm getting used to going back to the bottom of the list each time I've crossed something off and I see its value. <br><br>Fwiw, I implemented AF2 on my existing AF list. As a result, I'm dismissing only one or two items a day. I've had no problems with the dismissal process.<br><br>I give AF2 a big thumbs up!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 14:24 | Janine Adams</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For me, very well.  I posted an "AF2 after 1 week" post yesterday... the gist is, I love AF2 dismissal, I still occasionally find myself treating pages as a somewhat closed list which is more habit than anything else, and I'm just as productive if not more than I was with AF1.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 15:34 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm liking AF2 after a week and a half. The intuitive use of the list is still good from AF1. <br>I like the move from 2 lists (home and office) to one list, so as I scan my list I know all the tasks before me. It also helps me to keep the list working for me when I am home instead of setting it aside and forgetting to pick it up (guilty with AF1 more than once). <br>I'm also putting more tasks on my AF2 list if for no other reason to monitor things I would just do off list. That is helpful.<br>The dismissal rules for AF2 make sense to me. I could never quite get the logic of the dismissal rules with AF1 so I never dismissed anything. So far, so good.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 17:20 | RevDave</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like AF2 more than its predecessor. <br><br>I do find it a bit tedious to return to the last item so much. I am thinking of doing an experiment. Tomorrow I will do Random Access AF2. As soon as I complete an item, I can go anywhere I want on the list. If anyone (Mark?) has already tried this, please let me know. Thanks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 20:02 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm still sticking with a hybrid for now -- use AF1, but when overwhelmed with urgent things, switch to AF2, at which point add a task "Switch back to AF1".  When that task stands out, switch back to AF1.  At all times, use only AF1 dismissal rules (which means not doing any dismissal at all when in AF2 mode).<br><br>Working well so far.  I especially like that the AF1 dismissal rules are not tied to a "day", since my time to work the list varies significantly from day to day.<br><br>This is working out to be mostly AF1, but AF2 in special circumstances.  I used a similar tweak in the past (when urgency arises, add the pressing tasks to your last page, and start working from last page immediately, then continue with AF1 as normal).  But AF2 seems to handle urgent tasks better than that tweak did.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2009 at 6:36 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF2 is really working well for me. The dismissal rules are incredibly uplifting, however well or badly my day went. <br><br>For example, at the end of yesterday, I was a little stuck at the end of the list with some urgent stuff - incoming calls, preparing for a meeting the next day, etc. One task was due for dismissal. With 15 minutes to go before I had to pack up and leave, I homed in on it, worked it through, and made a couple of breakthroughs that will allow it to move along.<br><br>That just saved my entire day, because whilst being a little headless, I still managed to tackle a matter which I had delayed because it didn't have the urgency of a deadline, but had a high level of importance.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2009 at 9:19 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am preferring AF2, because of the dismissal rules.  Dismissal is automatic, rather than a difficult choice.  (I know that Mark F has written a follow up note, to the effect that AF1 dismissal is automatic also, and should not be difficult, if you follow the rules, but it doesn't feel like that to me.)<br><br>The thing that is really surprising me is how easy it is to rescue tasks threatened by dismissal.  Just a few minutes is often enough to make some useful advancement, so that the task can legitimately be crossed off the start of the list, and reentered at the end, consistent with both versions of AF.  And I'm not talking about some spurious, token action that amounts to cheating in order to con oneself into thinking one has done a little work to satisfy the rules.<br><br>This being so, it makes me wonder why the task got anywhere dismissal in the first place.  To get there, it must have been on the list for many days, and examined many times.  Why then didn't it get done before if it was so realatively easy?  <br><br>I guess one answer is that it only became easy because of all these actions, and AF is proving valuable by overcoming resistance to the task over time.  But I still wish that I could knock things off at an earlier stage if they were going to be that easy to do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2009 at 11:45 | David C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF2 is working fabulously well for me. I liked AF1, but there were a few problems with it, and all those problems are solved with AF2.<br><br>I am doing it pretty much "by the book," even the part about going back to the end of the list each time. If there is a task near the beginning of the list that is pulling me, sometimes my "going back to the beginning" amounts to a very quick scan, not really reading each item. But I figure that is ok ~ it just means that item is really, really standing out, and I need to do it.<br><br>I have my work &amp; home items on one list, and the work items are marked with a symbol. So when I'm at work, I only look at those items. When I'm at home, I tend to read all the items, because I might see something that triggers me to go to the worksite (Much of my work schedule is discretionary.) I also have my DVR programs on the list, and they are highlighted in pink, so I can easily ignore them if I don't want to see TV-watching options (or seek them out if I am wanting to watch something on TV!)<br><br>I am finding that there is much less resistance to using my AF list ~ throwing everything at it ~ With AF1, I would resist putting things on the list, because it might be a couple of days before that item would come up. This caused me to put the list aside for days at a time. Now I can use AF all the time, even for easily-done, routine tasks that I tend to neglect. (I think this will have a good result, because it puts "stoppers" in amongst items that are more likely to make it to the "on notice" stage. Then I won't have more than a couple of things on notice at a time.)<br><br>Dismissal has been psychologically easier, for some reason, and more in line with what Mark describes it should be. Perhaps this is because I can see it coming, and adjust to the idea gradually. Yesterday, I had three tasks on notice, and I dismissed all of them with no problem. That has never happened before ~ I used to look for a loophole rather than dismiss anything!<br><br>This system came at a good time for me, as my daughter left for 2+ years in the Peace Corps this week, and I would have found it very difficult to focus on work, without this AF2 procedure. I moved 58 things forward yesterday, even in an emotionally compromised state of mind. I feel very productive. Thanks, Mark!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2009 at 11:48 | Sarah J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The major impact for me of AF2 is the dismissal procedure.  I take Mark's comment that, done properly AF1 should have worked just as well, but it is only with AF2 that I can see how I had bypassed that without even being totally aware.  I knew that the "standing out" process wasn't working so well but had not quite realised how devious my subconscious had becaome at "dismissal avoidance techniques" and all within the rules!! With AF2 dismissal avoidance is not possible - each day of action that line moves.<br><br>I totally agree that dismissal is somehow psychologically easier - and it is definitely easier to do the tasks, I guess because they always have so many more items to be compared against. If a page had only two or three items left and you had to do one there was usually a fairly high degree of resistance, but comparing those three items against 40 or 50 is a different matter altogether.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2009 at 18:19 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Christine,<br><br>I'm not following.  With AF1, each day of action, if you don't work on an item on a page ... zap, the page is dismissed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2009 at 18:35 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For me, AF2 works like a charm. There are evenings when I'm just too tired for anything (like today). With GTD, I used to read online newspapers and blogs for the whole evening and end up going to bed late because I was too tired even for that. With AF1, I managed to go to bed at a reasonable time and do one or two things (I switched to something similar as proposed in the random access approach, without any dismissal). With AF2, I've managed far more than expected, even though I was home later than usual. I wasn't even able to try my tweak for that situation (which would be to search for items I know that they would stand out in another situation and pick one where working for three minutes makes a difference).<br><br>In addition, the dismissal is far easier for me, even though I'll have to figure out what to do with stuff that was dismissed because I didn't have enough discretionary time. But I see the dismissal of stuff I really want to do as a sign that I want to do more than I have time for.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 July 2009 at 20:08 | lazy cat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike<br><br>&lt;&lt;I'm not following.

It took me a couple of days after reading about it to really start because I didn't want to abandon my AF1 list, but I trusted Mark and decided if he says it's better to start a new list, then I'd do it.  I stuck my list in the back of my Circa (so I could go back if I needed to) and started a new list.<br><br>It's awesome and I haven't looked at that old list until just now.  I've done almost everything on it and what I haven't is dismiss-able or will come up again I'm sure.<br><br>For some reason I crank through this list much faster and it's rarely over two pages.  The "tension" Mark mentioned is great and keeps that dismissal going and won't let me procrastinate as much as I used to.  Since the list is shorter, I only end up scanning a few times a day, usually when sitting back at my desk.  Of course, I'm taking three graduate classes, so I'm usually at my desk.<br><br>I can't wait to see how it works when school is back in session.<br><br>I think DIT/AF1/and AF2 are all great systems that are all similar and will work for almost anyone.  I think which of the three works for you is just a matter of personality or context.  For me--right now--AF2 is a great fit.<br><br>Thanks for the thread, David.

I wasn't looking through the list enough. With AF2 I  like the rule that makes me look through the whole list everyday. I'm getting to know my list much better and finding it less threatening. The dismissal rules are making me dismiss things that could sit in the AF1 list forever with out being dismissed. <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 July 2009 at 0:22 | Mark Squash</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Lazy Cat wrote:<br>the dismissal is far easier for me, even though I'll have to figure out what to do with stuff that was dismissed because I didn't have enough discretionary time.

I am still resisting giving AF2 a good try, because the dismissal process seems arbitrarily tied to however much discretionary time you have available in 1 day (which for me, fluctuates wildly).  The AF1 dismissal process seems more integrated into the whole system.  So, I've been using my AF1/AF2 hybrid (AF1 by default, AF2 in "urgent" mode).<br><br>But Lazy Cat's comment here, that it helps you realize you don't have enough time for all the stuff on your list, might be just what I need.

Perhaps it's because there are rarely more than a few tasks each day, but for me it turns it into a very small "do or dismiss" list and then I can do what I like.  Working from my old list means that I am forced to look at why they have not been actioned - and most of the time it is for pretty unimpressive reasons.  I suspect that you, like me, probably do have "too much" to do but I am now enjoying AF again and doing what stands out rather than wading through a lot of high resistance items.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2009 at 4:05 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim,<br><br>I found the AF1 dismissal rules confusing and arbitrary and never really used them during the months I was trying to work AF1. The AF2 rules make sense. I have rescued some and have dismissed a few without feeling bad about it. I will in the morning dismiss 1 item that I added to my list 11 days ago. That is about where my dismissal line has been sitting after the list matured a bit. So I have about 10 days to give each task a chance.<br><br>I also have a weekly "examine dismissed items" recurring item that has (even with only a couple weeks of doing it) rescued something whose time did finally come to act on. They may be dismissed but they aren't truly gone.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 July 2009 at 5:52 | RevDave</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Christine -- I've decided to give AF2 a try -- currently using it on my old book.  We'll see how it goes.  Thanks for the encouragement!  My greatest fear is similar to one of Mike's -- I don't want to add any overhead, and 15 minutes a day to read through my list is a lot more overhead than I can tolerate.  Some days, that's all the discretionary time I have.<br><br>Hi RevDave -- I am afraid the AF2 rules will enthrone Urgency upon his tyrannical throne, and exile Importance to the wasteland of the Middle Pages -- only to let a handful of the most starved and neglected servants of Importance escape every day as a display of Urgency's benevolence.
