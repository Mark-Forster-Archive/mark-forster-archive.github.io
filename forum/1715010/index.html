As I understand it, one should strive to have only Important tasks on one's list, and do them in order of Urgency. While I am coming to understand the logic of this approach, I have negative feelings associated with the terms Important and Urgent, perhaps from the baggage they have accumulated in earlier TM systems and critiques thereof. These adjectives also have too many syllables. :-)<br><br>So what if we use the adjectives Prime and Ripe instead?  List your Prime tasks, and do each when it is Ripe for doing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2012 at 4:54 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like the suggestion and will try it for myself, but I doubt it will be widely adopted. <br><br>For myself I think a shift in vocabulary can give a different sense and connotation. For myself I had been experimenting with "Soon" and "Postpone" (or "Neglect" if I wanted to emphasise my choices, commitments or default decisions to avoid things). For me "Urgent" is more driving oneself with determination and "ripe" is more in line with intuition letting matters stand out - doing what you feel like doing when you feel like doing it. These issues are the "backstory" to autofocus and superfocus it seems to me. The difference between chronos (clock time) and kairos (the opportune moment) - where value and meaning meet the calendar and the clock. Imagine a Venn diagram, chronos overlapping kairos. The intersection is the "sweet spot" of ripeness.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2012 at 11:17 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't know if it's the same in American English, but in British English describing something as "ripe" has the connotation of a bit overripe and smelly!<br><br>"That cheese is a bit ripe".<br><br>"So are your socks!"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 January 2012 at 11:25 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>MarK : i believe that is one sense of it but according to <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ripe">http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ripe</a><br><br>adjective<br><br>    1(of fruit or grain) developed to the point of readiness for harvesting and eating: a ripe tomato<br>    (of a cheese or wine) fully matured: a ripe Brie<br>    (of a smell or flavour) rich, intense, or pungent: rich, ripe flavours emanate from this wine<br><br>    2 having arrived at the fitting stage or time for a particular action or purpose): land ripe for development they felt that the time was ripe for a new approach<br><br>When the fruit is ripe, it drops from the tree by itself. One moment it hangs by a thread from the branches of the tree. The next moment it falls--not because it has been forced to fall, or has made the effort to jump, but because the tree of life has recognized its ripeness and simply let it go. <br><br>For me "forcing" vs "allowing" is roughly "driving" vs "what feels ready to be done?". One is tense, one is relaxing and in harmony with one's mood and inclinations. Perhaps "plucking" (joke).<br><br>In NLP energy that is ripe may feel bigger, bolder, steadier, closer, more solid, more present, more dense and touchable, juicier, tender, ready! <br><br>Energy that is not ripe can feel further away, more mushy, hazier, smaller, more ethereal...not here yet. I suggest stepping into it, trying it on, feeling it.

I think Readiness is a more friendly term, but it doesn't capture Mark's intention for urgency.  Hot is a better synonym for Urgent. <br><br>Prime (as in primed) is another synonym for Ready, but used as Primacy it's a synonym for Important. So that isn't a good choice.

But something might also stand out because it is Urgent in a bad way; i.e., the Deadline is imminent.  In that case, I would describe the task not as ripe to be done, but overripe, almost spoiled or rotten (overdue).  So Ripe means that it is the right time to do it, neither too soon nor too late. This idea is similar to Mark's "Urgent to start" concept.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 January 2012 at 22:58 | ubi</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
