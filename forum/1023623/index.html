It can be used, for example, for contexts. Tasks can then be filtered by this value. This is the part that requires a little more testing.<br><br>There are 4 shortcuts:<br><br>CTRL-Shift-N: Positions the cursor on an empty line at the end of the list. The cursor can also be positioned manually. After entering the description, the dates are automatically set and the list is re-sorted.<br><br>CTRL-Shift-C: Marks a task as done (moves it to "Closed Tasks"). The closing date is saved in an additional column.<br><br>CTRL-Shift-R: Reenters a task. It works different depending on which worksheet is active. <br>  - When in "Open Tasks", its expiration will be modified to today+7. <br>  - When in "Closed Tasks", the item will be returned to "Open Tasks".<br>  - When in "Expired Tasks" the item will also be reactivated, but its date will be set to today+one month.<br><br>CTRL-Shift-S: Resorts the list (usually there's no need for this, it's done automatically)<br><br>This is how it looks:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s238/walrez/Misc/DWM.jpg">http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s238/walrez/Misc/DWM.jpg</a><br><br>... and this is the download link:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.4shared.com/file/228708616/a79d311d/DWM.html">http://www.4shared.com/file/228708616/a79d311d/DWM.html</a><br><br>Be aware that It's beta-ish, though it seems to work ok.<br><br>Walter</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2010 at 10:39 | Walter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Walter,<br><br>Your spreadsheet is very elegant. I've been happily doing DWM in Excel as well, my sheets are much uglier than yours, but works for me. Here are a few things I've been doing, in case you or anyone else are interested.<br><br>I have a column for link which goes to either the filename or url of what the task relates to. I made a macro that inserts it automatically.<br><br>I have start and stop times that I use to both track my progress and note where I left off on the list. I made a macro that inserts current time and then pastes it as a value so it does not keep updating.<br><br>I have another column for "days left", today's date - the expire date. It's more meaningful to me than some far away date. <br><br>And  when I resechdule a task I do not delete the previous iteration but rather mark it as complete-- this way I keep track on my progress with said task.<br><br>And (now you see what I mean when I say mine sheet is ugly) I have another column for Current Initative, which I use when needed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 February 2010 at 14:49 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am almost ready to abandon paper. Thus far, it's a toss-up between Excel and Outlook (2003). This, Walter, is pushing me closer to Excel, since I've had .pst file problems in the past. This looks quite nice.

Important<br><br>CTRL-Shift-R<br>-When in "Open Tasks"<br><br>I would like to see a copy of the reentered task moved to the "Closed Tasks" sheet. It helps remind me that I've already done that task, and the date that I last did it. Sometimes, I will do the same task a number of times each day. And I would like a record of it.<br><br>B. Important<br><br>I use Excel 2003. When I do CTRL-F for Find. The results of searches in the Description field on the Open Tasks worksheet are inconsistent. I will find some strings and others I will not find. I cannot yet determine what differentiates the cases where it works from those where it does not work. But, obviously, losing the search capability would be a very bad thing.<br><br><br>C.

Yesterday I migrated from paper to your Excel version. I am enjoying it. There's no going back to paper for me. I put your file in my xlstart folder so it opens up each morning when I open Excel.<br><br>It almost makes me want to learn vba. But, since I don't know any programming at all, there's probably better things I could be doing.<br><br>I had a great deal of trepidation about leaving paper, though prior to AF I was always electronic. I used to do DIT in Excel as well. <br><br>What I have found is that none of my concerns about leaving paper have materialized. There have been a lot of upsides going from paper to Excel and, so far, no downsides at all.<br><br>Here are some upsides:<br><br>*completed tasks no longer clutter the open tasks list, leading to<br>*fewer lines to scan<br>*my physical desktop used to have 2 large spiral-bound notebooks (I was in transition from one book to another), now that they're gone there is a huge amount of extra workspace, while having the open Excel file doesn't clutter my computer screen at all<br>*automagical dating and sorting<br>*no need to keep rewriting recurrent tasks<br>*no need to scan empty, or mostly empty, pages</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2010 at 17:40 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Moises,<br><br>I don't know any vba either but FYI Excel has a macro recorder that will record your mouse clicks/keyboarding and make a macro out of it. It's how I have done all my macros which have worked well for me thus far. If you are using Excel 07 the recorder is on the "developer" ribbon.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2010 at 18:15 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi veghead,<br><br>I am quite comfortable with the macro recorder, but, the stuff that Walter's doing appears goes way beyond anything I know how to do with the macro recorder. I actually viewed some Microsoft stuff on VBA, which looks quite intriguing. And, perhaps, I wouldn't actually have to learn that much VBA, since all I would really need to do would be to modify Walter's code.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 February 2010 at 21:40 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; perhaps, I wouldn't actually have to learn that much VBA, since all I would really need to do would be to modify Walter's code &gt;&gt;<br>That's how I learn all my new languages. Get working source code nearest to what I want done. Then incrementally modify it to what I want it to do. Along the way learning just enough of the new language syntax to do my modifications. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2010 at 9:48 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi, moises<br>Here's an updated version:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.4shared.com/file/230942205/7ff49017/DWM.html">http://www.4shared.com/file/230942205/7ff49017/DWM.html</a><br><br>It adds a row to "Closed Tasks" even when you are re-entering.<br><br>To change the date format, you'll have to edit one line of vba code.<br>On Excel, press ALT-F11.

It only succeeds if I search for all of the characters in the cell. If I search for only part of the string, it will not find it.<br><br>For example, if the cell has the followiing: "read Mark Forster blog", and I search "Mark", nothing will be found. Likewise, if I search "Forster" or "blog", nothing will be found. If I search for the entire contents of the cell, "read Mark Forster blog" then it will be found.<br><br>And this is happening in all Excel files.<br><br>Is the script doing this? My memory was that in the past, in Excel, I could do a find and replace, for example, replacing "blog" with "post" and Excel would successfully change "read Mark Forster blog" to "read Mark Forster post".

But, I would much rather be using your application than Outlook. Yours has the advantage of being faster for filtering and sorting. Furthermore, if there ever is the need to renumber (i.e., redate) the items, it can be done in a few seconds with a global "find and replace" in Excel.<br><br>I know some people are just using regular Excel. But your application makes it so much easier by: automatically creating the week and month expiration dates, automatically changing the color of items that are going to expire in the next day, automatically creating a separation between days of expiration, automatically moving expired items off the list, and automatically documenting all completed items.<br><br>It's great.

With the latter, I had to use two large books (because I was at the end of one book and the start of a new one). It was bulky and clumsy. Walter's app makes it lightning-fast. It was too easy to change focus with paper, and not write it down first, because that would have involved endless page turning. With Walter's app, there's no excuse for not writing it down first. Everything is accessible with the keyboard shortcuts. I can search for anything or add anything new almost instantaneously.<br><br>By the way. Thanks for the code.

I really like it.<br><br>I didn't have this experience with the AF variants.  Paper was better for those.  <br><br>Maybe it's working now, because pre-AF I was always prone to tweaking the system.

So, I like to have in front of me the task that I am currently working on. When I get interrupted I sometimes lose track of what it is I am doing. I also need to have ready access to today plus 7 days and today plus 1 month, so that as I think of stuff still to be done, I can enter it. Furthermore, since I review my lists so frequently, I know that there is a task that I want to do next that is behind the one I just finished. So, with paper, I spent a lot of time flipping through the pages. <br><br>If I was spending long periods of time on each item, I might have a different experience altogether.

Those were some of the reasons I liked electronic myself. I suspect however, that my environment is not as rapidfire as yours, at least not on most days. I have the one week and one month flagged out so entries are manageable that way.. <br><br>At the moment, if I really need to work on something urgent, I enter it at the one month mark, even if it repeats itself elsewhere. I jump from my current task, after re-entering if necessary, to the urgent task at the one month mark. After the "immediacy" is over, I re-commence at the beginning. I cross off the repetitive task if I come across it. Sometimes, urgencies force me to stay on the one month page as tasks come in rapidfire and are entered at the end of the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 March 2010 at 0:29 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Walter,<br><br>It seems to work fine at home with Vista.
