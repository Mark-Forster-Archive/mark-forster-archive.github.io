I have such a system, as I spend six hours driving on Monday and Friday. I HATE having to make calls while driving - I much prefer listening to podcasts, audible books and relaxing music.<br><br>I often make short lists on my blackberry for those times when I am away from the desk and not easily able to refer to my A4 notebook - shopping lists - lists of calls to make - list of things to bring from A to B etc. My AF pages are always the authorative 'master list', so I update them later when I get back to my notebook.<br><br>I also use my blackberry to note items that occur to me while in transit - adding them to my notebook later. The voice recorder on my phone is very handy for capturing tasks and ideas while driving.<br><br>What has NOT worked for me is putting the entire AF list on my blackberry - the moment the list becomes electronic I seem to spend more time sorting and slicing the list instead of actually doing anything. The inflexability of the written list seems to be a boon to me instead of a hindrence.<br><br>Respect<br>Paul</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2010 at 16:16 | Zytex aka Paul</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey, come on people!

There are those who visualise the person they are speaking to - and their likelihood of having an accident is greatly increased. And there are those who don't visualise the person they are speaking to - and they are no more likely to have an accident than they are when not using the phone. It doesn't matter whether the phone is hands-free or not.<br><br>Unfortunately I can't quote a reference to this. But the message seems clear. If you tend to visualise the person you are speaking to, you shouldn't use a cellphone in a moving vehicle under any circumstances.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 January 2010 at 14:04 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I promise you not to visualize :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 January 2010 at 8:22 | Eugene</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Eugene:<br><br>According to the article, if I remember right, it's a question of personality and not easily changed.

In fact - on a very long journey I fond having a conversation every now and then HELPS me stay alert and focused. Several hours on the motorway with nobody to talk to can make me tired.<br><br>Maybe I am rationalising. I do prefer to listen to music or an audio-book but notice that I am more alert after a lively conversation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 January 2010 at 10:06 | Zytex aka Paul</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As Mark says, it is a function of the kind of person you are.  If it helps ...<br><br>I'm a very visual person.  My internal experience of carrying on a conversation while driving is a little like going blind.  My vision switches from external to internal and while I am internally visualizing I can't use my external visual sense properly.  I takes a close call or something to snap me out of it.  For me, this also applies to talking with my wife sitting next to me.<br><br>We have had numerous debates on this issue (let your imagination run wild here ;-) as she talks on her cell phone for almost all of her 2+ hours/day commute.  She is better able to drive than I, but I'm not convinced that she does not also suffer some degradation.<br><br>After thinking about it it seems as if it is a particular kind of conversation that causes me (at least) trouble.  It is one in which I must solve a problem.  I can chit chat about things with my wife but when she asks the best way to get where we are going, I'm in trouble.  My mind constructs internal maps and I start working on the problem and go blind.  The trouble is that I'm driving when I go blind.  No biggie if we are on a highway cruising, but if I need to make turns or am in stop and go traffic, it can be dangerous.  It drives her nuts ;-)  And for me, the ONLY time I am on the cell phone is when I am solving a problem.  I don't get on the phone for fun ... I HATE it ;-)  Like as not it will be my wife calling to ask what's for dinner and that takes thinking ... or my neighbor asking me to pick up some things while I'm at the big box store ... and then I'm memorizing a list.<br><br>It turns out that we are all able to work in all modes of thinking.  I am more extremely visual, but I am also somewhat auditory and a little bit kinesthetic.  You may say that you are primarily kinesthetic, but you DO visualize to SOME degree and when you are doing that, you are detaching (to some extent) from the external world.  It is probable that the auditory and kinesthetics also do, even when NOT visualizing.  My reasons for saying that are speculative but they comport with my personal experience.<br><br>As to "hands free" phones, it turns out that holding the phone is only a small part of the distraction and so there is a small movement here in the US to stop ALL cell phone usage while driving.  The thought is that the carriers could disconnect the call and refuse to allow new calls (send or receive) when it detects that the phone is in motion (via GPS or cell tower triangulation).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 January 2010 at 13:07 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"The thought is that the carriers could disconnect the call and refuse to allow new calls (send or receive) when it detects that the phone is in motion (via GPS or cell tower triangulation)"<br><br>For the passangers, too? Or like when sitting in the train? And what about people walking and talking; they tend to bump into things when doing that, don't they? Hey, I just realised that there's a solution for all this - it's called a landline phone.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 January 2010 at 14:18 | JMTee</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Eugene, I found out that the strict Autofocus system didn't work for me when trying to make calls while driving. Nowadays I use a combination of Autofocus and GTD where basically GTD takes care of the project planning part plus provides some necessary contexts (like 'calls', 'errands' etc.), and Autofocus provides the main 'working environment' in the form of a one list, which I work through in AF4 fashion.<br><br>This all is brought together by OmniFocus which allows me to have projects and contexts for the GTD part and a custom perspective for the Autofocus list (only next actions in chronological order like they would be on a written list). So, while sitting in front of my Mac I use the Autofocus list, where the calls are just normal tasks to be dealt with when they stand out, but when I'm out and about (or driving) I have my iPhone with the synced data from the Mac and I can just select the 'calls' context and work from there. Best of both worlds, methinks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 January 2010 at 14:23 | JMTee</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
