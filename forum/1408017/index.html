That might work.<br><br>In theory, the SF list can grow without end, with the standard rules.   That could never happen in DWM because of the regular, date-based dismissal.  I'm attempting to address this.  SF is working fantastically for work, but my personal tasks seem to be growing without end, just like with AF.<br><br>Here's the essential problem, as Alan observed:   When the system starts to bog down because it has too many unactioned items and too many pages so you can't work through it fast enough -- the problem is self-perpetuating -- it just gets worse and worse.<br><br>I'd like to see some mechanism that self-corrects rather than self-perpetuates this problem.   When it starts getting too full, too slow, we need some mechanism that forces things to be cleared out much faster, and relieves the congestion.<br><br>This is the only thing I can see lacking with SF so far.   Still worth a Nobel prize, though!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 February 2011 at 23:32 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>My view is that the system has already got that self-correcting function in it. But in order to get that self-correction to work, you have to stick to the rules as written.<br><br>The self-correcting mechanism is Column 2.<br><br>So to take the example you quote of having to many unactioned items and too many pages so you can't work through it fast enough - what happens?<br><br>Because it's taking you so long to get through the list, you will need to increase the number of urgent tasks in Column 2. This will speed up the process of filling up Column 2.<br><br>When Column 2 is full, you have to take some action on every remaining task in Column 1 or dismiss it. Either way the page is now no longer active. <br><br>Faced with the pressure to action or dismiss all the tasks in Column 1, you may well take partial action on many of the Column 1 tasks, so again the process of filling up Column 2 is accelerated (this time with unfinished tasks).<br><br>Whenever you succeed in filling Column 2 of a page there is a knock-on effect on subsequent pages because tasks can no longer be entered on it - increasing the process of filling Column 2 yet again.<br><br>So far from there not being a self-correcting action, there is in fact one which increases rapidly after a certain point is reached.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 0:09 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>OK, thanks Mark.  This makes sense, and I expect I'll see this effect become clearer over time, as you have said.  I'll keep sticking to the rules as written and see how it goes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 4:39 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks again, Mark.  Here is a somewhat more elaborate response...<br><br>Just to clarify, and to be sure I understand you, are you saying that when Column 2 is filled up in this manner, it will accelerate the dismissal process, and in this way, the problem will take care of itself and the system will self-correct?<br><br>This does make sense, and I'll take it on faith that this effect will become clearer over time, as you have said.  <br><br>But often when I have found myself dealing with a filled Column 2, the threat of dismissal of everything in Column 1 makes those Column 1 items "stand out" more.  I find myself *working* on most of them, rather than dismissing them.  This tends to fill up Column 2 on subsequent pages, as you noted.  More than once, I've come awfully close to filling up Column 2 on every single page.<br><br>If I ever actually DO fill up Column 2 on every single page, then I'm not sure what to do.  I suggested a rule that I should be obliged to rewrite any re-entered unfinished tasks in such a way as to put them in Column 1 on the last page.  But your own advice in this situation was basically to give up, since the system is not working as intended.  <br><br>In any case, I'll stick to your advice, follow the rules strictly as written and see how it goes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 5:14 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; But your own advice in this situation was basically to give up, since the system is not working as intended. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I think my advice was actually on the lines of "You've broken the system, now start again from scratch and learn from your mistakes".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 9:49 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Don't the rules require you to keep adding column 2 tasks on the following page? &gt;&gt;<br><br>That was never my intention. But because I never envisaged Column 2 being filled before Column 1, I didn't write a specific rule about it. <br><br>However Seraphim persuaded me that he was more than capable of filling all of Column 2 all of the time, so I amended the rules to clarify.<br><br>&lt;&lt; Or did I miss a rule which restricts this to pages which have tasks in column 1? &gt;&gt;<br><br>You didn't miss it, because it wasn't in the original version.

If you do some of each now, you kill the next page instantly."<br><br>Seems to me that then you do need to put some smaller tasks on the list!  Let me take what's remaining on one of my middle pages as an example.  There's nothing open in the second column right now because when I left off yesterday I was working earlier in the list.  So:<br><br>-scoop cat boxes (one pass recurring)<br>-email CR re. conference (not one pass because it's a political minefield of an e-mail)<br>-order ink when there's a special (one pass once the "we're having a sale" e-mail comes through)<br>-email O (not one pass)<br>-interpret new correlations (not one pass)<br>-call DH to schedule appointment (one pass)<br>-who gets thank you gifts? (one pass)<br>-new blog post (not one pass)<br>-read koan (one pass recurring)<br>-prep Chapter 5 lecture (not one pass)<br><br>Next time I come to this page, at *most* 50% of these tasks will end up in C2 of the next page, and that assumes that I action all of them in one pass of this page (which I almost never do).<br><br>So maybe it's not just mixing up the size of tasks in your list, but also NOT working on every item on a page every time you pass that page.  Which comes back to the "little and often, at least once a day through the list" debate.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 13:07 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Odd, the above seems to be Mark disguised as Will responding to a post Will never made! &gt;&gt;<br><br>This is what happens when I start answering comments when I should be in bed!<br><br>It actually is Will's post, but in my delirium instead of copying it into a new post I must have pressed edit and then treated it as if I had copied it into a new post.<br><br>Sorry, Will!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 13:35 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Thought experiment: if all items on the Page are bigger than you finish in one shot, and if you intend to do all of them, then eventually all of them will move to column 2 of the following page.

Assuming you do insert the date at the start of each day, you could set up a reminder for, eg 28 days' time to dismiss everything on that date still not done.<br><br>However, this does assume that other tasks were being tackled on each pass. leaving behind a residue of un-tackled tasks on the reminder date, 17 Mar in the example.  I guess SFv3,if followed per the rules, assumes 28 days is more than enough to have sifted a column 1 page and that a 'nothing stands out' moment will come to pass.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2011 at 14:10 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Roger J:<br><br>Well, by chance tomorrow is Day 28 of my testing SuperFocus.

I was trapped in the batch of not-yet-registered folks due to Mark's illness (and Thanks Mark for posting the Skeleton-Service message so I stopped thinking that it was a problem on my end.) <br><br>I found SF just before the big 'complete' rules post was made. I'd heard of AF before but was always overwhelmed by the different iterations presented. I was excited that I was in near the beginning of something new. I started my list (for at home) on Saturday as it was the first day of a 10 day vacation (at home) and I had a lot on my plate to get accomplished. <br><br>I'm now extremely pleased. I was scared and frustrated at first because I was on one page for nearly two days and I saw no way I'd ever get to the end of my list. As the discussions unfolded here, I realized that this was due to both the artificial-ness that a 'new' list created with many MUSTS at the beginning and also due to writing some tasks as something too big. <br><br>Once I gave myself permission to make a quick pass through the list and make a few of the later added, small tasks urgent (ahead of finishing page 2) and changed the wording on my three big projects for the week, I started flying through things and stopped worrying that things near the end of the list would be forever neglected. <br><br>Thanks again to all the people who've posted similar issues over the past few days. I can't believe I have gotten so much done and I still have half of my vacation left!
