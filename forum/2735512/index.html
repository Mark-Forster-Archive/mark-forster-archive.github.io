All my previous systems usage has been a sometimes thing, so an always thing is a radical departure.  It definitely helps that Serial No-List is an easy system to stick to.

That's what I'm using too and, like you, I'm finding it easier to stick to than Simple Scanning.  It's very refreshing to start a fresh page every day - it reminds me of a saying I read about many years ago -  "Every day is a new life to the wise man".<br><br>To reassure myself that I'm not missing anything urgent from previous days, I have a task "scan full list" which I add every day.<br><br>At first I wasn't writing tasks that were part of my daily routine or that had a visible reminder (laundry, dishes, making meals, putting out the wastebin etc.) because I didn't want to clutter up the list with tasks I would do anyway even if I wasn't following a system, and also I wanted to keep to an open spread of two pages per day rather than running onto a new page overleaf.  That works fine on some days but on days when I need extra motivation I put everything on the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 March 2019 at 10:28 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm still using Serial No-List at work and at home. Even though my time to do things at home is limited, I still will write down everything on my mind and then scan through. I've also started writing little sentence completion stems now and then as the spirit moves me (ie, "To really feel good about today I want to ___"). I don't write a completion but I read the line and see what answers pop in my brain. <br><br>I also like the flexibility of the list in being a scratchpad of sorts, accepting tasks that flow in through the day.<br><br>At work, when I need to intersperse personal phone calls or errands with work stuff, I'm using (nuntym's?) technique of writing the work tasks flush-left and the personal tasks flush-center. I'm really liking it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 March 2019 at 13:42 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very happy to see Serial No-List is working well for you!<br><br>I've been sick a lot the last few weeks, so haven't been posting.

I am happy with the variety and timeliness of tasks I am selecting. Last week I had a variety of short high pressure meetings or projects, they got done as well a other work. This week is less structured, so I am interested to see how the Bounce does with working on longer-term goals and projects I hope to accomplish this week.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 March 2019 at 17:15 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Even though I made it easy -- every other day instead of every day -- it didn't work. <br><br>My plan was to write one or two words for each project each day, either status or reason I didn't work on it. The theory was it would show patterns and keep me moving.<br><br>I started the system on the week before the challenge started, and it worked well enough. The system naturally created the project "determine intermediate goals for projects," and I successfully resisted the urge to spend hours creating finely-detailed charts. One goal per week per project, with just enough detail to know if I was on track.<br><br>The next Monday (2 days before the start of Lent) was unusually tiring and I didn't catch up. After several days of writing variations on Tired or Exhausted, I didn't care to continue. Even though it was mechanically-easy to reboot, I didn't want to.<br><br>Also, a daily update of things I only expect to work on once or twice a week was a waste of time, even though it was only one word.<br><br>In hindsight, I wish I'd stuck with my original plan, which is an enhancement of my go-to system.. Start the challenge by setting weekly goals for each project. Start each week by setting daily goals. Perhaps add a monthly level. At middle and end of day / week, record success (failure) and reason, and adjust goals (and routine) as appropriate.<br><br>Also, record what I actually did, at 5-minute accuracy. Seeing the many 5-minute breaks add up, and how often they last more than 5 minutes, tells me either I really needed a lot of breaks, or I am procrastinating, or just making bad decisions. Include sleep, type of distraction, meals, weather, and other things that might affect productivity.<br><br>So, technically I'm out of the challenge, but I'm not giving up entirely just because I won't get a medal.

The general idea hasn't changed in years. It hasn't changed my life, or provided me with a "mind like water", and I'm ok with that.  &gt;&gt;<br><br>This really resonated with me.<br><br>Over the last few weeks, I've struggled. At first I was tempted to think, "Oh no, I've finally pushed yet another time management system to its limits...".  But then I realized, it's ME who has been struggling, not the TM system. I was frequently sick with a series of migraines; dealing with all kinds of changes at work; lots of stuff happening at home; etc. The struggles with the system were just a reflection of the struggles overall. It was obvious in retrospect.<br><br>Serial No-List put it all back in front of me like a mirror. Some of Mark's systems have worked like that, but not ever so clearly, or so simply. In the past, when I would get overwhelmed or bogged down, it always seemed like I could point to some dynamic of the system that was causing the trouble -- couldn't cycle the list fast enough; couldn't clear Column 2 fast enough (SF); couldn't get through my Final Version pre-selection fast enough; conflict between dismissing pages and attending to urgent items; etc. <br><br>I am sure the system crashes were really just the outcome of the real overwhelm. Mark has often said, you can't expect to fill your system with 10x the work you could possibly ever do, and expect the system to magically make it all happen. But the way it would fail, it was always some persistent conflict between the system rules, and what I intuitively felt had to be done.  <br><br>But with Serial No-List, there isn't any of that at all. If there's a lot of stuff I couldn't get done, it's just because there's a lot of stuff I couldn't get done. There aren't any other reasons. The system isn't demanding me to do anything. It's the work situation itself that's causing the pressure. So now I need to face it squarely and decide how to deal with it.<br><br>When I realized that, it left me with the same kind of feeling that Avrum is describing: ACCEPTANCE. <br><br>I feel like I am really getting somewhere.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 March 2019 at 17:08 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>&lt;&lt; It's the work situation itself that's causing the pressure.

In the past, I've always needed to break away from the system to get a clear idea of what's really happening and how to re-establish focus. I'm not saying this to disparage previous systems, but to observe that Serial No-List has this particular characteristic which is very helpful in my particular situation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2019 at 15:11 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I also had a bit of a realization looking at my SNL last night. I've been reading up on the "Life Admin" book that Oliver Burkeman wrote about several weeks ago on the Guardian site. As I looked at my tasks, I ticked all the tasks that were admin or maintenance related and which were creative. <br><br>Most of them were all admin-related. The non-admin ones were practicing my banjo (although that could also be seen as admin, I guess) and writing a blog post. The proportion is perhaps not surprising; most of our lives are taken up with admin of one sort or another.<br><br>It woke me up to the fact of how much of my evenings/weekends are spent doing admin and what can I do to open up more room for creating. Because in the end, I'd rather be creating and writing stuff than doing all this admin.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 March 2019 at 19:31 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Prior to the Lenten Challenge I had a very successful months-long run with Simple Scanning (SiSc) on pen &amp; paper.<br><br>I changed to DIT for the challenge, because I want to make DIT work for me with digital tools, something that never happened for me back then… <br><br>So far it works pretty well. Around the time Mark's last book came out, after I studied it (and I still do), I became good at time management. Which means, I am generally on top of my work, while creativity wise improving constantly. On a basic level: it's done. Mark solved my TM-problems.<br><br>So, digital DIT works for me by now.<br><br>What was striking to me, after working in the AF realm, which is the only truly working Someday/Maybe list I have ever seen, is how DIT makes sure that every atomic item in the system get's forced to be dealt with at some point. DIT seen as a maze doesn't let any way out for any "todo".<br><br>As advised by the book I took my old SiSc list as the backlog for the Current Initiative. I am still working on it. It is an interesting experiment in it's own right, because SiSc did "pre-clumb" the list. What I have here is a closed list which is pre-sorted by AF. I don't know if that is better, but it's fun to watch.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2019 at 11:00 | Christopher</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike Brown:<br><br>&lt;&lt; It woke me up to the fact of how much of my evenings/weekends are spent doing admin and what can I do to open up more room for creating.

Simple scanning is my preferred method, so the easiest solution I could see for me was breaking all the tasks down into batches of similar type tasks. That has worked out to be to about 40 separate long lists of similar categorised tasks.<br>New tasks get dropped into each appropriate list, so I only ever need to scan something once.<br>I can then manage them all so much better and I can see at a glance how long the lists are getting or the oldest task and take action.<br>So far so good.

These past days I did way too much impulsively. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Hm, interesting. There was a period of 2-3 weeks, in late January / early February, where I found myself deviating from my usual schedule, staying up late to work on things. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time, but it began to take a toll after awhile. "Stayed up too late last night!" started to recur on my list. 🙂  Eventually it self-corrected and I found a good balance. Actually I've found myself completely re-organizing my personal schedule as a result of some realizations I've been making during the process of using Serial No-List. Perhaps I should write a separate post about that.<br><br>But for now, I am wondering if the free-form nature of Serial No-List causes more of these kinds of excursions at first. The system is very freeing and seems to encourage new kinds of exploration. Maybe it should come with a warning label. 🙂 <br><br>Or maybe it has nothing to do with Serial No-List and we are just impulsive sometimes.
