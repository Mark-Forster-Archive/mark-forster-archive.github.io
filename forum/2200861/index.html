Just a remark: I cannot help myself, but I hear the irony in "I had to laugh at the way this ground-breaking new system". I must defend its author a little bit - As bullet journal has been quite often linked from many productivity webs in previous months,  I looked at it several times and I liked the approach. <br><br>Its author never calls it ground-breaking system. It is simple, common-sense way how to handle tasks. And why not? My idea was: yes, and why not, why should task management systems be considered complicated "inventions", counter-intuitive, wow producing approaches? It is not rocket science. TM system is "just" a way how to write down tasks, choose them, do them. OK, everybody needs different approach, but when something is common sense, it may (by definition) mean that it is what majority (can) use.<br><br>And I have to confess that I am returning more and more to "common sense" approaches when planning my tasks. Anyway, thanks for sharing it here. It is inspirational.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2013 at 12:15 | Daneb</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You're right, she doesn't claim it's "ground-breaking". I was amused to see such a professional presentation of a low-tech system, that doesn't try to sell us anything. You're also right that a system doesn't have to be high-tech to work. I've experimented with several, and always come back to a single low-tech notebook for my daily work. Simple, reliable, and can handle any type of note at any time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2013 at 0:24 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I believe it's he not she.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2013 at 2:34 | Ilse</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>GWMW<br>Please do post your digital version.

They both have the Index already in place. The Leuchtturm1917 has light grid dots and numbered pages and is the size of the large Moleskine. The At-A-Glance Planning Notebook has 31 numbered lines per page and is approximately 9" x 11".<br>I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and I love it for a lot of things, but nothing beats picking up a notebook and just seeing it all right there on paper.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2013 at 16:08 | whiteswan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sort of similar  - Patrick Rhone's Dash-Plus system:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://patrickrhone.com/2013/04/22/the-dash-plus-system/">http://patrickrhone.com/2013/04/22/the-dash-plus-system/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2013 at 19:34 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, Bullet Journal is a lovely system.

It's undoubtedly a fine effort in combining note taking with tasks, something I have wrestled with for a long time...A concern for me though is having potentially seemingly unlimited tasks buried amongst potentially many pages. Also, the provision made for a calander is not satisfactory (as noted above).<br><br>I feel it might overwhelm me personally. Let's face it, it also looks like a prime time opportunity for endless tweaking (no sarcasm intended), however it would be good to hear some feedback. In all honesty I have not trialled this method so am not speaking from any hands on experience.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 September 2013 at 19:30 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For years, I would draw a little checkbox in the margin of my notebook, to indicate the presence of a task.

You used an R for a new result ie goal, an A for an action you had to take and a W for an item you were waiting for from someone else.  <br><br>The truth is for the last six months I have not been using any system and recently realized it is not a good thing. I have way too many pads of paper of varying sizes on my desk and in my briefcase.  Enough things have slipped through the cracks that I am going to go back to writing in one place.  The problem I used to battle was that I like to be able to remove notes from my notebook and being left handed I don't like spiral notebooks and legal pads get messy.  <br><br>I am going to try a simple composition notebook and add an index so I can retrieve notes if I need them. <br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 October 2013 at 19:04 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As I posted a year ago exactly, this is a terrific system and is becoming quite well known: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1562027630/bullet-journal-journaling-at-the-speed-of-life">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1562027630/bullet-journal-journaling-at-the-speed-of-life</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2014 at 0:42 | whiteswan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I tried this system out for a bit when this thread was started last year, but I found I couldn't make it work at all.

In 2003 I ended up with several spreads of tasks per day. I found I my bullet-journal-type system to be too confusing, esp. the indexing. Got overwhelmed and started using GTD in 2003 (which I gave up in 2009).<br><br>If you don't add many tasks into your journal (like in the video), I think  this bullet Journal will work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 September 2014 at 13:22 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My system varies, but one of the early warning signs that I'm about to drop too many balls is when I start using loose paper rather than my Everything Books. (I have two. One for my purse, one for my desk.) (Either I feel overwhelmed and don't want to look at the Everything Book, or I'm over-confident. Either way, a warning sign.)<br><br>(Much as I love EverNote for archiving, pen and paper are still more reassuring for note-taking.)<br><br>Loose paper or a separate book works fine if I know I'll always have it when needed. Notes from my voice lessons live in a book in my lesson bag. Programming notes live in a file by my computer. However, if the right place isn't handy, the Everything Book works fine.<br><br>If the page looks like a schedule or todo list, then that's what it is. Each line is an action item. No need for special marks. Cross out when done. Dot on the left during triage.<br><br>Otherwise, action items get a circle on the left, and items I want to archive get a box drawn around them. Stroke through page when I can tear it out (once the other side is done). Tear corner when no action items but an item to archive might be lurking. (Yeah, dual system for archive. Box means I thought of it then. Corner is the final pass.)<br><br>I still struggle with "do at meeting" vs "do at home". Theoretically, a square box means do at the meeting, either as part of the formal meeting or during refreshments, but in the moment I often put a circle. I tried circle on one side for "at meeting" and the other for "at home", but kept putting them on the left.<br><br>Check through circle means done. (If no circle, line through text.)<br><br>"msg" and the date means I left a message, but item still open. Arrow through the circle means item copied to other list. (I don't cross it out, since crossing out feels like done.)<br><br>And my circles aren't very neat. About half an inch diameter.<br><br>++++<br><br>For indexing, haven't tried it, but looks useful:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.highfivehq.com/posts/a-little-known-hack-from-japan-to-get-your-notebook-organized">http://blog.highfivehq.com/posts/a-little-known-hack-from-japan-to-get-your-notebook-organized</a><br><br>The front (or back) page is the index, one topic per line.

I know what the aim is but I was wondering if you need to keep the pages consistent. Can I add a random page like a quote page in the middle of my weekly or daily spreads?<br><br>TIA<br>Emma</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 October 2018 at 9:47 | Emma</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I, like Mark have also tried the bullet journal, but abandoned it.  I actually bought, and am still using the dotted Leuchtturm1917, which I love as a notebook.  <br><br>I tried to work the system as described, but found that I was a slave to it.  Whenever I have a list of things I want to get done within a time frame like a day, or a week, or a month, then I usually don't end up finishing the list, and I feel like a failure.  So far, I am finding good success with simple scanning.  I have found over the years that I need a system that has low overhead to upkeep, captures everything, makes everything reviewable, and allows for maximum flexibility.  Still trying to figure out a couple of nuances, but so far, SS has proved way more useful for me than the bullet journal.  <br><br>I also think that the bullet journal can definitely work for many other people.  Just go to the internet and look at the many people that are successfully using it as evidence.  Why, I saw my niece-in-law setting up a bullet journal the other day.  She's 20, so I wanted to congratulate her on being wise enough at such a young age to carry a central repository of her tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 October 2018 at 15:27 | Cameron</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Emma, Yes, you can add a random page in the middle of the week in a Bullet Journal. The system is very flexible in what you record. The only things in that system that are not flexible are using it often, and experimenting as needed to find what works for you. There's lots of advice on the main site to solve common problems (threading, review, indexing, planning ahead). Many of the other sites are more about art than the actual system, but it's neat to see what other people consider worth planing and/or recording, and how they do it.<br><br>Cameron, If you don't finish the list for the day, then you're planning too much. That's setting yourself up for failure. I found time recording very useful. Some things took longer than I expected, so now I allow more time for them. Some things took less time, so now I resist them less. I wasn't giving myself credit for many of my accomplishments. Also, it showed me which distractions were safe(ish) (short, rejuvenating) and which led to wasted hours. If SS is working, and you're preparing well for future events, great! (I found I kept putting off things like buy present. Mon: Lots of time left. Tues: Still lots of time. Wed: Big meeting (prep, travel, stress, exhaustion -- all predictable if I bothered to think about it). Thurs: Unexpected emergency. Fri: Ooops.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2018 at 16:54 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi!
