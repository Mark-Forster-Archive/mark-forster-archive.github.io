There are days I only touch two or three tasks on it. I very often start something and drown in it for hours. So, in AF1 days, my active pages remained open for months, and only when I reached the end of the list - where the urgent tasks where - I was up to date and responding. I always postponed the "plunge" back to the first active page, because I knew I would be away from the end page with the hot topics for at least a week... unless I cheated, which I, of course, did. <br><br>Mark Forster himself is, without a doubt, a FAST mover. We all could see this when he introduced AF4, moving through his list several times in one day. As he explained, he was passing through his AF1 lists at least one time a day as well. We saw him completing a lot of tasks and touching even more. The point is, I simply can't work this way.<br><br>What I would like to discuss is whether this might make a difference in regard of which task management system works for a certain person.<br><br>For example, if you pass your whole list at least one time a day, you come across each task at least once: So you're less likely to miss a task that has become urgent. On the other hand, if you keep your tasks pending for a longer time, it's more likely they won't get dismissed too soon, but attacked when the right moment has come.<br><br>Is, for example, AF4 more suited for fast movers, while AF1 or AF3 is more for slow movers?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2010 at 14:17 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm not sure about that, but I absolutely must go through my full list once quickly so I know what's there.  I may do a couple small things along the way.  After this, I can do fast or slow, whatever I feel like.  But I'm not going to go slow when I know more important things are further down the list.  I'll get to the important thing and if it's a biggie I'll take my time then and there.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2010 at 19:28 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Andreas, <br><br>Are you running with one list or two? I have found it much easier to work through my lists since going from one list to two (home and work).<br><br>I am also experimenting with coding my entries P (plan) D (Do) R (Review) as I value this type of approach. Last week for example, 45% of my items where Review items. These were valuable items but individually they did not take long to work on - they just needed touching on. This seems to help me negotiate the list more nimbly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2010 at 21:26 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am somewhat in the middle in terms of speed going through my AF4 list.  I may decide to work on an entry like "work on project X" and spend an entire afternoon focusing on that one important project.  Other days I go more on a little and often approach.  I vary this based upon the amount of input and how much work ends up on my plate.  I am finding this to work so very well for me these days!  Autofocus 4 is the best!!<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2010 at 22:52 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>While I also work in large chunks, often two or three hours per task, I don't really move slowly through the list. Let's say I get up, sit at my desk and go through the list: hopefully, something challenging and important stands out. I work on it for two hours, after which I am a bit exhausted. Instead of taking a break, I might scan the list, looking for something easy that I could get out of the way. Then finally, the break. After that, nothing seems to stand out. Why? Because I get the feeling I might be missing something. So I scan along, only doing the one backlog task I have to do. Only urgent stuff would stand out. After I am reassured, everything might stand out and I would go down the list task by task. Then my mood changes again...<br><br>I found AF4 very flexible. I never feel like I am stuck in the system. I can go pretty much to any task (maybe touching the backlog on the way), any time I want.<br><br>By the way, I have the impression that there is much less talk about ›tweaking‹ the system since AF4 came out. Maybe the reason is that you can work your list pretty much any way you want.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 January 2010 at 10:03 | Olaf B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am doing something similar, where I spend most of the day on a few tasks.<br><br>This is a BAD habit.  Problem is that spending too long with 1 task results in a slowing down of velocity and becoming more prone to distraction.  Do you end up working on little unrelated bits and pieces while still ostensibly doing the current active task?<br><br>If you want to argue that your task is essential and you're working on it at full speed, why is it just 1 task?  What about breaking down the parts of it and putting it on the todo list?<br><br>I think that the AutoFocus system demands a higher velocity.  <br><br>LITTLE and OFTEN.<br><br>LITTLE and OFTEN.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 16:30 | Jim R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There are things you can't do little and often. You can't do a 2-hours-walk in pieces of 10 minutes. You can't cross a chasm in small steps, you have to jump. And some tasks demand preparation: You can't just get up from your chair, walk down into your garden and lay one brick on your wall-in-progress - you have to change clothes, you have to prepare mortar... So, it would be the opposite of being productive to do all this preparation for every single brick!<br><br>The same for some creative tasks, at least in my experience.<br><br>AF *can* deal with such tasks, but accelerating the number of turned pages per time unit is not the way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 18:30 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas:<br><br>Things which take a lot of time, e.g. exercise, piano practice, writing, etc, are often repetitive tasks - things which you want to do every day or perhaps three times a week. These are best dealt with by having time blocked out for them, rather than being put into a fluid system like AF (any version).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2010 at 22:04 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark<br><br>In my experience, scheduling the stuff you list is the best way to ensure I won't do it. Therefore, I accept that I probably won't practice the trombone more than once a week - but that's far more than not playing three times a week ... And it feels far better ...<br><br>Just another point of view ...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2010 at 8:45 | Lazy Cat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Lazy Cat:<br><br>I was referring to serious practice. If you are only practising the trombone once a week then you are not practising it seriously.There's no compulsion for you to take it seriously of course, but should you ever decide that you are going to take it seriously then you will need to start practising every day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2010 at 12:33 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>I fully agree that practising once a week is not taking it seriously - I play for fun and that's it. It's just about enough to keep the current level (which obviously isn't that high).<br><br>But I fear that I would have to come up with a very good strategy if I decided to take it seriously. Whatever I scheduled up to now, I found a way to procrastinate out of it. I get better results if I just put it on AF4 and accept that I might skip a day (for most of the stuff I really want to do daily, I manage to do it about five to six days out of seven). This includes stuff that takes at least 20 minutes to get reasonable results.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2010 at 13:13 | Lazy Cat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Lazy Cat:<br><br>&lt;&lt; But I fear that I would have to come up with a very good strategy if I decided to take it seriously. &gt;&gt;<br><br>But if you were taking it seriously you would have a lot more motivation. You would also presumably have some goals you were working to, such as exams, auditions, performances, etc. <br><br>I was speaking a few months ago to a fairly well known classical clarinetist, and I asked him how much time he practised a day and his reply was "Basically the whole day!"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2010 at 17:19 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>Most likely, you're right - but in that case, I still wouldn't schedule it but just do it because it's fun and AF4 allows me to do it now (the way I do a lot of other stuff).<br><br>My point was that scheduling as a tool for time management didn't work for me up to now. Instead, I start feeling forced to do something (which I would love to do if I could just choose to do instead of being told). I don't understand why. It's just an observation of the current state that lead to not using scheduling at the moment.<br><br>Maybe I'll get interested one day and try to figure out why it doesn't work for me, but at the moment, I just accept it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 January 2010 at 19:58 | Lazy Cat</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As a few people has mentioned, I think 'little and often' is the key here.<br><br>I'd also like to add that I 'tweak' Mark with a little bit of Boice - Mark says to work on something until you don't feel like it anymore. <br><br>Boice says stop before you're ready. <br><br>That would certainly help you not to get lost in something for hours. <br><br>(BTW I totally get your problem.

I paint with acrylics. I also make puppets out of all kinds of materials. And I enjoy making electronics gadgets and experiments. But the preperation time and the tidy-up time for these was long - and that was preventing me switching from one to the other effeciently.<br><br>So I set about reducing these 'tool-up' times. I keep several such projects 'on the go' in my 'workshop' (a corner of a shed). <br><br>I have found materials and techniques that prevent things 'going off' between my bursts of activity. And (most important of all) I have developed a system for keeping everything I need for each project all in one place so I can switch from one to the other in a few moments.<br><br>I bought a stack of baker's trays (one metre square ply-wood boards with a rim). I keep all my tools and materials for each project on one of these. I built a stacking system that allows me to simply slide the tray into the rack when not in use. So my tiny workshop is no longer cluttered.<br><br>So when I get the urge to do a little sculpting or whatever - I pull out the baker's tray with my latest work-in-progress (and all the tools and materials), pop it on my bench, setup my lamp, and away I go in seconds.<br><br>Before it would take so long to find the work, the tools, the materials etc. And the tidy-up afterwards was a pain - so it never happened. And as a result I avoided these projects for months at a stretch.<br><br>These days, when I get home from the office, I can get around to two or three of these projects before bedtime. Life is so much more enjoyable. And I dont watch TV all evening anymore.<br><br>Respect<br>Paul</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2010 at 15:17 | Zytex aka Paul</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good thinking, Paul.

I struggle with ADHD and procrastination.  AF4 is very helpful in keeping me focusing on the right things at the right time - when I am in the right state of mind for the given task.<br><br>On the other hand, there are definitely some things that I really want to do, such as learning Japanese, but I only end up spending one hour once a week on it.  My other projects tend to overwhelm my priorities a bit..</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2010 at 14:09 | Jim R</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
