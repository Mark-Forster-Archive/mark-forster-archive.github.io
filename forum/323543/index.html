My reasoning is as follows.  High volume users of the net are turning to blogs as they are easier to manage.  e.g My current blog reading would equate to &gt;100 newsletters!  With a blog feed I can skim and drop into what I want.  Low volume users tend to use newsletters rather than managing a daily blog.

If everything was posted to your weblog, then visitors can subscribe to your RSS feed to get all articles in their news feed reader - not a millions miles from subscribing to a newsletter - else they can read your posts in situ on the weblog itself. If you maintained a newsletter in addition to this then you're making more work for yourself, and for your readers who will want to make sure they can read everything.<br><br>So a plan would be to encourage people to subscribe to your news feed rather than your email newsletter.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:01 | David</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>B for me too please, I enjoy your newsletters but I'm not a blog fan, sorry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:06 | Helen P</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's got to be B, I use a handheld and email is what I have access to mostly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:09 | Tim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A very strong vote for B from me Mark</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:11 | Rob N</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Stick with the newsletter Mark = and thanks for asking.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:13 | sussan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, I read the newsletter but do not access blogs.And thank you for the newsletters so far<br>The newsletter also led to my purchase of your books<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:18 | jim bowes</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark<br><br>I personally would not visit the blog too often and would prefer not to have a huge email newsletter type thing.

You asked for my preference, but can I share an opinion that might help you make a strategic decision?<br><br>As a marketing communications professional, I believe blogs are ideal for exploring ideas, highlighting incidentals and jotting down thoughts. Critically, the medium allows stakeholders to interact and give feedback. Because blogs directly encourage dialogue, they can help cement lively relationships with a target audience (and by implication, help build brand).<br><br>This informality, where your audience can choose to view or interact at their leisure, suggests blogs might not carry the necessary gravitas for articles.<br><br>A newsletter mailing, however (opted into by the recipient) was presumably sold on the promise of supplying fully thought through presentations of insight and intelligence that can help change their lives. Nothing experimental; nothing explorational: just seasoned 'truths' that are known to work. For me, articles carry a kudos that says 'learning that should not be missed'.<br><br>And if there's something I really need to hear, I don't really want to wade through a blog to get to it.<br><br>I find this distinction in the character of the two platforms helpful and one that resonates with most people's conscious and subconscious perceptions. Blogs can give people with the time, space to reflect and think for themselves, whilst a newsletter can efficiently present perspectives they don't have to grapple with too much but can accept as fact should they choose to.<br><br>So, to answer your question directly, I would use your e-newsletter to carry articles (introduced in the e-mail but featured fully on your website should you need to drive traffic there) but also use the newsletter to add the odd intriguing or useful detail from your blog to win the interactivity you need to build your relationships.<br><br>Hope that helps! <br><br>All the best, Rob Wright (copywriter &amp; creative planner)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:25 | Rob Wright</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Scot Finnie, a writer for Computerworld who also does his own newsletter, explains here about his move from newsletter to blog that includes a newsletter with squibs pointing to the full articles.<br><br>Scot’s Newsletter Blog » Blog Archive » The Blogs Have It<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.scotsnewsletter.com/2007/10/07/the-blogs-have-it/">http://blog.scotsnewsletter.com/2007/10/07/the-blogs-have-it/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:38 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>B sounds good to me</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:39 | Alan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>B sounds best for me, Mark.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:40 | Pauline Hay</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>b please</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 January 2008 at 14:44 | lisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My instinctive reaction is to go for option c.

They both can serve two different purposes based on their stucture or you can treat them both the same. My idea of a blog is a free-form idea/feedback generator - a sort of freeform, stream-of-conscious survey of Planet Forster. Whereas the articles are the product of more rigorous, informed conclusions, ideas, plans and philosophy. In my view the two should feed off each other in a dynamic relationship.

You could use a blog software that allowed people to subscribe to replies to particular threads. From a business perspective, A) would remind people you are there, and encourage them to reconnect with the blog. I think you would get more mileage out of A) and since I visit the blog anyway, I would choose thoughtful, carefully written articles in a newsletter that don't appear on the blog. If I can access all your content anytime I want, for free, why would I bother keeping in touch? Think some of your articles on projects could easily be tke kind that would go in a newsletter. You could give people a "tip" on the newsletter contents when it does come out, and give them the opportunity to sign up, etc.<br><br>-Thanks for your work and <br>Best Wishes,<br>Gordon</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 April 2008 at 5:12 | Gordon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Email marketing, when done correctly remains to be the most effective internet marketing tool for small business.
