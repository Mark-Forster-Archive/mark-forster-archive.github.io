Since Evernote has been discussed more intensively latelty I did some more research.<br><br>The first thing I noticed is that there is a 3.5 beta out there.  I installed it and love the interface.  (But others hated it because it did not look like Unix LOL ;-)  In response Evernote says that the GUI is not final and will change ... so who knows?<br><br>I tested the encryption and found the following, yet again:<br><br>1) You CAN encrypt selected text in a note<br><br>2) You can NOT encrypt an entire note (at the note level ... which is to say you can encrypt all the text in a note at the text level by selecting all of it but not the note by selecting the note.<br><br>3) You can NOT encrypt images.  (This is true with a free account.  I understand that premium users CAN encrypt images but then they are NOT searchable.<br><br>4) You can NOT encrypt your entire database (on the Evernote servers)<br><br><br>From reading some of the posts I've copied here, it seems as if the data on your private PC is not all that secure and if you want it to be secure, Evernote says to not rely on Evernote to do it ... do it yourself with TrueCrypt.  What follows is a selection of clips from the Evernote user forum.  I hope it helps answer some questions.  It is pretty confusing because Evernote has not come out and published a clear description of how they implement security.  One has to ask questions and then untangle the (sometimes) seemingly contradictory answers.<br><br>(continued ...)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 October 2009 at 12:37 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(continued ...)<br><br>Someone asked, for the Nth time, about security.  The general feeling is that Evernote is dodging the issue by answering what is easy to answer and ignoring the real concerns.  You be the judge.  I'll start with this one:<br><br>=====<br><br>[Question]  If you search through out the message board (including this thread), you'll see Dave Engberg (Evernote) has responded regularly to the threads on security. They have always maintained they have the same level of security as email &amp; have never claimed to be a secure "backup" site where you should load all your sensitive data w/o encrypting it. However, that doesn't mean they allow unrestricted access to their servers, or have little/no security as far as accessing their servers go just as your email servers do not. And the chances of their servers getting hacked are minimal, just as with your email server, be it Cox, Gmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc. If someone were to hack into Gmail's email servers or AOL's email servers or Yahoo's email servers, any emails you have sitting out there will be viewable by the hackers b/c it is not encrypted. That is why you are not supposed to send any sensitive info via email. (Well, one of the reasons...not even getting into WIFI sniffers.)<br><br>EN does allow some encryption of text (search the message board.) But since you have to select the text &amp; encrypt it, if you do this very often, it's much more of pain than having an encrypted hard drive that gets backed up to a site whose focus is secure backup. <br><br><br>[Evernote responds with pointers to previous statements about security]<br><br><br>Security and privacy are extremely important topics for Evernote users, and for good reason. Evernote would like to provide a single service to manage your memories for many years. To achieve this, we must provide a very high level of system and data security while offering users a variety of choices to manage their own privacy requirements. Here is a high-level overview of some of the ways in which your data is protected by Evernote.<br><br>When you add a note to the service, it is secured like your email would be at a high-end email provider. This means that your notes are stored in a private, locked cage at a guarded data center that can only be accessed by a small number of Evernote operations personnel. Administrative maintenance on these servers can only be performed through secure, encrypted communications by the same set of people. All network access to these servers is similarly protected by a set of firewalls and hardened servers. Your login information is only transmitted to the servers in encrypted form over SSL, and your passwords are not directly stored on any of our systems.<br><br>We also offer enhanced privacy options that would not be available from services like email:<br><br>If you have sensitive text that you would like to remember (passwords, PINs, credit card numbers), you can encrypt that text in our Windows client (Mac coming soon) using a passphrase that is never transmitted to Evernote. This encrypted text can only be decrypted and read on one of your computers after you’ve re-entered the encryption passphrase. The sensitive text is not readable on our servers or on your computer by anyone who does not know the passphrase.<br><br>If you have some notes that you only want to access from a single computer, you can place these into a “Local Notebook” on our Windows or Mac client. Notes in a Local Notebook are never transmitted to our service, so they aren’t accessible from the web, or from your other computers. This may allow a greater level of privacy for some notes, at the expense of the accessibility and reliability you would get from a private note on the service.<br><br>Evernote recognizes that user choice is an important component of privacy and security. We believe that no single option is going to meet the needs of all users, so we aim to offer a set of tools that let people balance their needs for accessibility, privacy and control.<br><br>(continued ...)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 October 2009 at 12:39 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(continued ...)<br><br>This exchange which seemed to be getting to the point but then fizzled, IMO<br><br>=====<br><br>[Question]  I was re-playing the Evernote Podcast #8. There was an interesting question about security.<br><br>----<br>Question: Are the iPhone apps connections encrypted for Premium users?<br><br>Answer by Phil Lubin - Evernote CEO: <br><br>For free users, all your authentication connections go over SSL and are encrypted whenever you log in.<br><br>For premium connections all of your connections, all of your traffic to and from any client, are encrypted, including the web, iPhone, Windows Mac, Windows Mobile, everything.<br>----<br><br>Key word is connections. I believe that's the same thing as when you're doing your banking, you want to check your web browser to make sure the connection is secure. Whereas if you're simply Googling "pizza joint", it doesn't need to be a secure connection. Nefarious people can use "sniffers" to capture the data that's sent over unsecured connections, such as WIFI. The secure connection means that is either not possible or much harder to crack (not sure which.) This doesn't mean your Evernote data is encrypted/secure. IE, if someone were to hack into EN servers (small chance of that happening, but...it could), they would have access to all your notes. Or if someone stole your computer, they'd have access to all your EN files on your hard drive, unless they are encrypted (and not mounted.) <br><br>I have to admit, since I leave my desktop on 24/7 and use two encrypted drives much of the time, I leave them mounted 24/7. That does leave a security breach, but I'm counting on any thieves not sitting down at my desktop.  I figure they are going to quickly unplug everything, pack it up &amp; get out as quickly as possible. Once they do that, the encrypted drives are no longer mounted, so I'm ok.<br><br>[Evernote Responds]  Correct - like a secure banking site, we encrypt the connections via SSL so that someone on your network can't see your data go by. Your checking balance is not encrypted in your bank's databases, however, and your notes are not encrypted within Evernote. You can, of course, encrypt text in a note, or a Premium user can encrypt a file on their computer and add this encrypted file to Evernote as an attachment.<br><br>You can also password protect your PDFs which will give some security to your scanned documents, at the cost of no image recognition or indexing by Evernote.<br><br><br>[Question]  I liken this kind of security to a car journey:<br><br>At home the car's in my garage, protected by a gate, a locked garage door and a burglar alarm; I don't even lock the car doors. (Akin to TrueCrypt/BitLocker/FileVault...)<br><br>While driving I lock the doors, to prevent being carjacked in Glasgow   (Akin to SSL)<br><br>When I'm parked in my company's private (secure) parking lot, I lock the doors, enable the immobiliser and the alarm because I can't control who has access to the lot (rogue employee, intruder) (Akin to having an encrypted note, which Evernote doesn't really provide)<br><br>For me saying "use TrueCrypt" is like saying add another lock to the Garage door, that's not where my data's most vulnerable. And saying "Don't store sensitive data" is like saying leave the car at home, that's not where my data's most useful. I know that a determined car-thief can gain access to the company parking lot, and defeat the lock, alarm and immobiliser, but that's a lot of effort for a 8 year old banger. I'll take that risk because it's useful to have my car be mobile <br><br>My present solution is to password protect all sensitive PDFs before adding to Evernote, but I may forget occasionally. It would be fantastic if Evernote would encrypt all notes in a particular notebook, or all notes with a particular tag. In fact, I'm working on a AppleScript which will identify PDFs with the tag "secure" which are not encrypted and Growl notify me. Additionally I'll build folder actions which password protect certain PDFs then add them to Evernote. Unfortunately the iPhone cannot display encrypted PDFs, which is a bit of a limitation.<br><br>EDIT: Incidentally, as a Core Banking systems analyst, I can say that your Bank Balance may not be encrypted, but the relationship between you and that balance is not transparent. i.e you couldn't just search for your name or account number and see the balance. This is true at all the banks I've worked for where I would consider depositing money, there are others...<br><br>[Evernote Responds]  You sure make Glasgow sound like a scary place.  <br><br>Re: banks ... I don't want to belabor the comparison too much, but we follow a similar model with your data in Evernote. All identifying information about your account (username, email address, personal name, payment history, etc.) is stored in a secure user database that is physically separate from the databases that contain that data within your account. Your notes are just marked with a numeric identifier that says "user #1234678".<br><br>(continued ...)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 October 2009 at 12:40 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(continued ...)<br><br>I began to see that there was much confusion about what the security concerns were.  I felt that I needed to be as clear as possible about what MY concerns were, so as to not be shuttled off onto the siding by the Evernote staff.  So, I asked the following question to try to clarify the confusion.  I tried very hard to be as clear as possible so that I could get a good answer:<br><br>=====<br><br>Dave,<br><br>Firstly, thank you for your presence here, and openness in answering endless questions. That is not common among software makers and is MUCH appreciated.<br><br>I wonder if you could explain security once more. The explanations so far have my head spinning <br><br>I think the problem is that there are different "kinds" of security ... or maybe different "points" where security is an issue.<br><br>Your most often published information seems to focus on the areas of:<br><br>1. Transmitting information to and from your server and,<br>2. Human security at your data center<br><br>Much of the conversation in this thread has been about:<br><br>3. Security of data on the local PC<br>4. Security of access to the Evernote program on the local PC<br><br>The security concern I have, and would really like to see discussed/explained in more detail (or more clearly, perhaps) is:<br><br>5. Security of the data on the web.<br><br>IOW, if I have a picture of my driver's license and Passport and Social Security Card accessible to ME on the web, how accessible is it to others? (In the absence of my ability to encrypt a picture or scan.)<br><br>Now before you all suck in your breath in horror  consider that this is PRECISELY the way Evernote is marketed... as a place to upload and store ALL of your information so you can get at it in an instant. And it makes loads of sense to have that kind of information there. Suppose I'm traveling and I lose my wallet. Hey, I can get on to Evernote, anywhere in the world I have web access, and have all of my credit card accounts to call and cancel my cards, etc.<br><br>Even when it comes down to uploading a scan (or picture) of an airline ticket, do I really have to scour the document to see what kind of compromising information might have been printed on it? Can you see where that would make it problematic to just use, without a lot of fussing? What information CAN I feel safe uploading. As someone here said, if all you can upload is the trivial and unimportant stuff, who needs it? Sure I can upload business cards, no problem. Labels on wine or sake bottles? Go for it. White board presentations? YAY (But do rework that demo so that the flash does not obscure and make useless the information in the picture  But how useful is that in the grand scheme of things? I love uploading tagged photos. I love having business cards there so I can trash them. But I don't care about wine lables or white boards  What I really need is a secure home for my sensitive personal information that allows me universal access. THAT is the big attraction to Evernote. THAT is why, as much as I really love OneNote, It is not useful to me as a repository of data.<br><br>So, to reiterate, my question is: "How exposed am I to hackers trolling the Evernote website or trying to in other ways break into my Evernote account... ON THE WEB?" (Of course, assuming I take care choosing a good password and ID.)<br><br>=====<br><br>[After posting that and reading it I noticed that my Evernote UserID was attached to the question so I pointed that out (and, of course, it went unanswered)]<br><br>Ooops, reading over the question I just posted I now realize that my Evernote ID was necessary to post this question so that is one level of security lost to me. That seems an easy thing to solve, no? I mean, do we really have to sign up for a second Evernote account just to keep the primary logon ID secure? Or did I make some kind of mistake here?<br><br><br>[Evernote Responds (to the first part)]  Your data is protected on Evernote's servers using a layered set of physical and IT security technology and procedures. You can't see my notes for similar reasons that you can't see my banking information if you're online at the same bank as me ... our application was built from the ground up so that you can only access your data after you have affirmatively authenticated yourself, and you can only access it through controlled mechanisms.<br><br><br>=====<br><br>So, in other words: "Trust us."  Or perhaps: "If others don't protect your data, why should we?"  This does not leave me feeling good about Evernote's security.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 October 2009 at 12:43 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(continued ...)<br><br>Elsewhere, in response to why they don't encrypt data, <br><br>[Evernote says]  Unfortunately, if we only stored an opaque encrypted backup of your database file on our server, we couldn’t provide most of the features that our users love.<br><br>We couldn’t give you any web or mobile interfaces to access your notes. We couldn’t let you add notes via email/phone/Twitter. We couldn’t index your images for text searching. We couldn’t clip web pages via our bookmarklet Web Clipper. We couldn’t offer cool integrations from partners like Eye-Fi, Pelotonics, etc.<br><br>Basically, half of the great things you see on this blog would disappear.<br><br>I think that what you’re really looking for is just a hard drive backup service for a local application on your computer. You could do this with Evernote if you choose: put all of your notes in “Local” notebooks on your computer and then subscribe to something like Iron Mountain’s secure backup service to store an encrypted copy of your database file.<br>Thanks for the feedback.<br><br>=====<br><br>[When pushed further Evernote adds]  When I said that “we couldn’t provide most of the features” if we just stored a completely encrypted blob of data for each user, I was actually putting it mildly. To really achieve what you suggest, we wouldn’t even be able to implement incremental synchronization of your account, since this requires visibility at a level of granularity which would give away too much information about the contents of your notes.<br><br>There’s always a trade-off between security and functionality, and truly complete encryption of your account (so we can’t see any of the metadata or structure of your notes) just loses far too much of the functionality that you like. At that point, it’s not really “Evernote” any more.<br><br>There are a few options for people who don’t want the functionality of Evernote, but just want an encrypted backup of files on their computer. You can, of course, just make notes in Local notebooks and then back up your hard drive with something like Iron Mountain’s encrypted backup service. (There are others, but I’m familiar with this one from a past job.)<br><br><br>[Responding, another questioner points out]     Is it really encrypting the data? I don’t see the point of all this based on what I have discovered (I’m no security expert, but still this is enough to make me feel insecure)<br><br>I did the following:<br><br>1. Wrote a simple note with 2 checkboxes, with the text “FirstBox” and “SecondBox”.<br><br>2. Opened the database with Notepad++, and looked for these 2 strings. Interestingly enough, these text were all over the place.<br><br>3. Encrypt the text “FirstBox”<br><br>4. Opened the database again with Notepad++. I can see the “html” portion of the database shows the text is encrypted:<br>Pha2/hePKsU=<br><br>However, the string “FirstBox” is still searchable elsewhere in the database.<br><br>What is the point of encrypting the GUI side of it, when the database side of it is not encrypted (granted, the string’s location seems random, but still, it is in plain text. If it were to be a social security number, an intruder can recognize it easily).<br><br>I guess the best way is to use it is in USB mode, and put it inside a truecrypt container.<br><br>It would be nice if the database itself is encrypted — prevents things like “intruder copying the database file and enjoying the data at home”.<br><br>=====<br><br>And this observation/question has gone unaddressed since July!<br><br>(continued ...)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 October 2009 at 12:45 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(continued ...)<br><br>Elsewhere, when pounded by questions about the encryption of sected text they explain:<br><br>=====<br><br>When you encrypt text within Evernote, it is encrypted using a password-derived 64-bit key using the RC2 cipher.<br><br><br>Regarding the OSX user accounts, I'm not a Mac user (I know....blasphemy) so I'm not certain if it works the same as follows. Your mileage may vary....On Windows, any admin account can access any users documents folder by browsing to it. <br><br>Simply clicking on the EN DB there with an admin logon launches that information &amp; reveals all.....the password is only necessary to synch back to the servers. This is problematic if you work with a bunch of propellerheads (like me) and everybody knows the admin logon or a 'secret' way to get into your machine or how to jazz around with the Windows registry.<br><br>Using an encrypted volume is easy &amp; defeats these jokesters. There are online videos &amp; worlds of info on the details of using TrueCrypt, but here's how I did it. Create a TrueCrypt volume big enough to hold your DB plus some....give it some room to grow. This encrypted volume can be anywhere....like on a thumb drive, in the cloud, network drive, etc. Once the <br><br>TrueCrypt volume is created, mount it &amp; copy your DB into it since it works just like any other folder or drive. My new volume is setup as the P drive, so I launched EN, went into Tools &gt;&gt; Options and changed the EN Local Files option to point to this new location. Mine says P:\My EverNote Files (the database folder is understood it seems). <br><br>Now each time you want to use EN, launch &amp; mount your truecrypt volume first so that EN will have something to look at. <br><br>When you're done with EN &amp; have exited, just unmount the TrueCrypt volume to secure your data. You can also setup the TrueCrypt options to dismount at logoff automatically or start at logon, etc. Personally, I use a batch file that mounts the volume, starts EN &amp; then auto-dismounts when I exit EN. Everything is secure &amp; synchs &amp; all is well. If you're really paranoid, you can also go ahead &amp; start fresh &amp; install EN into this TrueCrypt volume so that it can't even be seen until the volume is mounted. That worked ok for me, but there were a couple of things I didn't care for, so I took that part out &amp; only pointed to the DB there instead.<br><br>=====<br><br>And again:<br><br>=====<br><br><br>[Question]  Evernote should consider being able to put a password lock on a single note. For example I want to keep my Bank Statements secured in Evernote. There surely MUST be an option for locking a note by password.<br><br><br>[Answer] Try using the search option. This issue has been brought up many times. You can encrypt text inside a note. You cannot use Evernote to lock a PDF note. <br><br>A quick and easy solution is to create a local notebook and store your bank statements there. The local notebook won't synchronize so only you will have access to it.<br><br>=====<br><br>And on and on and on it goes.

Within each of those servers, the data is stored on redundant pairs of disks for performance and reliability.<br>The servers perform a nightly backup onto another local disk, and then copy that to a nearline backup storage system. A copy of the nearline backup storage system is migrated offsite weekly. So at any given moment, each piece of your data is stored in between 4 and 9 different places.<br><br>And, of course, you can use the local client on PC or Mac to store your own redundant copy, which isn't available for most web-only "cloud" services.

A click gets you a list of previous versions of files.<br><br>As to DropBox security... here is what they have to say about security:<br><br>===<br><br>Your files are actually safer while stored in your Dropbox than on your computer in some cases. We use the same secure methods as banks and the military to send and store your data.<br><br>Dropbox takes the security of your files and of our software very seriously. We use the best tools and engineering practices available to build our software, and we have smart people making sure that Dropbox remains secure. Your files are backed-up, stored securely, and password-protected.<br><br>Nobody can see your private files in Dropbox unless you deliberately invite them or put them in your Public folder. Everything in your Public folder is, by definition, accessible to anyone. Otherwise, the only way to access the files in your Dropbox online is with your username and password.<br><br>Dropbox uses modern encryption methods to both transfer and store your data.<br><br>Shared folders are viewable only by people you invite<br><br>All transmission of file data and metadata occurs over an encrypted channel (SSL).<br><br>All files stored on Dropbox servers are encrypted (AES-256) and are inaccessible without your account password<br><br>Dropbox website and client software have been hardened against attacks from hackers<br>Online access to your files require your username and password<br><br>Public files are only viewable by people who have a link to the file(s). Public folders are not browsable or searchable<br><br>Dropbox employees aren't able to access user files, and when troubleshooting an account they only have access to file metadata (filenames, file sizes, etc., not the file contents)<br><br>Dropbox uses Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) for storage, which has a robust security policy of its own. You can find more information on Amazon's data security from the S3 site or, read more about how Dropbox and Amazon securely stores data.<br><br>Can I specify my own private key for my Dropbox?<br><br>We plan to eventually allow users to provide their own private key but for usability reasons (e.g. being able to view files from the web and share painlessly) we haven't done this yet.<br><br>Some users have mounted truecrypt volumes in their Dropboxes to handle this concern.<br><br>=====<br><br>[Mike's Observation]  This seems to be a pretty foolproof way of securing things... a TrueCrypt volume INSIDE of DropBox and your files INSIDE of TrueCrypt which is password protected by your own private password unknown to Dropbox.<br><br>If you decide to give it a try, use this link, if you don't mind:<br><br>https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTI1MTk0MDU5<br><br>Two good things will come of it ...<br><br>1) I will get an extra 0.25 GB of storage,<br><br>2) YOU will get an extra 0.2.5 GB of storagel<br><br>Not too shabby for just giving it a test drive  (Oh, and thanks to Jogesh and Ben for using that link.

It is the 900th time this has happened so now I am writing all posts (other than one liners) in a word processor.  What a waste of time this was!!!  I’m not sure I can complete answering this as I only have a few minutes before I have to take the car in for service this morning.  I may have to finish it later … yet again ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Bottom Line....does your dropbox keep a copy in the clouds in case your house burns down and you can't find your friggin' USB stick?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I answered this part yesterday … the bottom line is Yes, and it does so instantly and keeps a history of revisions so you can revert to a previous version.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   Currently, I keep a couple of cd's in my bank box and in my fireproof safe and switch them out more rarely than in prudent. *blush*  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>The rule is to back up as frequently as you would not mind having to do the work over.  (The mathematical purist in me must point out that, on average, over infinite disasters, it would actually be ½ of that time.  But who has time to let it average out over infinite disasters ;-)<br><br>To be perfectly safe, you should back up everything then log all changes, as they occur, to an offsite (cloud) facility.  You should probably also mirror everything on your own machine.  But we are talking expense that you probably can’t justify.<br><br>Here is one way that you could minimize your exposure, probably on the cheap.<br><br>1)	Assuming you are using DropBox (but there are other vendors which would work), set “My Documents” as the folder (and subfolders) that DropBox monitors.  It will copy any new files or changed files to the cloud instantly.)<br><br>2)	Assuming you are using MS Word, JUST for this example, set the option to create a backup file on open and set the location to “My Documents” … then when you want to work on a file, Word creates a backup copy, saves it in “My Documents” and DropBox instantly sees it and copies it to the cloud.<br><br>3)	Set the option in Word to log changes to a very small interval … 5 minutes, or maybe even 1 minute.  (If the interval is too short and you are typing quickly, there will be some delays as it logs changes every minute … or 5 or whatever.  So you might have to play with that.  Also set the location for the log file to “My Documents” and then DropBox will see the changes to the log file and immediately copy those to the cloud.<br><br>4)	When you are done, Word erases the backup copy and the log file and saves the new version of your document.  This is also saved in “My Documents”.  Dropbox sees the log file and the backup file being deleted and so deletes them in the cloud.  It sees the changed document that you have finished and immediately saves that.<br><br>5)	On some schedule that seems right to you, copy “My Documents” to a CD (or DVD if it is that big).  A DVD holds about 4GB and the free DropBox account is 2 GB (3 GB if the helpful people you know follow your link to referral) so if you keep things under control you should be fine with one DVD.  Maybe make two to be sure you have a readable one if you are super concerned.  Put one in your fireproof safe and the other in the bank vault.  Label them in permanent marker ON THE DISK ITSELF, NOT JUST THE JACKET with the date and what is on there.  Also make a directory listing and include it with the list.<br><br>6)	Printing a paper copy for your safe and vault will also give you yet another level of backup.<br><br>(NOTE: I have just tested the “My Documents” suggestion and MS Word, but have not messed with the logging part.  I’m confident it will work and will test it if requested.  Also note that I had to clean out “My Documents” a bit.  Stupid Windows saves “My Pictures” and “My Music” UNDER “My Documents” and they can be large subfolders.  Now why the hell would they do that?  It does not even make sense.)<br><br>What you end up with is:<br>1.	 A paper and digital copy in your safe and in a bank vault that is a week or so old.<br>2.	A current copy in the cloud.<br>3.	Versions of that copy in the cloud which track the history of the work you did.<br>4.	And if a crash occurs, recovery (from your own PC and the cloud) of work no more than 1 minute old (or whatever interval you chose).<br><br>Oh, and there is one more thing you can do.  If it is Word you are using, there is an option to turn on “versioning” where it will keep a history of changes for you … which will ALSO be kept in the cloud via DropBox giving you … what? … quadruple redundancy?  LOL ;-)<br><br>That is just one scenario.  You may use different software and so be limited by whatever features it offers.  But you can have whatever degree of protection you are willing to pay for, either in money or effort.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not knowledgeable enough to safely trust in the clouds without ME having control over the key.....plus...most don't offer the kind of encryption I need....The internet is filthy with thieves! As I stands now.....my highest trust is in 2 paper copies of everything. One in my home fireproof safe and one in my bank box. I have various computer things...but I just don't trust them yet.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Trust has to be earned, I understand that.  I think that you also have to do the calculation on the odds of your being hurt.  IOW, if you are storing something immediately convertible to cash (such as account numbers and passwords and PINS) then I see that as more of a risk than storing documents.  Thieves mostly want the cash and don’t have a lot of patience for stealing ideas.  Just how I look at things.<br><br>But remember that suggestion to run TrueCrypt UNDER DropBox.  I have not tried that yet.  IIRC, TrueCrypt is a bit of a headache to set up, but it does work well once set up.  I’ll go ahead and test that out … but not today.  ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I wonder if his Ironman backup offers bank level security.......hmmmmm (btw, I don't totally trust the banks either! ROTFL! Years ago, they accidentally gave my bank account to a new patron. He cleaned it out in a couple of DAYS....bounced checks everywhere...What would have happened if he knew my long term savings was attached! Oh Lordy!  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Some banks can be pretty dumb.  I am currently using BOA, and they seem alright.  OTOH, one bank, down the street, had a laptop stolen with all of the account numbers on it.  Now the BIG question is what are account numbers even DOING on a lap top?  They should only be on the bank’s secure server and never … FOR ANY REASON … be downloaded.<br><br>If a bank did that to me, I’d leave immediately.  It shows terminal incompetence.  But one thing I do now is to log into my bank’s web site every morning, first thing, and look at the transactions.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  My gratitude is that I did get my money back and at my *urging* they sent out apology letters. My greatest gratitude is that he was an uninformed opportunistic theif! LOL!  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yeah, banks are pretty good about that kind of thing.
