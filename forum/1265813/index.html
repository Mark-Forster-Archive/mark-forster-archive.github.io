Back in my college years, at ROTC (Reserved Officers Training Corps), "Invictus" is one of the poems we must memorize until we can recite them in our sleep.  I'm gonna memorize that again, forgot some of it already.<br><br>Thank you, JD!<br><br>Another of those poems is "If" by Rudyard Kipling:<br><br>If<br><br>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;<br><br>If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;<br>If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;<br>If you can meet with triumph and disaster<br>And treat those two imposters just the same;<br>If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,<br>And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools;<br><br>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>And never breath a word about your loss;<br>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on";<br><br>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch;<br>If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br>If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>With sixty seconds' worth of distance run -<br>Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>And - which is more - you'll be a Man my son! <br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Cricket,<br><br>I've read that before, and I really like it.   *sigh* I've wanted to read one of the "Dune" books, but I keep on forgetting to buy one.  Oh well.<br><br>Anyways, here is a shorter version of the litany:<br><br>"Fear is useless; what is needed is trust." <br> - Jesus Christ (Luke 8:50, Mark 5:36)<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>sabre23t, Erik, and Mark,<br><br>Yep! +AJPM+ is "Ad Jesum Per Mariam" (it is more correctly +AIPM+ for "Ad Iesum Per Mariam" as Latin does not have a "J," but anyways...), the motto that gives great confidence for me.  It translates into English as "To Jesus Through Mary," and it is the motto of those who have done the Perfect Contrition to Jesus through Mary, a way of devotion by Catholics.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Alan, <br><br>That's one weird song, but it IS inspiring.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Alan, Roger J,<br><br>You know, I have this stupid daydream sometimes that I was a musician/composer during World War II privy to much of Allied intelligence, and I'd compose this song for the D-Day landings to be played for the Allied soldiers before the invasion,<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VR1bOha40U">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VR1bOha40U</a><br><br>And I'd compose this for V-E Day:<br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCYr8TWAGn0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCYr8TWAGn0</a><br><br>But oh well ^___^<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Have anyone else found U2 songs to be very inspiring?<br><br>Beautiful Day: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co6WMzDOh1o&amp;ob=av2e">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co6WMzDOh1o&amp;ob=av2e</a> --&gt; A perfect way to start the morning!
