My challenge is going to be fighting my short attention span to follow the list. I know my attention span is garbage, so I'm not counting it as a failure if I get side-tracked by another thought but come back to the preselected list in relatively short order. A failure would be doing a bunch of things without going through the selection process, working items on the list that weren't selected instead of following the preselect, or going a day without going through the selection process at least once.<br><br>These are definitely challenges for me, but not impossible. Already, this system has been PHENOMENAL for keeping me working on things regularly and not letting things languish.

Exhausting as I have never worked so hard to keep up! Great system but it is a hard task master.<br>I'm doing real auto focus which is very simply - do, defer &amp; delete.<br>NB I'm enjoying very much my defer folder marked April 2020. It is filling up rapidly and I'm feeling great as life is a breeze. <br>Interesting to see if you can stick to DIT.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2020 at 15:21 | MrDone</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I so wanted to be lazy and not follow through on Saturday, but because of the challenge I stuck to it to end the day. I think today went better than it might have because of the continued effort. It’s still hard to be rigid but we’ll persist. Maybe 40 days of this will make a habit and the struggle will be behind me. Hope so.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 March 2020 at 2:50 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Still at it with Spinning Plates. Reminds me to stay focused despite everything that is going on around us. This system helps with limiting new projects. I am starting to see small progress on the 3 projects. They are big, I'm thinking of breaking them down to smaller chunks.<br><br>I do feel some things might be slipping through the cracks. Having this list of small, one off,  tasks is important for this system to work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 March 2020 at 19:51 | Erin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That is kind of the idea of Spinning Plates, isn’t it?  You keep doing the same thing without fail. Not a system I could follow, though. I’m having a hard enough time sticking to my system, which doesn’t demand I keep doing the same bunch of tasks every single day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 March 2020 at 13:32 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>&lt;&lt;You keep doing the same thing without fail.... the same bunch of tasks every single day. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Well, that's undoubtedly true of some tasks, yes. You keep on dealing with email, messages, paper, accounts, etc, etc, several times every day. The idea is to prevent backlogs building up or quickly clear them if they have built up. Most time management methods work on this principle or something approaching it.<br><br>The advantage of Spinning Plates is that it provides a check on how much work you take on, particularly as far as projects are concerned. You can only take on as much as you can handle at any one time and then you work on each project until you've achieved your immediate target - once you've done that you can decide on your next target. Provided you are up-to-date with your targets you can change the projects you are working on according to the rules.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 March 2020 at 17:25 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, that is how it is working for me. I’m using time blocking for the target right now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 March 2020 at 3:52 | Erin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alas, I'm out.

The last two days have been filled with me transitioning to working from home so I've written "Review this book!" as one of today's tasks. I've started using (I think) vegheadjones' method of flagging projects as a way to help me visually cluster tasks on the page.<br><br>I also find myself writing down thoughts, ideas, little twittery things that flit through my head. Not quite journaling but a place to pin those thoughts down when they fly by. When I sweep through the notebook I will highlight them before closing out the page with a big X in the top corner.<br><br>I've also succeeded in not listening to podcasts and my god has that been more helpful than I expected. Listening to longer-form audiobooks or music has sort of calmed my marginal mental activity so I'm a little less mentally jumpy.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2020 at 12:35 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike,<br><br>Glad you like the idea of #project tagging.<br><br>I like your idea of using the book for journaling and highlighting those entries so as not to be confused by tasks, I will try it.<br><br>Please share some audio book recommendations.
