I call it Random RAF.<br><br>I use a paper notebook as a catch-all list and I add a line with today's date. I use a randomizer that (as Mark recommends) has a max of the number of lines on a page. Then as you do in Mark's random system, you start at the first page and use the randomizer to pick the line the task is on. When you land on a task, you have three options, Do, Defer, or Delete. You must do one of those things. When done, cross out, add to teh end of the book if needed and continue from where you left off. When you reach the end of the book, you go back to the start. Crossed out items are "slides" which mean that the odds of doing earlier items are greater than later ones.<br><br>Why do I call this Random RAF? Aside from stealing the Do, Defer, Delete rule. I have one more rule, I do not leave my work until the day before yesterday is completely crossed out. But I have found I don't need to do it as a block or stop the randomizer because of the slide, those items get addressed a little faster than other items, and I have almost always cleared out that day during the course of my workday. On days where I have many meetings, that page may linger a day, but likely there will only be a few items not hit by the randomizer.<br><br>That's the whole system. I played with notation for must do today items, but I find it is not necessary, if the randomizer does't hit a priority item, I see them as I count down the lines on a page and do them when needed. <br><br>This balances everything I need in a system, enough structure, but unstructured, a system to keep the list manageable, and a  guarantee that items I don't want to get done or are important but not urgent will get addressed in short time.  I've tried the simple scanning ideas, but honestly, when I want to work I often get decision paralysis. Here I just look at one item at at time (picked randomly) and say, yes, now, no later, or no, never, freeing up my decision and scanning time to just do or no do.<br><br>Works for me!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 October 2017 at 21:28 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nice!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2017 at 6:46 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find this approach works fine, but skip the dice.  Just do an AF1 scan and pick anything that stands out to Delete or Defer.  If none, change the question to Do.  Carry on!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 October 2017 at 3:23 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The thing about the dice though is that it can remove/diminish resistance so I can see the usefulness of that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 October 2017 at 3:55 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here is my nascent theory on why randomizing is often superior to "standing out".<br><br>For decisions that matter, there is something about the random selection that triggers a faster, deeper intuitive response even than the "standing out" process. I think this is partially explained by the phenomenon of "revealed preferences" in relation to "flipism" -- see here for more -- <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipism#Flipism_in_decision-making">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipism#Flipism_in_decision-making</a><br><br>In other words, as soon as the coin toss reveals the decision, you know intuitively and blindingly fast if it's the wrong decision. It makes the right decision "jump out".<br><br>But I think there's an even deeper reason explaining how randomized methods make resistance disappear. *** For most tasks, priority really doesn't matter. ***  Trying to choose the right priority is usually trying to be more accurate than the noise.  It doesn't matter.  Any time spent on prioritization is wasted time -- except for the few decisions and tasks that really matter.<br><br>If priority doesn't matter, then ANY process, including the "standing out" method, that introduces prioritization overhead for every task, introduces waste and resistance into the system.<br><br>Taken together, it works really well:<br>(1) If randomizer chooses the wrong thing, you know it immediately, and can just go do the right thing.<br>(2) Otherwise just do what randomizer tells you to do. Better yet - defer, delete, or do. This gives you the flexibility to defer tasks that aren't ready for some reason; delete tasks that don't matter any more; and do.<br><br>So I am really interested in giving vegheadjones' new system a good try. But I'm currently doing something else with no-list that has similar effects. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 October 2017 at 17:46 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is it. I don't know why I didn't think of it before - the DDD really is helping keep the list to a manageable size and I have always loved the Random method. I find when I fully "engage" in the random method I'm automatically fully engaged in whatever task I'm working on. I've already seen an increase in the quality of my work and a decrease in stress. In the past when I used the random method, resistance would slowly build up because I didn't have the option to delete or defer tasks. I think this small combination of RAF and random will be wonderful. Thank for the insight, Vegheadjones! Seraphim, interested in your no-list system as well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2017 at 2:35 | Paul MacNeil</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think you are dead-on Seraphim with your post.  Prioritization is an extra layer of stress.  And I am the same way Paul, when I use the randomized and do, I am more engaged.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2017 at 3:41 | Vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Basically I've been using no-list for getting started on the right things for the day -- zeroing in on the top two or three things that really matter. <br><br>(I don't think the particular mechanics make any difference -- any no-list system will do. The point is to rely on your intuition -- you already know what you need to do, just give it a few moments' reflection before firing up the calendar and email and reminders etc. and getting sucked into the void.)<br><br>But then, when I would get tired, or interrupted, or distracted, and my intuition isn't working very well, I would do things like email, clearing reminders, clearing out action items from my meeting minutes in OneNote, and any other odds and ends that came to mind, following no particular system. And try to get back into a good flow with stuff that really matters. But not worry too much about the details, since I had already made good progress on the stuff that really matters.<br><br>This afternoon, I decided to try Vegheadjones' Random RAF when I got into that "tired zone", and it worked great!  The resistance melted away, and I got a LOT of stuff cleared. Even though I was tired, I wanted to keep going and going. Randomizer methods always seem to trigger that.<br><br>This can be their downside, too, at least for me. There is such momentum to charge forward, I don't want to slow down too much if I come to a task that requires too much time or thought. <br><br>No-list for deeper work, and Random RAF for more fragmented work, was a great combination today. No-list got me focused on the stuff that really matters when I had the energy and attention to focus on it and get it a good flow.  And Random RAF helped me be more systematic and resistance-free when I was tired and get a high volume of work done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2017 at 6:53 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim, <br><br>this combination of having a no list system for the important and urgent tasks and the long list system for the many small tasks might really help me to keep working inside a system. It resembles the situations which often appear (when using a long list system) where I feel that I cannot follow the rules of the system anymore (because of project pressure, additional unplanned work, etc.) and start to just follow my intuition. Then I get the impression that I have broken the rules, thus it becomes difficult to go back to the system. <br><br>In your system this is not breaking the rules but following the rules: Switch to a no list system when priorities are obvious, switch to a long list system when you have to do a lot of small things and when you need the "guidance" of the long list - and don't feel like breaking rules. <br><br>Great! I'll give it a try.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 October 2017 at 16:13 | Wowi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@vegheadjones: "...if the randomizer does't hit a priority item, I see them as I count down the lines on a page and do them when needed."<br><br>You can actually call that rule "Divert", i.e. divert from your randomizing/counting and do the urgent thing to be done. Therefore you have four D's, in keeping with the theme.<br><br>This seems really tempting, I'm going to try the system out.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 October 2017 at 6:27 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wowi I agree with you. If I feel that I must go against the system rules, I start to lose faith in the system, and ultimately this leads to resisting the system.<br><br>But lately I've been approaching it differently. My "system" is just to use my best intuition and reason and whatever other capacities I can bring to bear to my current reality. The method I use at any given time is a tactical decision. Using no-list for thinking, deep work, "current initiative" work, etc., is a tactical decision. And switching to randomizer is a tactical decision. Deciding how to manage my calendar and meetings is a tactical decision. I'd prefer to develop these into useful habits so the decision what to do in any given situation is more-or-less automatic, but still reserve the freedom to override my habits with whatever my reason and intuition etc. guide me to do. I think this is what we all do anyway -- but sometimes we wish we could just turn it all over to a simple algorithm completely. I wonder why we do that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 October 2017 at 6:37 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim, I think there are several reasons to do that.<br><br>One is clearly a morally upright one: better focus. You know it, if you have written down your stuff and put it over there, you can better concentrate on whatever we are doing over here.<br><br>Also, fear of doing the wrong thing.<br><br>Also, well, a lot of the things we have to do, wen don't really want to do.

I don't remember running across it before! <br><br>(I just held the pencil for 1 second without dropping it, each time, so I didn't find the exercise very enlightening. I'll have to try it with a more consequential decision and see what happens!)<br><br>In my obtuse post you cited, I was trying to say something like this: Sometimes we try to elevate a tactical method (such as algorithmic time-management systems) into a complete framework for our lives. But this has ultimately proven to be disappointing, or at least unsustainable. It doesn't get us to the point of revealing our deep intuitions, which is where we find the way to the most impactful results in our lives, as you describe in your Making Decisions article.<br><br>The No-List methods have helped me with this more than any of your other methods. I always like to start my day with this. It gets me in touch with the stuff circulating below the surface in my mind, heart, and gut, and helps me get it out in the open and make it actionable.<br><br>The Random method is also helpful in a different way -- it eliminates the decision and just elicits an immediate response. I think this is also a way of prompting our intuitions to reveal themselves. The responses are usually something like these, and they are immediate:<br>- "This is wrong!" -&gt; OK, stop and try to identify what's right<br>- "Delete!" -&gt; This isn't needed, get rid of it<br>- "Defer!" -&gt; I really can't do this right now - do it later<br>- "Do!" -&gt; Just get it done, and quickly!<br><br>I think this is even faster and more accurate than the Standing Out method. Perhaps the fact that it relies on random selection is obfuscating what is really happening under the surface. It is really working with your intuition in a deep and immediate way.<br><br>I always try to start with the no-list approach and sustain it as long as I can. But when my day is too fractured or doesn't have enough discretionary time, or when I just start to feel tired and "wandering", I've been switching to the random method. Together, these give me a "fast, flexible, systematic" combination that keeps me focused on the things that matter, and help me keep up with all the maintenance and little details that need to be dealt with.<br><br>The TOC Thinking Processes are really helpful here, too, especially when my intuitions are pulling me in different conflicting directions. They help verbalize the intuitions and put it into a logical framework so I can see what's really going on. This isn't meant to rationalize the intuitions -- coming up with the "reasons" -- but rather to clarify the logical dependencies and conflicts to help figure out what the intuition is really saying, validate the logic of it more rigorously, and pre-emptively identify and avert undesirable side effects of decisions and actions. The Evaporating Cloud conflict diagram is especially easy and fast to use, and has an amazing ability to resolve those intractable vicious circles.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 October 2017 at 5:20 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>By the way, I've been reading the book Messy: The Power of Disorder to Transform our Lives<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Messy-Power-Disorder-Transform-Lives/dp/1594634793">http://smile.amazon.com/Messy-Power-Disorder-Transform-Lives/dp/1594634793</a><br><br>It makes many observations relevant to this discussion, how randomness can be very healthy for sparking new ideas and solutions.

This puts pressure on the earlier items. It also puts tasks that I am still doing at the end of the list, in the case of the difficult books, it would reduce the probability of them being read again soon. 2) As you had said in your instructions for RAF, when an item is deferred it does not go on the end of the list but on the calendar for a future date. So if you landed on one of your 25 books and got a visceral "NO!" reaction, but you felt that you want to read it later, it should not stay on your current random list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 October 2017 at 21:48 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>vegheadjones:<br><br>I wasn't trying to construct the entire system, just enough to get a feel for what the decision making process is like in both cases in response to Seraphim's remark "I think this is even faster and more accurate than the Standing Out method."<br><br>Certainly it would now take a lot to convince me that Seraphim's method would be faster for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 October 2017 at 12:45 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim;<br><br>&lt;&lt; In fact, it makes me wonder, if perhaps "standing out" might be susceptible to "confirmation bias" and other self-reinforcing negative effects?

He says that they make antifragile systems stronger. Random stresses on fragile systems will break them, not strengthen them.<br><br>In fact it's relatively easy to break the Random System - I've done it several times. You just add more and more difficult things to your list and one day resistance will hit you like a sledgehammer. The system is fragile.<br><br>Now what happens in that situation with Simple Scanning? Nothing. The system will survive quite happily because you don't have to do any of the really difficult things - least of all at a difficult time. You just carry on with things you are capable of doing at that time. Simple Scanning is robust. Robust means that random forces won't break it.<br><br>It may even be anti-fragile since the more you use it and learn to trust it the better it works. I will need to work with it longer to find out if that is the case.<br><br>You're trying to get past the problem of the Random Method's fragility by introducing a triple choice. Do, Defer, Delete (DDD). But this triple choice was never intended to be used with every task. It was a means of clearing out tasks which already had been through a sifting process.

It's certainly a lot different than VegHeadJones' Random RAF method or my variation of it.<br><br>I have some ideas on how to do a more rigorous test, but need to think about it a bit more. And this post is already long enough. :-)<br><br>&lt;&lt; Taleb does not say that random stresses make systems stronger. He says that they make antifragile systems stronger. Random stresses on fragile systems will break them, not strengthen them. &gt;&gt;<br>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying too.<br><br>&lt;&lt; In fact it's relatively easy to break the Random System - I've done it several times. You just add more and more difficult things to your list and one day resistance will hit you like a sledgehammer. The system is fragile &gt;&gt;<br>I stopped using your original Randomizer method precisely for the same reason. The combination of Randomizer and RAF that VegHeadJones describes gives different results. I found when I combined it with No-List, it gave even better results (for me).<br><br>No-List always gets to the heart of whatever is on my mind -- whether conscious/rational or unconscious/intuitive -- and that has always had the same feel of "rightness" as "standing out" but taken to a deeper, more engaging level -- more visceral, more alive, more in-the-present. I think it uses the same positive mechanism as "standing out" -- recognizing the things that are important and valuable, even if I can't articulate WHY they are important and valuable. <br><br>One problem with No-List (for me at least) is that it can be mentally exhausting. When I'm tired, it's much harder to get going with it. Or sometimes I just don't get any traction with it -- it feels like I am having an "off day". <br><br>Those are the times I turn to Random RAF. It seems to engage the brain much differently. When it selects a task, I almost always just do it or delete it immediately. It isn't a deliberative or even meditative process at all. It's very fast. I can process 20-30+ tasks very quickly before I hit a task that gives me any kind of pause. Random RAF gives me an easy way to deal with it -- just defer it. It's probably giving me pause for a good reason. Once I realize I am pausing and deliberating, I just defer it and move on. This isn't so much a conscious decision as making an observation.<br><br>Actually that's true with almost all of this. With No-List, I am observing what comes to mind, what arises out of the depths, and writing it down where I can see it and intuit my way through it to decide where to focus. But even this "deciding" is really a matter of trying to find the thing that "stands out", that "feels right" -- again, it's a matter of observation, not so much rational decision-making. <br><br>The same is true with Random RAF (at least for me). I'm not *deciding* whether to "do, delete, or defer". Like I wrote above, if it's do or delete, it's just obvious, and it gets done. If it's defer, again, it's obvious (by the fact that I'm pausing over it), and once I realize that's what I'm doing, I defer.  <br><br>Also with Random RAF, I am doing things that I might otherwise not ever choose to do. Either because I just don't want to do it, or because it doesn't seem important, or whatever. But with Random RAF, most of the time, I just do it. Or it is now obvious it's not needed, so it's deleted. <br><br>I am trying to say that it selects different stuff than "standing out" does. It makes me look at things that would not stand out. This makes a lot of things get closure much faster, by either getting done or getting deleted.<br><br>These two approaches (No-List and Random RAF) work really well together for another reason. At the end of the day, I can look over all the stuff I've deferred -- it's easy, I just look at the last page or so of work. This gives my unconscious mind fodder to process overnight, so when I start No-List the next day, some of that stuff just comes up naturally and gets done. So later on, when I am in Random mode, I find a lot of that stuff that was deferred earlier, got deferred because it needed more deliberation and intuiting, and got handled appropriately during the No-List time.<br><br>Anyway, that's what is working for me at the moment. The key thing I am learning is how powerful it can be just to *observe*, rather than try to *decide*. I think Standing Out works on a similar principle, but it doesn't clear the dross as quickly, or process the boring stuff as quickly.<br><br>&lt;&lt; You're trying to get past the problem of the Random Method's fragility by introducing a triple choice. &gt;&gt; <br>I've tried to make it clear that (for me at least), it's not so much a matter of conscious choice, or "making a decision". If I find myself thinking about it too long, that means it's a "defer". It's more a matter of the right thing to do appearing almost instantly in my mind.  The change is that I am explicitly allowing myself these three options. <br><br>Following a "standing out" method can also work the same way, for all practical purposes. As you scan, something might jump out at you as "ready to delete". So it gets deleted. (Right? I mean, this is what you do also, right?) And then you carry on looking for whatever stands out. Things that *don't* stand out are deferred. It's not conscious -- it is simply how the system works. The items that don't stand out just stay there on the list, deferred at least for the moment, till you cycle round to them again. The Random RAF method makes this all happen more quickly, at least for me.<br><br>&lt;&lt; I suspect that you may have added to the system's fragility, but only time will tell. &gt;&gt;<br>You might be right, of course!  But in practice I am finding it to work in exactly the opposite fashion. <br><br>&lt;&lt; paralysis &gt;&gt; <br>There was lots of discussion on that. I don't seem to have a problem myself with this, neither with No-List, nor with Random-RAF. Both of these methods get me going pretty quickly, but work best in different circumstances, and using different mechanisms.<br><br><br>Not sure if any of this helps clarify what I was trying to say...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 October 2017 at 7:05 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>I was trying to get a feel for what your decision-making process felt like without having to construct an entire list.

Although you've repeatedly explained not to define it, to let the subconscious fill in the blank, the word still carries baggage.<br><br>What if instead of scanning for what we "want to do," we scan for what we "are going to do"? As we scan along, we wait for that special feeling of "Aha! This is what I'm going to do next," no "wanting" involved. We might want to do it or have to do it or need to do it before 5pm, etc. Of course, it's all "wanting" at a sort of meta-level, as the "Aha!" is a want-to-do, even if it's wanting to do this hated thing that we don't want to do, so that it's finally done. Literally true perhaps, but way too complicated!<br><br>I wouldn't expect this tweak to make much difference for you, because you probably discovered the Standing Out process before trying to verbalize it.

And it really is a blast from the past: AF4.<br><br>AF4 lends well into such a system since the Closed List naturally fits with "reverse standing out", where you need to be thorough, while the Open List definitely needs "standing out" because of the need to be flexible in handling urgent stuff which typically are found in it.  It has a natural landmark to signal the change from "reverse standing out" to "standing out", which is the dividing line, and vice versa.  Also, because of the thoroughness of "reverse standing out", you can safely switch from the Closed List to the Active List upon reaching the dividing line without going back to the beginning, and because of its speed (and let me point right now that it is amazing to find a process that is both fast and thorough!) there is little danger of the old disadvantage of AF4 where we bog down when the Open List bloats in size.  Finally, dismissal now actually makes sense and is even a natural consequence of the system, since once you have a pass through the Closed List without doing any task, what obviously will be left in the Closed List are the things you do not want to do.<br><br>1. Once you have a list of things to do, close it with a line.  Everything above this line is the Closed List, while everything below it is the Open List.  You can write new tasks into the Open List anytime.<br>2. Start from the beginning of the Closed List.  Do the tasks in order except those that you do not want to do, then cross them out when you have done what you can for now.  If needed, rewrite them at the end of the Open List. <br>3. Once you reach the dividing line, switch to the Open List.  Starting from the beginning of the Open List, scan down and do the tasks there that "stand out" as things you want to do, then cross them out when you have done what you can for now.  As always, if needed, rewrite them at the end of the Open List. <br>4. Once you reach the end of the Open List, go back to steps 2-4<br>5. Once you go through the Closed List without acting on any one active task, dismiss everything above the dividing line by drawing diagonal lines across the pages of the Closed List, then drawing a new dividing line at the end of the Open List, making it the new Closed List.  Be sure to review the dismissed items once in a while, for example by adding "review dismissed" into your AF4.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 October 2017 at 16:15 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark Forster - <br><br>&lt;&lt; [Random RAF is] not getting you any faster to the tasks that you do need to be doing now.
