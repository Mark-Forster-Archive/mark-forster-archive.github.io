Yes. But I've found - particularly with dreaded tasks a la applying for my birth certificate - that writing everything down a la FV, GTD, decreases urgency. I think this is because if feels as if I've done something, or enough of something, and the pressure is off.

The top achievers would commit themselves to a date for a poster or paper or whatever even before the data had been collected or analyzed. They knew that without that commitment and the pressure it brought, they would have spent more time analyzing the data and trying to make something perfect rather than just get it out the door. They were using the calendar to apply pressure to themselves. <br><br>For myself, I know that an aspect of my personality is that, if it's important to someone else, I'll move heaven and earth to get a task done. But if it's a personal project for myself and I'm tired, I'll postpone it till later. <br><br>So maybe what motivates you is committing to someone or something outside of yourself and your planner book? (You wouldn't keep a client waiting, after all.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 April 2012 at 15:32 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;So maybe what motivates you is committing to someone or something outside of yourself&gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, yes and yes. <br><br>&lt;&lt;You wouldn't keep a client waiting, after all&gt;&gt;<br><br>Exactly.

I guess finding the motivation blend of push/pull for each person is the secret. Although I am suspicious of the word "motivation" -- I'm never motivated to eat carrot cake, I just do it. So I think, for me, it's more identifying myself in some way with the outcome. I'm not articulate enough to define that vague idea further.<br><br>One of my PhD cohort said something I've remembered, that academics use time the way sculptors use clay. Time is a tangible substance they know how to use to their advantage; many of the academics I knew (and some of the principal investigators I work with now) have agendas that are years-long, and it helps guide their short- and medium-term decision making. (Tenure review, like an impending execution, helps to focus the mind.) That long view also helps them weather the setbacks and failures that inevitably come their way.<br><br>Here's maybe where Mark's "Dreams" method helps inform and shape how the FV list evolves and is used.<br><br>Here endeth the caffeine-powered afternoon daydreams of the everyday cubicle warrior :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 April 2012 at 19:18 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>You wrote that you &lt;&lt;hate&gt;&gt; #3 – fear/anxiety as a motivating factor.
