It's sort of a new fashionable take on productivity and it makes me very nervous. This is mainly because in my observation of others, those who have a goal and make plans to achieve that goal get things done and get their life the way they want it to be.  This inevitably leads to lists of tasks that need to be done and managed which of course is where time management and personal organisation comes in.<br><br>I've also observed that there doesn't seem to be one-size-fits-all to this. It's a question of finding or adapting a system to work for you based on some sound principles. We all look to Mark for the sound principles.<br><br>I suspect that others, like me, are looking for that secret golden gem of an idea that will magically transform us all into perfect organisation. Well, I for one don't think it exists (although I keep an eye out for it!), but managing ourselves and our tasks is probably just a question of following methodology that suits us consistently and diligently.  And in my view this is the hard bit.<br><br>Some people are born naturally organised and others have to work at it - I suspect that all of us that frequent this forum are of the latter group.<br><br>Just a few of my thoughts!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2012 at 17:20 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison,<br><br>&lt;&lt;Some people are born naturally organised and others have to work at it&gt;&gt;<br><br>I'm not sure that is true. I think everyone has to work at it. Perhaps it is more to do with upbringing and how organized your parents are. Nurture not nature. Perhaps those who *seem* naturally, inately, organized are more goal orientated -- they are people who have to be organized to some degree so that they can actually work towards their goals.<br><br>Goals are something to be aimed at. Once the goal is achieved, it is an achievement, not a goal.<br><br>I have never been particularly goal orientated, and until I was introduced to the marvelous AF1 I spent most of my time wondering what to do. So now I am more goal orientated, and I am committed to the goals, as a result of having a task management system that works.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 January 2012 at 18:39 | Wooba</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Some people are born naturally organised and others have to work at it &gt;&gt;<br><br>I think this is very true (I'm married to one of the naturally organised ones!)<br><br>But I think nevertheless that even the naturally organized ones use some form of system.

I know one or two naturally organised people (who seem reluctant to 'share' their secret!) and they just look at me in amazement when I question them, because what they do just seems to come naturally to them and they don't think about it.
