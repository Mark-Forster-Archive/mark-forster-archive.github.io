I've surmised that one thing is you don't keep up on the forum without a list. Why is that? My guess is you've associated no list with a vacation mindset. Am I wrong? I don't think of it that way and don't notice significant differences in my productivity in any one area. I was telling my dh about your trial without a list and we both agree that there are many circumstances that require a list. Obviously, there are individuals who do too. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 2:20 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good  question, Mel! I wish I knew the answer, because if I did I might be able to make it work.<br><br>However I don't think it's because I associate "no list" with a vacation mindset.

A GTD enthusiast could ask me why I can't make that work and I doubt that understanding it would solve the problem. Jacqueline and I were just reflecting off-list that we don't like the repetitiveness of things long-term. In other words, it's hard to maintain some routines without something new and exciting to keep us going. I was very conscious of the fact that the new versions of AF helped me tremendously. <br><br>In that vein, I have wished that there was a video game for time management. There actually is! It's called et to do on the iPhone. It just so happens that it's a really boring game. ;-) But if someone could develop one that has enough new "levels" and options to keep it from becoming boring, they might be on to something for personalities like mine.In lieu of that, I am trying to have a new big goal every so often. My current one is tennis. Somehow that makes the monotonous laundry not so bad.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 15:28 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel, the concept of a todo game application intrigues me. How exactly would something like that look to work for you?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 17:50 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey, Andreas. I like the concept of scoring points. So for example, I would score more points for doing tasks that I resist and want to do more often (playing board games with the kids) than for things I tend to gravitate toward and should do less (checking this forum). In fact, maybe for the latter I would lose points? It would require honest data entry of course.<br><br>The way et to do works is there are asteroids that pulsate quicker and come closer to you the sooner they are due. That's cool. But it's also pretty boring. I do best if I'm involved in some kind of competition. So if there were a board where we could compete for points and that kind of thing, I'd be all over it. The problem comes in with data entry, of course. I almost think you'd have to have upper limits on how many tasks you could enter or it would become so tedious that you'd quit using it. So for example, a limit of 3 tasks you're resisting and 3 you want to do more often. You wouldn't want to use it for absolutely everything you do or it would become like LifeBalance--a data-entry nightmare. Aside from that, I have no idea how to make it work!!<br><br>There's a little of the spirit of this in a chore game online. You can beat your housemates by performing more chores, especially more of the less desired ones than they do.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 19:16 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel and Andreas,<br><br>A lot of computer games work on the concept of levels. You have to get through the easy level before you can graduate to the more difficult level. Each level scores progressively higher points. Maybe one could do something on the same lines with easy tasks and more difficult tasks. Perhaps 5 different levels of difficulty. That way the difficult tasks actually become desirable targets to aim for.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 23:14 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good, and simple, idea.  Maybe something as easy as shooting for more points each day?  In Lakein's book he relates the strategy of one of his clients who made a game of trying to cross off his "bingo card" of tasks, completing every one, by the end of the day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 23:35 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas, a link to an article about productivity games. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/06/productivity-games-using-games-to.html">http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/06/productivity-games-using-games-to.html</a><br>Sounds like this is the latest and greatest thing.<br><br>Mike, I've run into problems with the "more points than yesterday" strategy.

In that time of "twilight consciousness" ;-) my mind races along some very odd tracks ;-) ;-)<br><br>This morning I was tormented by this game idea.  I've just recently been using the Eternity time logging application.  I asked myself why I was doing that.  Well, I find that time can get away from me if I don't measure where it is going.  What does the time log do for me?  It tells me how I've used my time.  What does that do for me?  It allows me to change how I use my time ... IOW, I try to get better each day.  What is the weakness in the software?  It does not present the information in a way that is motivating.  IOW, you just get a table of percentages.<br><br>How could it be better? <br><br>- Present the information graphically to give motivational feedback<br><br>- Allow me to set a target and tell me how close I've gotten.  (Ex.  Your score today is X which puts you ahead of yesterday.  Congrats.)<br><br>- Give interim results (Ex. Every time I change my time usage it could tell me that my day is x% finished and that at this rate I'll score Y points which would put me behind (or ahead) of yesterday by Z points and my best day was Q points.)<br><br>- Allow prioritization of categories of time usage so that I could get more points for better time usage and be penalized for wasting time.  (Ex. "A" priority time usage gets 10 points, "B" gets 3 points, "C" gets 1 point, overhead things (eating or sleeping, for example) get 0 points, and time wasting gets -5 points.  Very problematic time usage can get a bigger negative point value.)<br><br>A point to consider is WHAT do you want to train with this game.  If you want to train yourself to achieve better focus, the game could reward with points for each 10 minutes you work on the task without changing to something else.  If you wanted to train yourself to get the most important tasks done, you could prioritize the tasks themselves and work on a task basis.  If simple time usage is where you want to focus, then generalized time buckets (as in Eternity) would be good.<br><br>The game could also allow you to SPEND your points on rewards!  Reach 50 points and the program looks up a 50 point reward from your reward list and tells you that you can take a break and read a book for an hour ... 100 points and you go to a movie.<br><br>The game could also be more "controlling".  IOW, instead of relying on me to change my time usage (which I often forget to do) it could pop up a reminder at fixed (or random) intervals to ask what I'm doing.  It could even tell me what I SHOULD be doing, much like a calendar reminder program but based not only on appointments but on the value of tasks to be done.<br><br>Advanced features could include motivational quotations, music, cutsie pie pictures.  If your score gets TOO low, maybe the phone could deliver a shock?  LOL ;-)<br><br>If I had even the slightest urge to write software, this is the kind of program I'd go after ... and it would be an iPhone app for sure!!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2009 at 9:31 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Winner gets a free trip to the UK and a dinner date with Mark. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I'm not sure those are the criteria I usually use to select my dinner dates!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2009 at 10:18 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Remember the way in which we draw a vertical line to join contiguous crossed-out tasks?<br><br>Quite a good little game for the simple-minded (like myself) is to see how long a continuous line you can make.

A list of things that you enjoy doing with how many points they are worth.  Then, when you want to spend your balance (the program reminds you that you have reached the X points reward level ;-) you click somewhere and see a list of things you can spend your points one.

IOW, you are setting up the measurement parameters (yardstick vs micrometer, for example ;-) and the measurement is LOOKING at what you do in terms of what you wanted to do.  The "wanted to do" part is the task and the point value (or the time usage and point value).  The "measurement" is your subjective evaluation of how well you did.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  If it's just a side venture to stir up your interest and get out of a rut, then great. Whatever works! But I find it unsettling to think of living this way as a regular ongoing thing.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I think that many people have games they play to keep them going.  How fast, how often, how many completed, etc.  I remember one awful job I had when I was in school.  I was sorting sheet metal parts on a conveyor belt.  Not only was it boring beyond belief, but I got my hands all cut up on the metal.  Anyway, the only way I could keep my sanity was to see how far ahead of the belt I could get.  I raced to see if I could clear the area within my reach then take a short (30 seconds, maybe) break, let the belt catch up and get a little head start on me (LOL, thinking of it now, I was actually handicapping the conveyor belt, ROTF ;-) then I'd go into high gear again.  Simply "doing" that job would numb me into a coma and I'd probably wind up being injured.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  One reason I like AF so much is that it helps you figure out for yourself how you want to measure your success -- it helps you discover your values and align your action with those values.

With the right balance of professionalism, but with a game-like mindset. <br>Just like with real games - once you've reached your high score with no room left for improvement, the game becomes less interesting. So the game beyond the game is actually to have the ability to keep things interesting. <br><br>When I used to work behind a counter in my college days, I wouldn't focus so much on how fast or how much, but how fluid and classy I could serve customers. I enjoyed honing the little segments of action that happened when a customer came into when a customer would leave.
