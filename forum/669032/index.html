AF seems tailor made for my situation. I'm keeping a separate list for my BIG project and another one for HOME/ONLINE stuff, and I also have a weekly shopping list that's separate. <br><br>What I'm finding is the element of choice in the system really is a powerful shift. I'm no longer dealing with my "inner dictator" who tries to do things by sheer will power. In my case, this has led to a long rebellion, and the misery that inner rebellion always brings. So, the shift to working by choice and intuition is changing the way I feel before and after the day about myself for the better. <br><br>The other thing is that I find that I used to never check things off of my list because research work is inherently piece meal, and some items are never really done. But with AF I check things off even if I work for 10 minutes on it. Hence, I feel like I'm moving forward, and my inner critic is quelled by this.<br><br>By obeying your energy level and interest in a particular task, I find that I'm working with my mind and not against it all the time. I guess this is called wu wei by the Taoists. GTD never worked for me because it's a dictatorship and not wu wei. For those who who are rebellious it will never work. Working with AF allows you to re-conceive work from something you don't want to do, to something you're choosing to do. Mark has really hit on something huge here in my view. It's particularly well suited to those that work independently of outside structures in my opinion. <br><br>The other things I love about this system is the fact that it's low fi. I don't need to be distracted by another piece of software to manage my list. Personally I've struggled with computers as a huge distraction. Pen and paper for the main list, is a relief. <br><br>Finally, the other thing that works for me is "working the list", that is, with this system you are working on an item as long as you have energy or until friction builds up, and then you switch, but all the while you're working from the list. So, the list is front and centre. I've always had a problem making a list and then forgetting it or not really looking at it. This system has working the list built into it. Anyhow, those are my first impressions.

Reading your thoughts made me realize why this works so well for me - I loved your term "my inner dictator!"  We are own worst critics and you're right - this system addresses that and gives us feedback that we really are accomplishing a lot.  That energizes me and keeps me moving forward!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2009 at 16:34 | Mary</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh and I forgot to add that I also love the fact this system is analog.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2009 at 16:38 | Mary</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think one of the strengths of AF is the fact that the rules are obeyable. The approach of putting small win items on a list so that your mind gets used to the concept of having "done" items, may work in the short term but still leaves the remaining items which eventually get the better of us.  The fact that any work on an item enables it to be "done" means that every item is genuinely doable which makes completion possible rather than just "the impossible dream".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2009 at 23:23 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>What I liked about AF, as opposed to highly structured systems like GTD, is that I could start in with it within ten minutes of reading the rules. It wasn't one of those systems that was going to first require I survey my whole life, buy filing cabinets, etc., etc. -- not, in short, another big thing to procrastinate about starting. ("Yes, I like the look of GTD. I'll probably be starting it Monday.")<br><br>With AF, there isn't even bogging down on that most elementary step of prioritizing. You just jump in, the system sieves through and establishes priority on the fly.<br><br>Still loving it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2009 at 23:24 | Bill Adams</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Enjoyed the Wu Wei reference. Great read</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2009 at 1:36 | Peter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To add to Bill, I think the great thing of AF is that it incorporates intuitively all the actions which a highly structured systen expects from you into its simple process. Whereas in GTD you have to decide upfront what kind of action an item in your in-basket requires, in AF you just write it on your list and after some repetition of reading it you probably know what to do with it. Also the creation of the system (of your system!) gets part of the process: It started in my case with "Improve filing", and now I am continuously improving piece by piece my filing system. I like the "put into the system and then work to a decision what to do with it" approach of AF vs. the "decide and then put at the right location of your system" approach of GTD. That has kept me on top of my responsibilities and plans for longer than I ever experienced with GTD.<br>Wolfgang</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 February 2009 at 12:23 | wowi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Apparently there are 3 styles of wu-wei:  https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/trying-not-to-try-the-art-and-science-of-spontaneity/</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2018 at 15:31 | michael</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
