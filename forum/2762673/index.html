I was working daily on big projects which are either wrapped up or wrapping up today, and they were top-of-mind. So I was mainly writing down things I will need to take care of next week.<br><br>My other Lenten challenge to myself was not to listen to podcasts (only exceptions were my Doctor Who podcasts -- they go great with dish washing -- and my ambient music podcasts that I listen to while working). I've rediscovered my music library and Audible, and my attention feels less chopped-up and fragmented. Generally calmer overall, which is a nice feeling at this time.<br><br>The Lenten challenge has occasionally been followed by an Eastertide challenge but I have the feeling we all want to get back to experimentation and novelty!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 April 2020 at 15:31 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Congratulations Mike!  I'm not going in for experimenting myself.  I didn't have any other commitments over the Lent season, but I did commit to a 48 (47) hour internet fast from the end of the Good Friday online church service until the Easter church service today.  It was a great experience, got a ton of work done and a fair bit more deeper thinking about things rather than consuming information all the time.  It was difficult at times, but the fact I turned the Internet off and mobile devices kept me from splurging.  Anyway, I am definitely going to do more days of no net in the future.<br><br>As for the challenge, I passed!  For the first time ever!  My system was to follow a set of evolving routines every morning and evening.  (Part of those routines is planning the key activities I need to do each day.)  I didn't always execute consistently well, but I did always execute, which is amazing because I typically have been very prone to getting lazy and skipping a day here or there.  Indeed I was tempted several days but I persisted through them all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 April 2020 at 16:16 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I stuck with my commitment of using DIT supplemented with TOC to find a solution anytime I started getting behind.<br><br>Unfortunately it's been a difficult month or two -- I have had such a series of persistent migraines like I haven't had for a decade -- exacerbated by TMJ issues. As a result, I got behind a LOT. While I stayed on top of the most critical things, I didn't feel that the system was working especially well for this kind of situation. <br><br>I don't think Serial No-List would have been any better. It requires a lot of mental engagement to be most effective, and on many days, I don't think I would have been able to keep it going.<br><br>Mark, if you see this -- could you remind me what system you were using when you were recovering from your last battle with cancer and chemotherapy?

Was it Simple Scanning? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Ah... Frankly I've no idea. One of the effects of the chemotherapy was to devastate my memory and my recollection of the details of that time is very sketchy. However I would say that Simple Scanning would be a good choice for anyone with concentration problems because of its simple structure which has very little mental overhead. Though since I've never suffered from migraines I can't say from personal experience that it would work with them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 April 2020 at 22:08 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark<br><br>I believe it was “The Next Hour”.

I was productive and had the breakthroughs that are to be expected when one sticks to one system long enough to "blow up" the clumping of earlier tasks. But at some point I just stuck with it because I didn't want to loose the challenge two times in a row. So I completed it just to be able to say: Hurray.<br><br>My digital sisc system was a nice system nonetheless, but at one point I had enough, I don't know exactly what. I guess Mike Brown has it right in th OP. After the challenged I took a fresh paper notebook and started over with 5T. Now I am continuing on with FV.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 May 2020 at 14:12 | Christopher</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
