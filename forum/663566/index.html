One poster mentioned having a separate checkoff list for small daily tasks on Backpack.<br><br>Personally, I like the idea of having all my tasks in Autofocus. I don't like to recopy tasks either, but I don't have to, because I implement _the whole system_ on a free Backpack account. That means that when I complete today's houseclean I can just drag that task to the bottom of the last "page." (Now I'll explain those quotation marks.)<br><br>How to Implement Autofocus in a Free Backpack Account.<br><br>Devote one of your five free Backpack pages to Autofocus. Do _not_ use one page of Backpack for each page of Autofocus -- put all your Autofocus pages on one Backpack page by placing dividers every 25-35 tasks (whatever your page length is; actually, I like just 20--my only tweak to the system). This lets you freely select and drag tasks down to the end of the last page (division) instead of having to retype them.<br><br>What about highlighting? Not available as such, but two easy substitutions suggest themselves. <br><br>1. When you check off a task in Backpack, it persists in a small-type form at the bottom of that page division (that's right, Backup understands those dividers are marking a "page"), pending your actual deletion. This is a nice way to do Autofocus dismissals -- they're still there to ponder, but out of the way, immediately recognizable as non-active, and you can delete them permanently with a click whenever you decide.<br><br>Of course, if you're using the check-off for dismissals, then you can't use it for task completions. To complete a task that doesn't recur, just delete it via the trash can, no checkoff necessary. (Again, if it does recur, don't delete, but drag it to the end of your last page division.) <br><br>2. But suppose you like to see the struck-out completed tasks, instead of just having them vanish from the page via deletion. I completely understand that, it's motivating to see those dead soldiers (and sometimes the reminder of what you have already done may be useful, too).  Okay, if you feel that way you can do what I do: use the checkoff feature for completions of non-recurring tasks and set up an additional page division at the bottom of the Backpack page headed DISMISSALS. When it comes time to dismiss items, just drag them all the way down there, out of the way but still ponderable unless/until you decide to delete them.<br><br>I strongly believe that recurring daily chores belong in the Autofocus filtering process; recopying them all the time is the only downside, and with a Backpack implementation you don't have to.<br><br>Need a hard copy? Print from your browser. Need a backup? Backpack will email your page to you any time you request it.<br><br>By the way, with Backpack you can also take care of those future events / ticklers that don't fit in Autofocus. The Backpack Calendar function requires a paid subscription, but even with a free account you can set reminders that will be emailed or phoned to you and also sent to update any iCal formatted calendar application you use (and you can additionally keep a list of future events or the breakdown of major tasks into subtasks on a spare page; the free account comes with five pages). <br><br>Of course, Autofocus is so simple that you can implement it on almost any application that will take notes. (A Word document will let you highlight!) But after trying a zillion to-do applications, I keep coming back to Backpack for the simplicity and speed with which you can create tasks and drag them up or down. It seems a natural marriage with the simplicity of the Autofocus system.<br><br>Which I am loving.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2009 at 19:54 | Bill Adams</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bill, <br><br>thanks for the explanation of your system. As I'm a Backpack user too, and still looking for a simple, but portable digital solution for AF, I might give that a try.<br><br>Some additional tips: <br><br>* IMHO, you don't need dividers. Separate lists will probably do. You have to create those lists anyway.<br>* You don't have to drag the item all the way. While dragging, you can use the "end" key to go to the bottom of the page. You can also use page up/down keys. <br>* You can use the "Comments" function to write additional notes for your tasks. You can also add separate notes at the bottom of the page.<br>* And, of course, you can use links, which are easily written in Textile (example: "Mark's website":urlofmark'swebsite - the quotation marks are part of the code).<br>* With a paid account, you can upload supporting documents or pictures.<br>* You can colorize tasks using Textile (Example: %{color:red}this is the task description% - the color will be applied to the text inside the percent signs. I hope these code examples carry over correctly). If you want, you can use this instead of highlighting. I have AutoHotkey shortcuts for this. I don't know any 'catalogue' of colors you can use, but all the most common ones work. <br>* You can drag completed/dismissed lists to another page via your sidebar. <br>* You can email tasks to your page. They will end up in the first list on the page, though, so you might put a kind of 'inbox' list at the top. <br>* You can also get an XML backup of the page from your account settings. There is no import function, though.<br>* For Mac users, there's a free desktop application called 'Backboard.app' which might be useful (or not). However, it requires online access to Backpack to work. There's also a shareware app called 'Packrat' that will give you true offline access (however, it has problems with Textile). There are no equivalents for Windows, unfortunately. <br><br>There's a lot of other 'hacks', but tinkering with it too much will probably go against the spirit of AF (and since I know that I'm not only a procrastinator, but also a tinkerer, I'll refrain from setting up Backpack for AF for a while).<br><br>One caveat: I remember having once read about a 100 item limit in Backpack. I have been bitten by this myself when I ended up having emails (errror messages) bouncing back and forth after I'd hit the limit. I don't know if this is still an issue, and to what kind of 'items' it applies (maybe to entire lists, as you seem to already have more than 100 single list items, so those can probably exceed that number).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2009 at 21:07 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh, I forgot: You can embed your Google Calendar in a Backpack page in an iframe. <br>I only tried this briefly, and couldn't enable write access, but some people on the forum claimed it works. I prefer to have my Google Calendar in a separate browser tab anyway.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2009 at 21:12 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oops, forgot one more thing: You can *cough* chain multiple Backpack accounts via page sharing. However, there is only one free account per email address. Their ToS say, only one account per person. So, of course, I would never do that. :-X</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2009 at 21:20 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Most of what you say, though great Backpack info in general, Alex, hits me personally in the "too much tinkering" zone.<br><br>But you're right that the dividers are unnecessary -- I just think they're a good psychological aid to the "one page at a time" aspect of AF. And they take only a second to set up.<br><br>And you point the way to a major improvement in my scheme. If you can indeed drag tasks directly from lists on the AF page to a separate Dismissed page, that frees up the bottom of the AF page so that the End-Key shortcut takes a recurring task straight to its correct position on the bottom of the last (or active) page. <br><br>Or at any rate, this _would_ be a great improvement, except that I can't get tasks to drag to other pages in the side panel. I can drag them over there, but they don't go anywhere and blink back to where they started from..<br><br>What am I doing wrong?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2009 at 22:09 | Bill Adams</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nothing. You can't drag single list items to another page. You can only drag entire lists.<br><br>I've written about this over and over in the Backpack forum as a major shortcoming (esp. if you try to use separate pages as GTD 'contexts', which would be nice if you want to implement GTD, as I did by that time), but nothing happened. And don't expect it to change any time soon, as my requeste were met with typical 37signals 'style'. It's their way or the highway. The same goes for the flaws in Backpack calendar.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2009 at 22:22 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh, I see. You can't drag/drop individual tasks to another page, but you can drag/drop whole lists. So when it's time to dismiss X items from one division on the AF page, quickly create a new list headed Dismissed, drag all the dismissed items into that list, and drag that list to the dismissed page. Still nice and simple.<br><br>Thanks, Alex, I like it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2009 at 22:23 | Bill Adams</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(My self-reply and yours crossed in the mail, I see.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2009 at 22:24 | Bill Adams</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh, and thanks for your thoughts re dividers. That makes sense. Since you can't collapse lists (yet another shortcoming), this separation probably helps.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2009 at 22:28 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bill, <br><br>(yet another crossed-in-mail-post above, so this is in response to your post of 22:23)<br><br>sorry, but I don't quite understand why you *want* to move specific items. The instructions say that you should dismiss complete (AF) 'pages', so I assume you're doing that. Dragging the entire list to another (Backpack) page will do exactly that and not require any other action on the specific items in the list. It will enable you to use 'checking off' for tasks you complete while leaving the distinction between done and dismissed items intact on the 'dismissed lists' (Backpack) page. Most importantly, it will help you declutter your main 'AF' (Backpack) page, which will be of utmost importance once your (AF) 'pages' (= lists on the Backpack page) really start piling up.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 February 2009 at 22:57 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Duh, I didn't see the forest for the trees. Of course, yes, by the time we reach dismissing, that _is_ all that's left of an entire list, so the whole list can go in one move. Simpler and better than ever.  Thanks again.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 February 2009 at 1:39 | Bill Adams</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another thought came to my mind: <br><br>Maybe it's better to create the lists in *descending* chronological order (most recently created on top). This has two advantages: <br><br>- When you email tasks in, they'll go straight where they should be (to the end of the first list). <br><br>- You go through the (AF) 'pages' from bottom to top, so when you scroll through the active (AF) 'page' (= Backpack list) you're working on, you'll have the (AF) 'page' you worked on *before* that below (that list will slowly scroll 'into your view' when you move towards the end of the list you work on), not a newer page/list that might distract you more by containing something 'more interesting'. (I have difficulties to explain what I mean by this, I hope you get it.) This way you might get closer of the advantage of a paper page that feels more 'closed' until you turn the page over.<br><br>Haven't tried it, though.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 February 2009 at 20:29 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Another good suggestion, Alex, at least for people who post to Backpack via email. (I'm guessing this is mainly someone with a cellphone/PDA, which I'm not. Me, if I have access to email, I also have direct access to Backpack.)<br><br>My own latest tweak is to devote one of my free Backpack pages to a Project Breakdown page. Take any big items from your first AF page and break the down into smaller parts as a list, facilitating Do A Little Now and giving you something useful to do when you just have to tinker with the system instead of doing a task. At least this tinkering will eventually help you do tasks.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Bill</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2009 at 23:06 | Bill Adams</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
