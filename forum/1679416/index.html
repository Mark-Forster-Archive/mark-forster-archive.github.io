When this doesn't happen for me is when everything is right in my world. So when the home feels like a home (i.e. tidy and clean) , my family and friends are well and in contact, my projects and work are up to date, and I've found time for some 'me' projects in the evening.  So I guess we are talking about contentment or satisfaction.<br><br>I have to say risk-taking can be exciting, but I would never take a risk in my marriage - only in work.<br><br>I guess this may be related to age and we may have different criteria at different points in our lives.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 December 2011 at 10:59 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"What would need to happen today - both inside me and outside me - for me to regard the day as successful?"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 December 2011 at 12:27 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's an interesting question and I've been thinking about it for a while. The conclusion I've come to is rather like Will's: "I'll recognise it when I have it". Perhaps the essence of a really successful day is that you don't know what it would consist of beforehand. In other words, it comes as a surprise!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 December 2011 at 0:59 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark: interesting point. Perhaps acceptance and allowing leads naturally to a flow state - which is - perhaps - what AF aims to create.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 December 2011 at 15:11 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Perhaps a successful day is something that happens that sparks a special feeling of awareness - that you are really there; like falling out of a tree and coming back to earth.  <br><br>I've been cranking out quite a bit of items lately with the help of my notebooks, computer and iPad, and have even had enough discipline to process a boatload of emails and papers on the desk.  But is it already Tuesday again?  Wasn't it just Tuesday a couple of days ago?<br><br>This is not the first time this has happened, but the other day I was taking a routine walk to the store along a path that takes me away from any houses or cars; just greenery and trees and a few mosquitos. I never really noticed how the vegetation had been overtaking a fallen and rotting tree along the way.  That, in turn, caused a whole bunch of living things, including some butterflies and little flowers (with amazing designs) to blossom.  So, it made me stop, sit down, and look.  Then, I began staring.  Then I got a woof of an almost frightening realty; a strange feeling of really being there and really seeing this one little butterfly hopping around without a care in the world.<br><br>This might sound strange to you, but it was a surprise.  It was like being on a ship that rocks suddenly and you weren't prepared for it.  And all it was was an awareness.  It even made the colours and smells stand out, as well.<br><br>Where had my mind been last few days (or weeks)?  It made time slow down so that I could think about it.<br><br>How does this relate to a successful day?  This "mindfulness" does not happen often enough for me (but it never happens to others I know well), but sometimes when it sets in it can lead to other things.  It is a day "well-lived" because it permits me to come back to 'now' and make me realise that I already have so much.  <br><br>It can make me reflect, and permit me to feel myself breathe for a change.  It can lead me to wonder if I am striving to do too much, and spend far too little 'real' time with the family and the dogs.  Who else is affected by me not really 'being there'?  <br><br>So when I got back from my walk, my 'presence' was more valuable than before.  Heck, the tea even tasted better and I drank it without thinking about a million things.  I had been much too busy before I left.  How can I get this feeling to return after it is gone?  Maybe we should strive to learn how to bring on this type of awareness more often.  It certainly makes for a good day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 December 2011 at 16:48 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>BKK: Nice post.

This happened to me a long, long time ago (almost like a perception shift where even the colours seemed more brilliant and I could almost 'hear' nature) and I still remember it today. What I am not sure of is if we need the busy treadmill times leading up to it. We couldn't live in this perspective all the time else it wouldn't be 'special'. I'd just like to experience it more often!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 December 2011 at 0:07 | Alison Reeves</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>On Walden Pond.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 December 2011 at 0:56 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wow - thanks folks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 December 2011 at 1:12 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have actually never read anything about this 'awareness' thing, but I am sure there are loads of stuff available.  <br><br>I read "On Walden Pond" when I was young.  But I didn't mean to get philosophical; just wanted to answer the question.  I really believe this 'being there' really happens; where sights, smells and sounds are amplified.  I also believe that times like this have the benefit of introspection regarding things like perfectionism or spinning your wheels in your day-to-day activities.  Furthermore (sorry to repeat myself), if all of a sudden you realise your 'real presence' is worth 1000 x's more than any gift you could possibly buy, then it just might become a day "well-lived."<br><br>Living in a Buddhist country, I have met certain people (usually older, but not always) that seem to have a certain peace about them; a kind of a 'glow'.  It gives you strength just to be around them.  The few conversations I have had, though, have been more along the lines of developing a "quiet mind," rather than this "awareness" or "mindfulness" idea.  <br><br>Things, of course, are changing rapidly.  Now there is processed and fast food everywhere (I never saw overweight Thai kids a few years ago); people are learning English everywhere and super-fancy shopping malls are being built over torn-down markets.   Many of the kids in their cute, blue and white school uniforms on the tube are glued to their smart phones instead of talking with each other.  The old customs are being lost.<br><br>Whenever I do hear something meaningful from someone, it is usually something their +grandmother+ taught them.<br><br>I will review Michael's suggestion, thanks.  If I find some interesting links or books, I will pass them on, and start a new thread if I think they would be helpful concerning how we apply our time and attention (awareness), or anything along those lines.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 December 2011 at 6:21 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Didn't C.S.

It's one of the reasons I love walking. I get frequently surprised, even on routes I know well. A couple of days ago I said I'd walk over to a nearby village and meet my wife for lunch at the pub. On the way it started to rain hard, so I put the hood of my waterproof up and I was walking along listening to the sound of the rain on the hood, thinking "I should be miserable, but I love this!"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 December 2011 at 10:01 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; ' ' ' ' sound of the rain ' ' ' ' &gt;&gt;<br><br>That was great, Mark.
