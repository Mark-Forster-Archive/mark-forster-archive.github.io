The question gets you back to basics..." <br><br>Burkeman's own two things related to productivity: "About a third of the self-help books that cross my desk could be distilled to two things: first, if you can tolerate a little discomfort, you can achieve almost any goal; and second, it's amazing the lengths we'll go to to avoid discomfort."<br><br>My own personal time management 2 things would be (for today, anyway):<br>1.

No more zero days (A zero day is when you don't do a single thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on)  [I think this also ties in to things like atomic habits and "just get out the folder", little and often, etc. Personally, I have never been able to stick to doing a little of anything every day.]<br><br>2. Similar to what you said: Be grateful to the 3 you's: Be grateful to the past you for the positive things you've done. And do favours for the future you like you would for your best bro.<br><br>3. Also similar to what you said: Forgive yourself. [See ryans01's post for examples within this framework.]<br><br>4. Exercise and Books.  Exercise for future you.  "As for books, almost every thing we've all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else. Get some books. [...] [Reading] gets you to the next level that much faster." [I think the point of this rule is about what type of things you should spend your free time on, utilizing the other rules.]</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 August 2021 at 23:33 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1.

Eg every month I have a group of tasks that must be done be a certain date. I add 5 to the list each day and they are always done in time. A bit like a shredder- feed in 5 bits of paper and all ok. Feed in 20 and a jam.<br>One more point on doing things oldest first is that it only works if kept up to date. There are times when too much comes in and things get old so urgent/ deadlines can be missed. A quick switch to simple scanning sorts that out.<br>The main break through for me is being able to “just do it”</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 August 2021 at 8:15 | MrDone</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>MrDone:<br><br>I like the shredder analogy, speaking as someone who frequently jams his!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 August 2021 at 12:15 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>MrDone,<br><br>Like Mark, I'm intrigued by your approach (and a bit envious!). <br><br>Perhaps at some point you could share a few more details of your system. Is it one long list, worked FIFO (as much as possible)? Do you reenter tasks after working on them as in Mark's systems? How do you handle recurring tasks? etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 August 2021 at 16:42 | Belacqua</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Belacqua: yes it is pretty basic - long list, FIFO, try to do task in one go and planner/calendar feeds future tasks in at the right time. Simple as that.<br>Another benefit of fifo is that you can always tell if you are falling behind and either need to up the time input or reduce commitments. Also I can reliably let someone know when a job will be done. If things are done out of sequence it just pushes everything back. So great for planning.<br>I suppose I’m using Mark’s Do It Tomorrow &amp; GIRKIR principles and i have stuck to it since lent challenge. It has morphed into the simplest fifo system over time. I like the structure fifo gives me - no room for procrastination, going off at tangents etc. I don’t have a boss so no one to answer to hence I need something that keeps me on the right path.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 August 2021 at 9:04 | MrDone</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>PS if anyone wants a challenge try doing 100 tasks in fifo order.<br>It is extremely difficult, but hopefully you will clear something you have been putting off for ages and will feel so much better after…</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 August 2021 at 9:11 | MrDone</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>MrDone - re: "and planner/calendar feeds future tasks in at the right time".<br><br>This is something I always struggled with because I never had a good system for it. I'm now using Obsidian, and putting tasks on future days, rather than at the end of one long list, has made a huge difference. Especially near the end of the day when I need to add tasks that I know won't get done that day.<br><br>An Obsidian/FVP link is here: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2782894">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2782894</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 August 2021 at 13:54 | Zane</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>MrDone,<br><br>Interesting!

( <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html</a> ). A common remark is that it removes almost all resistance.<br><br>This is very similar to FIFO as the user has no control over the order in which they do tasks and just has to do whatever the system presents to them next. <br><br>if the Random Method works (which it does), then I see no reason why FIFO shouldn't work just as well. <br><br>However a similar method which works in much the same way but gives the user a lot more control over timing is the "Halving" method which i describe here: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/5/20/another-simple-and-effective-method.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/5/20/another-simple-and-effective-method.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 August 2021 at 21:32 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>I'm a fan of your Randomizer system; I've had some great results with it. I admit, though, that I haven't been able to use it long-term. I've found that after, say, a month, resistance to the compulsory task selection tends to creep in. But it's a powerful system, and I'll probably try it again in the future. With a second or third try one sometimes gets a different outcome (i.e., the problem is me, not the system).<br><br>I haven't tried "Halving" yet. As always, we're royally spoiled for choice here.
