Thank you very much! <br>I'll try the seperate post-it for urgent stuff (will at least keep  me on one system, rather than working on my urgent task list in outlook versus my AF list on paper). I'll also try scanning the list at least once a day (allthough I find that a lot of reading. Ideally I'd want to just read the important ones regularly whereas currently I'll be seeing my "save worldhunger" equally often). <br>And I'll try marking due dates in front of important/time-sensitive items, to make it easier to identify as items become urgent, which will hopefully decrease my anxiety of missing something important.<br><br>As for identifying what's important, I'm also an INTP, and fully relate to what Alex says. I've tried shortening my pages (by putting a line after a smaller group), to try learning to move to the next page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 7:25 | Karin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Karin<br><br>I would really recommend not trying to shorten pages as effectively that can increase the numbers of items you *have* to do before getting to those items you believe are important on a later page (in that you have to do at least as many items as numbers of pages between you and those items), and also reduces the number of passes before the system dismisses the item.  If you have 10 lines to a page the maximum number of times that item is looked at is 10 - on a 34 lined page it is 34.<br><br>Remember that you only *have* to do one item per page, and that you can break down tasks. Each time you see "Save world hunger" you are saying above that you just want to see the important tasks by which I think you mean tasks that you believe are urgent (and therefore considered important to you now).  It is usually our rational mind that creates that Urgent/Important grading - by working intuitively, AF enables the subconcsious to recognise what is *genuinely* urgent and important to us now - which invariably (at least in my experience to date) can be very different.<br><br>Try not to think too much about the items - or even why specific things are jumping out.  If each time you see "Save world hunger" or whatever project/s you have listed, the fact that it in some bothers you is maybe that is an indication to you that it is important and your subconscious is recognising that.  The fact that it feels like a big and seemingly impossible task does not mean it cannot be actioned.  You only have to do a small amount to cross off the task - and can then readd it or the next step to the end of the list.  That is how the lists keep moving - you are constantly cycling and recylcing and Mark has said somewhere that "the action takes place mostly towards the end of the lists".  That fluidity keeps things moving (progressing) rather than allowing them to become stagnant.<br><br>For example:<br><br>World Hunger could become<br>How can I help to alleviate world hunger?<br>What charities are involved in this field?<br>Which charities do I want to support?<br>Do I want to be more directly involved?<br>What organisations support/enable direct involvement? etc etc<br><br>Each task may just require a few minutes to jot down a few ideas or to research organisations but they are moving you towards the real question for you.<br><br>Good Luck Karin!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 12:42 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>I'm seeing more and more comments about the "rational" vs. the "intuitive" mind.  My fear is that this is getting to be something like the "mind v. body" problem.  Throughout history people have created artifical dualities and then forced artifical dichotomies.  Most often those have led to trouble.<br><br>In particular, I believe that it is failure to "think" about the nature of a proposed task that causes confusion about its importance and/or urgency.  From a naive point of view, everything is either urgent or not ... importance does not even hit awareness.  (In fact, some people have argued long and hard with me that there is no distinction between importance and urgency ... everything is both!"<br><br>More than that, importance and urgency are dynamic.  It is probably important to get gas when you have 1/4 tank left, but not urgent until the light comes on and one is on a long lonely stretch of country road.  Importance and urgency depend on the character of the person as well ... some live on the edge and let everything become urgent before they do tasks .. others are more conservative and make even minor tasks artifically urgent and do them well with limits.<br><br>Back to intuition ... I'm all for it.  I just don't think that is is anyway superior to thinking.  Those are different mental activities and both have thier place.<br><br>Thoughts?<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 12:58 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike<br><br>The latest scientific research tends to suggest there is no rational v. intuitive split. It's very likely we make almost all decisions with our 'intuitions' and only use rational thinking to justify those unconscious decisions. Thinking rationally around or about a problem is of course useful, but trying to make a rational decision about it is probably a waste of time as the decision will have almost certainly been made for you by your unconscious. We have far less control over our actions than we think. <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 14:12 | Kevin Geoghegan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Kevin <br><br>That's a really interesting post but certainly makes sense doesn't it?<br><br>Mike<br><br>Before seeing your post above I'd just done a (rather lengthy as usual!) post to the "Getting to a workable system" thread which may expand on my thinking.  I certainly take your point about artificial dualities but see our rational and intuitive "parts" for want of a better term, as just parts of a whole.  Both are essential - one without the other will lead to imbalance - and I think that it is fact that accepted thinking in the past has been to favour rationality to a degree that almost ignores the existence of intuition.  I think it is inevitable that, in the case where such a situation has occurred, the way to bring it in balance often starts with what seems like an overemphasis on the "forgotten" part.  I think that is partly the result of a need for a steeper learning curve to get a point of familiarity with that part.<br><br>I would certainly not advocate throwing rationality out of the window.  It is just as vital as intuition but I think our overemphasised use of it has led to articial feelings of either control or lack of control.  I think that by developing our intuition we will be able to make more effective rational decisions, because they will be based on true rationality rather than emotion, which I think has a lot more influence in our so called rational decisions than we would ever like to admit.  I guess thinking that last sentence through would support what Kevin said in his post. <br><br>I am certainly (I hope!) making rational decisions when I am relooking at my planning as a result of AF but perhaps approaching the process in a different way.  For example I have changed some of my filing systems and moved things around my office.  The location of my shredder was in "the rational" place but it was never convenient.  It is now in a different place which is convenient but not practical.  I am confident that at some point it will wander off to the "right" place and there it will live, but that right place will be the rational place albeit identified by my intuition.  Does that make any sense? :-).  I believe that my planning of projects etc is rational but find it easier to reach the right point by using more intuitive methods such as mindmaps in that planning/thinking process.<br><br>Hope that makes some sort of sense ......?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 15:52 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>Kevin is absolutely right in what he says.

But the quality of the decisions they make through that "gut-instinct" depends on how much they have dealt with similar circumstances before.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 15:54 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark<br><br>I guess that's the value of training - turning a rational but ponderous process into a fast, gut-instinct reaction.<br><br>Christine<br><br>I definitely agree that emotions play a big part in our thinking. I'd also be the first to admit that normally I over-rationalise and that is a big factor in indecision and procrastination. At the moment, AF is working just great. It's the first system that has proved really effective for me. I'm sure the constant reviewing has a lot to do with it. I never could face up to weekly reviews with GTD - it was just too much of a huge task in itself. The only downside I find about AF is that I am still getting feelings of lack of control like you mention. I think from reading some of the posts that some others are experiencing similar feelings of finding it hard to let go and trusting your intuition. Or maybe we're just control freaks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 January 2009 at 1:14 | Kevin Geoghegan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Intuition also takes place in the brain. It's just that less thought is put in to it than rational thinking. It's more like a guess. And, the experience you mention will help make it a guess with higher chance of being a good guess.<br>Where the upside lies when you use intuition, is that you don't spend time analyzing what to do next, mapping it out on a graph (important/urgent or any other). Instead you just get to work on a more random item. And, as a result you'll finish more items, and that's where the success lies. <br>After you've made a choice (whether that's based on intuition/guess or analysis), it'll always feel like the right choice, as that's what we convince ourself of.<br>In the end, in summary, for the analytical people, the instruction really should be instead of "take what pops out" =&gt; just take one and get on with it. It doesn't matter which one, it'll be the right one.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 January 2009 at 7:36 | Karin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Kevin<br><br>I know what you mean about those feelings of lack of control and have felt them myself but I think there are actually several factors involved here.  One is learned patterns of behaviour - I would imagine that most of of who have been in a state of overwhelm have just gotten used to that constant feeling of feeling out of control and that can be a hard habit to break, because it feels normal for us. I think also that we will have developed an automatic fear feeling which we naturally associate with a long list of tasks. If as a child we walk with our parents by a river, and they say to us "don't get close to the water, it's dangerous" we could start to associate "water" with "danger" so every time we we see water we think "ooh danger"!.  i think we have more than likely conditioned ourselves to a degree in the same way to see a long list of to do type items and think "ooh danger (lack of control)"<br><br>However I think that in some instances that fear may be true to a degree and the factors leading to it just need to be gotten out of the way.  If we have gotten ourselves into a situation where we are in the deep doo-doo, AF does not just pluck us out and put us somewhere else.  It provides the lifeline to enable us to pull ourselves out but we may still be stuck in that doo-doo for a while.  AF does however provide that lifeline and we will get out.<br><br>Of course I suspect there's also an element of the "control freak" about all of us that just loves to be let out from time to time :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 January 2009 at 10:40 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>You say:<br><br>"Kevin is absolutely right in what he says. We make the decisions first and then rationalise them afterwards. There is plenty of scientific (and popularised) literature to show that this is the case."<br><br>Are you saying that we always make decisions first and then rationalize them?  Are you saying that the scientific literature shows that this is always true?  I don't think either of those propositions is true.  If they were, then that very idea itself would be the result of rationalized intuition and you'd have to expect that my accepting it would also be a matter of my rationalized intuition ... so there would scarcely be any point in writing it here ... or in fact, even even discussing the AF system as we would all be deciding and understanding based on our intuition anyway.<br><br>As I see it, some of us have very little intuition at all (or, perhaps better put, are mostly deaf to the voice of our intuition).  Others are more finely tuned to it.  Still others act blindly on gut intuition, no matter the consequences, and seldom think about much at all.  I have seen little evidence that we are all the same in this, or most any other facet of human functioning.<br><br>You say:<br><br>"But what needs to be added is that "intuition" is a product of our life experience and training. Studies of how people like fire chiefs or pilots make decisions in desperate circumstances shows that they don't go through any rational consideration process. Instead they act from their "gut-instinct". But the quality of the decisions they make through that "gut-instinct" depends on how much they have dealt with similar circumstances before."<br><br>Yes, exactly.  Intuition is that it is a product of learning and experience.  If we try to act on intuition backed up by no experience we are in trouble.  But the experience has to come from action and without intuition, in the early stages, we must think our way through the process to build that intuition we can use later.  What is it that someone said: "Good judgment comes from bad experience.  Bad experience comes from bad judgment."  The trick is to think about what we are doing then evaluate our experience, thereby building the material upon which we can base intuition.<br><br>The second part of it is the USE of intuition to guide action.  That is also something learned.  I'm not sure it can really be taught, one just has to try and see how something works out, take feedback, and try again.  But in both the use of intuition and the content of intuition, there is a learning process involved.  Intuition is not simply an innate and infallible process that can be switched on by an act of will and the be expected to produce good results.  For those with little experience in using intuition, or little experience in the particular endeavor about to be attempted, the results of relying on intuition are likely to be disaster.<br><br>One last thought.  As I mentioned earlier, dichotomies are almost always wrong.  There is no split between the mind and the body ... we are a single organism.  There is no split between rational and intuitive ... they interact and feed into one another.  What's the old joke?  "There are two kinds of people: those who believe there are two kinds of people and those who don't."  I have found, personally, that anytime I build a dichotomous proposition I end up scrapping it.  And over the years, my scrap pile has gotten quite large.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 January 2009 at 11:19 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good Morning Karin,<br><br>I agree with most of what you say, but not your conclusion.  That last implies that there is no difference, therefore no consequence ... clearly there is.  If my intuition tells me to do something that leads to disaster ... then it was simply the wrong choice.  One can justify anything, but that is not really the exercise, is it.  It is not about feeling good about ones choices, no matter how disastrous.  It is about making choices which are not disastrous ... or even making ones which are outstandingly good.<br><br>And, once again, I think it might pay to make different distinctions about "type" of people.  I agree it is often a useful shorthand to think of "analytical people" or "intuitive people", but when it really is important to understand some of these things, that kind of shorthand obscures what is going on.  All of us analyze, and all of us use intuition ... it is a question of how much, how often, and in which cases.

I'm sure, however, that in the vast majority of cases, doing what "pops" is probably best ... assuming that one remains aware of the totality of one's context ... i.e. urgencies, deadlines, procrastination, etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 January 2009 at 13:58 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>The whole question of making choices and decisions is a fascinating one.

Are you saying that the scientific literature shows<br>that this is always true?"<br><br>A slightly more fitting theory in my opinion is that our rational 'conscious' facilities are called to evaluate possible solutions or decisions which are suggested by our 'unconscious' mind - what we call our intuition. However, I think the somewhat popular view of intuition as some special, rare facility (which only rears its head now and then and is inaccurate except in highly-trained people) is inaccurate. Intuition, to me, is all of our working mind, except the bits we feel conscious about. When you're playing chess, a series of possible moves are handed up to your brain, which you then evaluate slowly, consciously and logically. But where did the suggestions come from?<br>When you walk up the stairs, what makes you place one foot in a certain place and shift your hips in another direction? This certainly isn't in your conscious mind.<br>When driving down a quiet suburban street, what makes you pause suddenly, just before a poorly-visible child darts out from behind a parked car?<br><br>&gt; "As I see it, some of us have very little intuition at all (or, perhaps better put, are mostly deaf to the voice of our intuition). Others are more finely tuned to it. Still others act blindly on gut intuition, no matter the consequences, and seldom think about much at all. I have seen little evidence that we are all the same in this, or most any other facet of human functioning."<br><br>I don't think anybody lacks intuition - it is such a critical part of human behaviour and reasoning that we would be useless without it. If the people you're thinking of can walk, dance, play music or tennis or whatever, then they have enormous capability for intuitive thought, just like the rest of us. Only a very small part of our behaviour comes from what we call the conscious mind. In fact, there may be no such thing as a conscious mind - Minsky suggests that it might just be an illusion whereby our short-term memory systems simulate one linear stream of thought (when in reality there were perhaps thousands or hundreds of thousands of competing, co-operating agents contributing). However, there are people who do choose to ignore many intuitive suggestions and reason many decisions from first principles to some extent. This is just misguided, IMO, and a gigantic waste of brainpower :)<br>Note that it's very easy to overthink what should be simple decisions. See "Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart" by Gigerenzer et al for some examples of decisions that are better made with LESS information (i.e. fast and frugal heuristics).<br><br>&gt; "Yes, exactly. Intuition is that it is a product of learning and experience. If we try to act on intuition backed up by no experience we are in trouble. But the experience has to come from action and without intuition, in the early stages, we must think our way through the process to build that intuition we can use later."<br><br>Right, but if we do try to act on 'intuition' with no experience, we will almost certainly know that we're not doing the right thing. Intuitive processes aren't simply some black magic device where answers come from nowhere and we're left with no idea whether they are good or bad answers. They come directly from our knowledge, albeit not through some consciously-controlled process.<br>So yes, when you have no prior experience in some area, you must rely on other agencies not designed for the job, as well as conscious logical reasoning and observation to guide not only the task at hand, but your learning process as you build agencies to support the new task (which happens quite quickly - remember when you started learning to touch-type and feeling that euphoric sensation as you noticed less and less conscious effort was being required to type, and you were doing it faster? This probably happened within 20 or 30 minutes).<br><br>&gt; "Intuition is not simply an innate and infallible process that can be switched on by an act of will and the be expected to produce good results. For those with little experience in using intuition, or little experience in the particular endeavor about to be attempted, the results of relying on intuition are likely to be disaster."<br><br>Indeed - since intuitive thought obviously comes from our knowledge and skills, if we are seriously lacking in fundamental knowledge or understanding of a subject, we can't reasonably expect to make useful intuitive decisions about it (otherwise, intuition would be a mystical, infallible oracle demon which it is not).<br>However, by making such decisions anyway and observing the results, (even if we initially reject them repeatedly until we find decisions that we can rationally validate) we will build up such knowledge, even if we don't know how to express that knowledge clearly. That's what our brains do.<br>This is why I keep practicing the piano even though I was extremely poor at the beginning. If you never practice (which, in the case of music performance and most sports (where the agencies involved are far removed from our high-level 'rational' reasoning processes), involves learning things which are difficult to express in natural 'rational' language) you will not improve. If you do practice, you will improve, even if<br>you're not really sure why.<br><br>A great book which treats this topic is "The Society of Mind" by Marvin Minsky - well worth reading!
