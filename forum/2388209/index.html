Trash, merge-and-purge, move to long-term storage, do the next stage of the project, whatever. "If I don't feel like doing it now, I won't feel like doing it later, ever."<br><br>If the file isn't finished (as far as I can, not just until I'm bored), it's returned to the back. That makes makes me do it tomorrow, and keep momentum. So far, I've only used that rule once. Most files are ridiculously easy to deal with once I set my mind to it.<br><br>Tweaks and observations:<br><br>This is really powerful if I do it after working on a previous not-just-yet pile that became a backlog. A reminder why I should deal with the files and not game the system.<br><br>If I want to keep a file another month or two, but it's not worthy of a home of its own, move it to the front so it goes around again. This does not count as the daily file dealt with. There are a few things like that in the system. Previously, they'd clutter up my desk, or I'd make a home for them and then forget where.<br><br>Keep an eye on the amount of low-urgency reading in the system. It works great for just a bit, but too much will clog it.<br><br>Every few days, I put in a little surprise, such as a thought for the day or a picture. Not too often, or they become clutter.<br><br>Use flags and/or coloured folders on frequently-used folders. (Obvious in hindsight.)<br><br>Add a flag each week, to ensure I'm clearing out a week's worth each week.<br><br>I'm worried that there might be files that get used just often enough to never reach the back, that just grow and grow, that fall through the cracks. I haven't found any like that so far, but I'll stay alert for them.<br><br>I tried tweaking it by putting an urgent file at the back, so I dealt with it first thing next day. Not a good idea. It broke the "one old thing each day" pattern. Part of the power of this keeping momentum on the back-end.<br><br>+++<br><br>Like I said, so far I'm happy. For whatever reason, I find it easier to purge a project file a few weeks after finishing the project, and this system lets things sit just long enough. Projects that I'm not looking forward to eventually make it to the back and get dealt with.<br><br>We'll see how it works over the next few months, especially when recovering from our next vacation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2014 at 20:36 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cricket:<br><br>As I understand it you are using a "replace on the left, weed from the right" system.<br><br>This is good for purging dead files, but it doesn't really help with the problem of keeping constantly used files well weeded. So for me the biggest files (in terms of content) are the ones on the left (i.e. the one's most recently used).<br><br>Do you have a method for dealing with these files?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 July 2014 at 9:58 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's right, with LAO weeding. The daily LAO weeding is important!<br><br>Yes, I am worried about files that are constantly used, but so far it hasn't become a problem. In part, that's because I already have systems for dealing with most of them. (Not necessarily good systems, yet. Baby steps.)<br><br>Most of my projects are only active for a few months, so they aren't in the system very long. Longer projects already have homes elsewhere (and most of them aren't currently active).<br><br>One idea for large files that never get purged because they keep getting moved to the front is to subdivide them. Many of the sub-files will make their way to the back and be ready for tidying (and even moving from active to reference).<br><br>Boring and frequent filing already has a home by my desk, which is tidied and moved to long-term storage (or trash) every year. Since next year's filing needs room on the same shelf, there's incentive to deal with it on time.<br><br>I'm still brainstorming about things that are delayed because they should be batched. I'm not happy with the current system of piles on other shelves. There's no incentive to actually do the work. I think I'll make a folder for each batch, in the new system. However, when I put something in that folder, I won't move it forward. I'll let it continue its journey to the back, uninterrupted. When it eventually reaches the back, use the "daily weeding" momentum to do the batch, no matter how small.<br><br>Another option is to add a month (or year) to the file name. On July 1, new arrivals (or newly-touched) start going into the July file, and the June file starts its journey to the back. Or all papers printed in June go in the June file. (Whichever cut-off method works best for the type of batch.) Eventually, they'll stop arriving, and the file will reach the back. (What to do with a very late arrival? Probably put in the oldest file of that type of batch.)<br><br>Or put in a proxy for that type of batch. When that proxy reaches the back, search the system for things to do in the batch. Might be too easy to miss things.<br><br>(A proxy might work for files that aren't physically on the shelf, but I suspect that would break the momentum of "keep this physical pile under control".)<br><br>Files with slow research for future projects might be a problem. I have several stories and novels and complicated computer programs in the brain-storming stage. The active shelf cycle might be fast enough to keep me thinking about them, rather than letting them wither and die. I can move those to the existing alphabetical shelf. (Yes, that shelf is in need of weeding, another candidate for LAO.)<br><br>Early days yet, so we'll see what happens.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 July 2014 at 16:28 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>LAO stands for "little and often", right?
