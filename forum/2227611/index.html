That's easy to measure, and may well give you very useful information.<br><br>Alternatively you might draw up a list of everything you hope to do over a chosen length of time and give points to each project/task according to its difficulty, desirability and other relevant factors. After the period was over you could then evaluate the system according to how many points it had scored.<br><br>The trouble with this approach is that the evaluation system itself is going to impact on the system you are testing.<br><br>The best method is probably to keep an "Achievement Diary" while you are working a system, in which you record anything you do which you regard as noteworthy. It would be important to record negative things as well. This would give you a basis on which to make a more informed judgement.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 November 2013 at 12:18 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark - some very interesting comments/suggestions. <br><br>I really like where this conversation is going.

I'll quit using it. Alternately, if I'm getting a lot done, I'm more likely to like the system. Every week I ask myself if I'm getting more done? If not, I quit and move on. Just to encourage you, my testing has resulted in a system that I absolutely love. It includes a combination of two of Mark's approaches.

I would say that most of my offline friends use a datebook and some occasional lists and that's the end of it. <br><br>Seraphim, there's a lot to be said for idonethis. I really liked that it focused due attention to what was accomplished rather than always looking at what wasn't.<br><br>I have put up an explanation of the DIT / AF hybrid I have been using for several weeks that feels like it could actually be a keeper. Mark's recent statement about trying a 7-day "destroy backlog" task when the DIT list became 3 days overdue got me thinking. I decided to give myself just 3 days past due to complete everything before destroying overdue tasks-- with the caveat that I could use little and often for the tasks. Any little thing could permit me to redate the unfinished task for tomorrow.<br><br>I wanted to test it for several weeks because I was sure that using little and often would result in a gigantic list that I couldn't possibly take on. It hasn't. I'm not sure why, but this approach is the most motivating one I've found. It has enough of the gaming approach of AF that I am bound and determined not to let things become overdue, but allows me to work on current tasks without any extra rules. FYI, I have had to delete a couple of tasks, so I've used it beyond the immediate honeymoon phase. <br><br>Here's the post where I give more details. <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.psychowith6.com/can-project-management-help-get-done/">http://www.psychowith6.com/can-project-management-help-get-done/</a> (scroll down to the second half) Please let me know if you have any questions.

What benefits do you seen on rewriting the unfinished task at the end of the list. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I also developed a version of UTMS (Ultimate Time Management System) which I don't think I ever published. In it you re-enter unfinished tasks at the end of the Old List with a dot, which means that they have to have some action taken on them. Since no new stuff is ever added to the Old List, this does result in the filtered list of tasks which you are committed to finishing - as described by Wooba.<br><br>I think this worked better for me than any other version of UTMS. But it still came up against the problem of all AF4 based systems - that it takes a very long time before the New List becomes the Old List. That's why I prefer to use the dotting method with AF1.<br><br>The advantage of rewriting unfinished tasks at the end of the list is that it results in these tasks being finished faster. If you leave them in place with a dot they are only worked on once every pass through the list. If they are at the end of the list they have to be finished in the same pass before you can start the next pass.<br><br>For those who don't remember UTMS:<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/6/13/the-ultimate-time-management-system.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/6/13/the-ultimate-time-management-system.html</a><br><br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/7/2/the-ultimate-time-management-system-improved.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/7/2/the-ultimate-time-management-system-improved.html</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2013 at 20:21 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark - <br><br>A few years ago, you encouraged me to put "time wasting" tasks on my AF 1 list. I believe you suggested breaking down the individual sites (facebook, montreal canadians, etc) versus simply putting "surf web" on the list. However with these rules, the dot guarantees that I will waste time (as if I need a list to encourage this behaviour), given that "facebook' will always be a re-entered unfinished task, with a dot. Is this how you treat things like Facebook? <br><br>By the way, it's really nice to be engaging with you, AF and this forum again.

Facebook, web-surfing, that sort of task are open-ended and I wouldn't put a dot when I re-enter them. The exception would be if there were postings or comments which I had a real need to reply to.<br><br>&lt;&lt; Off to donate. &gt;&gt; Yeayyy!

I agree with your critique about UTMS. I partly solved the long time getting to the new list by making sure I check the new list every day and...<br><br>Do the new list following AF2 rules, that is starting from the newest and always going back to the newest when a task is completed. That means the most recent items get hit first in the new list, not last. <br><br>I would go back to AF1 in a heartbeat, but I found I have to use Outlook (work) and cannot find a way to make AF1 work in that environment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2013 at 20:36 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark: <br><br>&lt;&lt; With the dotting method it's important that you have defined when the task is finished. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Ah, I didn't realize the dot was optional when re-entering tasks. I'm currently editing my book, and usually use "edit book" as a task in my current (slowly becoming old) system. To use this rule, I'd need to change the longer term goal of "edit book" to "Edit section 3" or something like that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2013 at 20:41 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Since the AF days, I always associate a 'dot' with 'one task I am doing now' , it's always helped me to focus on the one selected task. I personally think I might struggle with lots of dotted items - especially if the tasks do not need to be done in order (or do they?) as in FV<br><br>So When it comes to re-entering an unfinished task, I may try placing a small horizonal line (or a vertical one) measuring just a centimetre or so to identify it as an unfinished task. Then I will place a dot more a less in the middle of the line so I can initiate focus on the selected task. I could then repeat this process until the task is done. <br><br>Obviously new and recurring tasks do not have a line drawn before them. <br><br>It probably sounds more complicated in theory than it actually is practice!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2013 at 21:55 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I personally think I might struggle with lots of dotted items - especially if the tasks do not need to be done in order (or do they?) as in FV &gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, the tasks do need to be done in order since the rule is that you can't scan past a dotted task without doing some work on it. I personally don't find it in the least confusing since "the one task I am doing now" is always the first dotted item.<br><br>However it's really up to you how you mark the tasks. That's not going to effect the way the system works.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 November 2013 at 22:10 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm locking this thread now as it's nearing the maximum size for one page.
