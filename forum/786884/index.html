With AF, I find the whole concept needs to be reworked. Why? Because the nature of AF includes daily mini reviews. <br><br>Are any of you doing AF &amp; weekly reviews. If so, how?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2009 at 22:45 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes Avrum<br><br>I now call it "Major Review".  Even with AF it is easy for lots of things to slip through the cracks and for me to lose a sense of priorities in my life.  Hence I just put "Major Review" as a task in AF and do it when it stands out.<br><br>One of the reasons why I went cold on GTD is that I could very rarely get around the the Weekly Review and I would usually skimp it through lack of time.  Now, I do it when I feel ready (maybe about once every ten days) and it is a great way of taking stock and renewing my sense that everything is in order.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2009 at 23:11 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jim, EXCELLENT idea. I struggle whenever I try to impose artificial deadlines on tasks like this.

I was agreeing with Jim that it was a good idea to put "Major Review" or "Weekly Review" as a task, and also pointing out that the AF instructions encourage people to use review items in that way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 7:45 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My reviews have not changed in years.  I do them weekly, monthly (coincident with the weekly), and yearly (coincident with the weekly but usually taking much longer.<br><br>Reviews to me mean aligning goals, projects and actions.  Personally, I don't think of AF as having anything to say about goals.  So every week I review where I stand with respect to my goals and assure that I have projects running to advance them, and actions on my AF list to move the projects forward.  (Sometimes I have the project listed on AF ... it all depends.)<br><br>As to resistance to reviews, I've never had a problem with that.  I suppose because I did not make it some horrendous thing as described in GtD.  I simply go over my goals for the period and assure myself that I'm advancing ... and take the appropriate steps to move forward during the next week.  It is all very casual.  Just me and my list and a pencil (or sometimes a computer file.)  I've read so many people complaining about the GtD review and wondered why they just don't give it up and review their goals instead.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 11:26 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>After following Kelly Forrister's global weekly review on Twitter at Thursday I cut down my weekly review checklist to the essentials:<br><br>- review my list of yearly and quarterly goals,<br>- review my list of current intentions and projects,<br>- review my list of current tasks and actions (Autofocus list),<br>- update my someday list.<br><br>Done.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 12:22 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello All,<br><br>As I come from and still embrace many of the principles of GTD, I always do a weekly review.  I do agree with David Allen that once a week it is important to sit back, reflect, review things, and make sure you are on course.  With my professional life, if I did not do this, I would sink in a sea of priorities of everyone that may not match entirely to my own.  <br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 17:52 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike,<br><br>I disagree -- I never have thought of the weekly review as "some horrendous thing" in GTD.  It is what you make it.  As far as I could tell, there were no GTD police enforcing things.  But with that said, I do agree that there are those out there that spend way too much time on reviewing versus doing!  Smiles...<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 18:09 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David - I think you're right that GTD itself doesn't make the weekly review a horrendous task, but people build up resistance precisely because of its being 'weekly'. Say your weekly review should be done on a Monday, but for whatever reason it can't be. Then suddenly it's a task you're feeling guilty about because you *should* have done it the day before. That makes it loom large and resistance sets in. That's why having it on the AF list is such a better approach for these 'quasi-regular' tasks</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2009 at 11:56 | Ed C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It seems to be more than just resistance to a task.  From what I read people say that their review takes them hours and hours.  I can't imagine what they are doing that it takes that long, but I can surely understand that they dread it if it does take that long.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2009 at 12:54 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It was project planning that made my weekly reviews take three to four hours. <br>But nowadays planning isn't a part of my weekly review anymore. Processing my inbox isn't anymore either. This tasks are now part of my AF list.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2009 at 13:21 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"But nowadays planning isn't a part of my weekly review anymore. Processing my inbox isn't anymore either"<br><br>Great point Rainer. And why I'm looking to rethink my weekly review a la Covey (Roles/Goals for the week) and not GTD.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2009 at 15:14 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>All good points.  I still schedule my weekly reviews and do everything possible to keep to this schedule.  I need this time to regroup and see where I am with things as I have so many inputs, things change in terms of priorities as the week progresses, and my preception of what I need to focus on at the time changes too.  A weekly review is my quiet time to review all that I have on my plate and decide what I need to do to move my many projects forward.  I can do this within a hour -- hour and a half at tops.  For me, it is invaluable time to keep my sanity.<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2009 at 18:16 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum, I do my review whenever I get below a certain number of pages - which usually means that new project(s) can be added onto my list.  It's seemed to work out to be about once a week that way.  That's probably due to the nature of my workflow on the list however, as I generally close out a lot of pages every Saturday/early Sunday and then add more goal-oriented stuff onto the list on Sunday evening.  <br><br>I don't see how AF contributes to a daily review though?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2009 at 23:23 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For me the weekly GTD review was repugnant because it involved going through every someday/maybe task, too. I don't add every hair-brained idea that pops into my head to my AF list--only those that I want to do soon. I did, however, add these kinds of things to my GTD list. I don't even need a reminder with AF. I just find I like going through the whole list periodically to determine what things are now time-sensitive or need to be culled.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 June 2009 at 4:33 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am going to change my weekly review to what Mark and others have suggested here -- entering it as a task on my AF list.  It may occur more than once a week or less -- I will let my sense of things at the time decide when I come upon that task in my lists.  <br><br>The good thing about this is that there will be one less meeting on my calendar every week.  That HAS to be a good thing!

Are my choice of words not translating well or was it the concept? What I meant was that with GTD I literally wrote every possible idea or task down. I understood that to be necessary for a "mind like water." With AF, I now have an idea for a TV show. I have no intention of doing anything with it. Whereas I would have added it to my GTD someday/maybe list, I do NOT add it to my AF list. If at some point I think, " should really work on that TV idea," I would add it to the list. I hope that's clear. I wasn't very sharp yesterday  (wasn't feeling well) but I am still not seeing the problem with what I wrote. lol</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 June 2009 at 17:21 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Mel:  You only write down the hare-brained ideas that you want to do soon?  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 June 2009 at 0:43 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>LOL Seraphim.
