I have gotten some real gems from your books and systems.<br><br>I really want to make this system work for me.  I am worried about your line concerning Review Mode, "...not doing it properly will affect the workings of the whole system." I liked the fact that you included a sample page, and I see that you will probably do another video in the near future.  Since I learn best by example, would it also be possible to hear/read about your review process in particular?  Maybe you could write up some examples like, "Entered review mode, saw task X, thought about it for several minutes and decided I am resisting it because..., then, decided to delete, or...decided to break it down, or...decided to re-enter" whatever.  If you could give lots of examples, that would help direct my Review Mode.<br><br>Eternally grateful for your insight and wit,<br>Janis</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 19:13 | Janis</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Janis - I'll give this a shot. <br><br>Yesterday, I had the following tasks on "notice for review":<br><br>* read "x" book<br>* contact "x" client<br>* remix song<br>* laundry<br>and about 5-6 more items as well. <br><br>As the day (yesterday) progressed, I made some movement on some of the tasks, but still, by this AM, the following tasks remained unactioned, and hence, placed on review:<br><br>* read "x"<br>* remix song<br><br>And though frustrated that I didn't take action on these items, and even experienced a tinge of motivation to work on them, I followed the rules and put 'em up for review. <br><br>At some point (today, tomorrow, next week), I'm going to come across "review tasks" on my autofocus list. If the mood strikes (read: guilt, fear, etc), I'll look at my "tasks for review". For this example, let's assume that:<br><br>* read "x"<br>* remix song<br><br>are the only two tasks being reviewed. I look at the first task "read x" and ask: Do I want to read x. I don't. Not now anyway, so it remains as a review item. However I do need to remix that song. And yet, I ignored this task for over two weeks. So I ask myself: What would I need to do to make "remix song" more attractive to do? And then the brainstorming begins. Once that's complete, I reenter the task onto my list (reworded to increase motivation). For example, I may renter the task as:<br><br>*open track, and listen for new ideas<br><br>And that's it. Hope that's helpful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 19:52 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My review is very similar to Avrum, the only difference being that if I have decided not to "Read X" now, but still think I might someday, I will cross it off of AF and add it to my Someday/Maybe mindmap.  I also include a task in AF of "Check Someday/Maybe mind map" to look for items that I might want to add to my AF list.  I just prefer to clear out  highligted items that I am not going to be doing in the foreseeable future off my AF list and store them in a mind/map that I am not looking at on a daily basis.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 20:29 | Alan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Janis,<br><br>You said: &lt;&lt;I am worried about your line concerning Review Mode, "...not doing it properly will affect the workings of the whole system." &gt;&gt;<br><br>I believe Mr. Forster was speaking *primarily* of not giving into the temptation to take items that are either "on notice for review" (i.e. above the line)  or "up for review" (i.e. highlighted) and simply renter them at the end of the list if you haven't done anything with that item.<br><br>If you do this, then you eviscerate the review process which seems to be  the "engine" that drives Autofocus. <br><br>As to how you handle the specifics of the review process (what questions you ask yourself, etc.) that might vary more among individuals.<br><br>Thoughts?<br>--Joseph<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 21:06 | Joseph</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>Someday/Maybe *mindmap*? Do tell! What is that? What advantages does it have over a regular list? What does it look like?<br><br>Very interested!!<br>--Joseph</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 21:08 | Joseph</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, all!! VERY helpful what you folks posted, especially to Avram who took the time to write out that paragraph about the specific questions you ask yourself when reviewing those tasks you are resisting.  I know that it is a personal process and highly dependent on the task, but if anyone else can give their specific examples of questioning, I could add these to my toolbox of self-interviewing tools.  <br><br>And yes, Alan, I would also love to hear about the mindmap.  Right now I use a physical folder for Someday/Maybe in the GTD style because sometimes it is a brochure or map that I want to use to trigger the idea and one line on a list just won't do it.  What I was missing, though, was a line on RAF that says, "Review Someday/Maybe".  Thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 21:35 | Janis</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You can find quite a bit about mind-mapping on the web.  It can be done on paper and there are also a large number of computer programs to facilitate the process. Basically, you start with a circle in which you write the main idea you are mapping and then draw branches out from there with ever smaller and more precise concepts on the branches as you get further from the circle.  In this instance, my middle circle says Someday/Maybe and the lines drawn from there are Family, Fitness, Finances, Friends/Fun,  and Stuff. Then from each of those are lines drawn out with ideas of things I would like to do or accomplish in each category. From there additional lines might have the next action required to make it happen. <br>It just helps me to keep my someday/maybe list more organized and useful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 August 2009 at 22:38 | Alan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If you have the time or the inclination, it is well worth reading one of the many books the Buzans have written on mind-mapping. As with AF, they have some simple but specific and important rules (that go beyond the bones Alan mentions). The brothers Buzan don't agree on the importance of these though :). For example, we are advised to use colour, images, lists, curving lines not sraight, a limited number of branches etc. I can't explain here why these are important, but they are. They have sections written on what is NOT a mindmap too, to make sure you're really harnessing it properly. My favourite book on it is 'The Mind Map Book'. Very comprehensive. I have been referring to it for years and do not attempt an essay without going back to it. One mindmap I did for an essay, I really liked the look of so I stuck it on my kitchen wall. I was later invited to submit that essay in a competition, which I won. I find mind-mapping as powerful  to me as the shield Haephestus made was to Achilles :P.
