First of all, I apologize for being obtuse on this. Please don't think I'm being argumentative; I'm just trying to clear up my own confusion.<br><br>So let's walk through a scenario. Page 1 is full. 30 items in C1, 28 of which are marked through and two are highlighted. C2 has 15 items in it, all of which are marked through. Page 2 is full. 30 items in C1, none of which are marked through and none of which are highlighted. C2 has three items in it, none of which are marked through. Page 3 has five things in C1, none of which are marked through or highlighted. C2 is empty.<br><br>I start my day. I need to work on something. I have nothing on page 1 to look at, so I'm on page 2. Page 2 is my current page. I work on the three things in C2 (because my intuition led me to) and finish them completely. They get a mark through them. I intuitively start a task on C1 but don't finish it. I mark through it and rewrite it in C2 of page three. Everything's pretty straight-forward up to this point.<br><br>So I'm still on page 2 with nothing to worry about in C2. I look at C1 and nothing stands out. I look at page three and something stands out, so I start working on the task on page three. Now, because I did something on page three without doing something on page 2, doesn't that mean that I should dismiss the tasks on page 2? Quote: If no tasks are done in Column 1 during a visit to a page, all remaining tasks in Column 1 are dismissed.<br><br>So now page one has 28 "actioned" C1 tasks, 2 "dismissed" C1 tasks, and 15 "actioned" C2 tasks. Page two now has 1 "actioned" C1 tasks, 29 "dismissed" C1 tasks, and 3 "actioned" C2 tasks. Page three has 1 "actioned" C1 task, 4 "available" C1 tasks, and 1 "available" C2 task.<br><br>Since page two has no "available" tasks-- everything is either "actioned" or "dismissed", that makes page three my current page, correct? And page three is my current page, correct? Since page three is also the last page, if I don't complete a task, it goes into C2 on page... page one?<br><br>--------<br>If I move to the "next" page, then everything on the "previous" page should either have a line through it or be highlighted. (Rule #1 under "Dismissal".) If everything on a page is either marked through or highlighted, then the page is no longer active. (First sentence of the paragraph immediately preceding the "Dismissal" rules.)<br><br>If I take both of those rules into account, I do not see how I can have an active page previous to the page that I'm working. I'm repeatedly hearing from multiple people that this is not the case, so I'm definitely missing something somewhere.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2011 at 21:32 | jFenter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt; .

Time to move on.  But first, "If no tasks are done in Column 1 during a visit to a page, all remaining tasks in Column 1 are dismissed."  Did you do anything in C1? Yes: one thing was started.  Therefore you don't dismiss the page.  <br><br>&lt;&lt;I look at page three and something stands out, so I start working on the task on page three.  Now, because I did something on page three without doing something on page 2, doesn't that mean that I should dismiss the tasks on page 2?&gt;&gt;<br><br>This seems odd.  Doing something on page 3 has nothing to do with page 2.  Deal with page 2 on its own; and whether you do something or not on page 3 is only relevant to page 3.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 March 2011 at 22:35 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm starting to understand my confusion, I think. I'm a single-minded person. I look at my list and I find one and only one task to work on at a time. Look at list: work on one task. I've been considering this as a visit to the list. When I finish working on that one task, I make another visit to the list. Look at list: work on one task. That's another-- a different-- visit to the list. I may visit my list twenty times in a day, but I've been considering them all as individual, unique visits. That's why, Matt, that if I do something on page three, I feel like I skipped page two.<br><br>My interpretation of the rules tells me that on any visit to the list, if I don't work on the first page, then I should dismiss that first page. Since, for me, each time I look at the list is considered a different visit (again, in my mind), then I find that I must do work on the first page or it will get dismissed. This is why I haven't understood why others can have "previous" pages. I do understand now, though.<br><br>There are two instances where you can have previous pages. First, if you look at the list and pick out more than one item, then as long as one of your items is on the first page then the rest can be on any page at all. Second, if you can look at the list multiple times in a single "visit", then you can look at the whole list and not apply the dismissal rules until the end of your "visit". (So, I can work my entire list throughout the day and only apply the dismissal rules at the end of the day. If, by the end of the day, I haven't worked anything on the first page, only then do I dismiss them.)<br><br>I now have three approaches to choose from. I can choose to continue dealing with my list the way I have been... only with a clearer understanding of what's going on. Or I could pick multiple things from the list at a time. Or I could apply the dismissal rules at larger intervals, possibly on a daily or twice-daily basis.<br><br>Thank you for helping me understand better; I certainly feel like I've learned a bit. ;) And I appreciate your patience with me!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2011 at 15:37 | jFenter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It can be difficult to keep track of whether you have actually done a C1 task on a given page. I like Seraphim's little trick. He notes the date in the margin whenever he visits a page and ticks it when he first does a C1 task.<br><br>Incidentally, the situation you note can come up in two circumstances: when you have properly dismissed all previous pages (for instance, when you are suffering a task explosion and need to move quickly through the list) and on your first setting up the list. In both cases, I thinkk you put the C2s on the same page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2011 at 15:52 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I haven't actually hit the situation yet where I've met the problem of only having the one page on which to write in Col 2. But my general reasoning is as follows.<br><br>There are only two circumstances in which I am writing an entry in some page or other's Col 2:<br>1) It's urgent. In which case I want to get to it quite soon, so onto the current/active page it goes.<br>2)It's not urgent and it's an unfinished task. If I'm writing it now, then I've just done something on it, so I'm not going to be doing some more for a little while, so I don't want it on the current/active page where it may distract me.  (I don't know if this corresponds to Mark's reasoning).  Now this unfinished task is a bit of a problem if I only have the one page available. I can either put it on this same page (which I think is Mark's position on this) or I might (be a rebel and) put it on a new otherwise blank page (which will become my next active page after I finish with the current one for now).<br><br>This 'rebellious choice' means that I have a page with one or more Col 2 tasks on it but no col 1 tasks. I can't immediately find anything in the rules that explicitly proscribe this, but again I don't know what Mark intended, merely what he wrote, and I get the feeling that it conflicts with what some other contributors think.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2011 at 20:12 | John Angus (Anguish)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@ jFenter<br><br>&gt; I now have three approaches to choose from.

If in between those two moments you did anything in the first column, nothing gets dismissed.<br><br>In my experience dismissing a page is quite rare; usually only after most of the page is finished, after having gone around the entire list several times.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2011 at 21:19 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>(Revise is broken) Of course if you're happy with what you're doing, by all means carry on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 March 2011 at 21:22 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;So I'm still on page 2 with nothing to worry about in C2.

I use a post-it note labelled 'current page' to keep me focussed where I am, and as I turn the page after actioning that C1 item and finding nothing else drawing my attention to it, I bring the post-it note with me so I know where I'm looking for a C1 item from before I leave that page.

Mark recommends we follow the original rules as strictly as possible for awhile to learn the dynamics, and only then make adjustments as needed to fit our situation or style.   If we make adjustments too early, it tends to make the system haphazard and we won't really get a good feel for its dynamics.   It's up to you to decide if it's "too early" or not.   :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 March 2011 at 16:06 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>jFenter needs to realize that the idea is not to "visit the list" but rather "visit the page." Put a paperclip or post-it note or flag or something on it, to remember which is the current page. When you come back to the list, continue working from the same current page. When you have taken some action on at least one task in Column 1, and have everything crossed off in Column 2, you may choose to go on to the next page. This is the "visit" we are talking about. When you turn to the next page (and mark it as the new current page), if you don't find anything you want to do in Column 1, the page must be dismissed. <br><br>The rare circumstance where there is only one active (non-dismissed) page is the same situation as when starting a new notebook, writing a new list.  I don't think there is any point to using Column 2 on a 1-page list for unfinished tasks. Just rewrite it at the end of the list (in Column 1). It's not urgent, so it doesn't belong in Column 2 of this current page. And there is no "Next page" yet, until the current Column 1 is filled.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 March 2011 at 18:59 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>OMG.
