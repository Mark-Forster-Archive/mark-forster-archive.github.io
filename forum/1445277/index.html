Many of these ideas are gleaned from Mark and other contributors to this forum. For brevity and due to my own laziness, I haven't included specific attributions or links to earlier posts.  Hope this helps others; just writing it all down helped me. ;-)<br><br>Comments, criticisms, additional Q&amp;As are all welcome!<br><br>-----------------------------<br>1. How can I remember where I am, and whether I've done any C1 tasks?  Mark and seek a 'lonely' dot: place a dot to the left of the next chosen task, as usual.  When completed, don't join the cross-out line or connect the dots vertically, until you're ready to move onto the next page.<br><br>2. If I'm taking a break, how do I mark the next task?  Use a pencil to make the dot.  When you come back, you can erase the dot if a different task calls out to you.<br><br>3. How can I jump to a task on another page, without breaking the rules?  Add a duplicate entry to C2 on the current page, as an "urgent" task.  Cross out the original.<br>	<br>4. How can I motivate myself to clear the page completely?  Push to do just a little something on each remaining task.  Visualize the cleared page.<br><br>5. How can I consolidate many pages with only a few tasks remaining?  As in the previous suggestion, push yourself to do a little on each &amp;&nbsp;feel good about clearing the page.  Or just laugh off any one of these pages – RDRR: Relax, Dismiss, Review, Reenter (RDRR = haR Dee haR haR!).<br><br>6. How do I separate two contexts (e.g. Home and Work)?  Use the stalactite-stalagmite method (a.k.a. cave deposits).  Write work-related tasks from the top down in each column.  Write home-related tasks from the bottom up.  Draw a heavy or colored horizontal line to separate when the column is full.<br><br>7. How can I avoid dismissing a page with many tasks remaining?  Choose the least painful task and do a little something on it.  Or add a question mark (?) to a task's description, making deciding not to do it a valid way to complete it.  Also note that skipping a page with only out-of-context tasks in C1 is allowed; in this case, you don't need to dismiss (yet).<br><br>8. How can I avoid getting stuck on one page?  Use C2 wisely (only for truly urgent tasks and those you are truly committed to finishing).  Also, you can set a timer for each remaining task, or for turning the page.<br><br>9. What is the best way to deal with a big task?  The answer depends on what will work for you, and which of two methods will cause less anxiety.  If it's important and you want to focus on finishing it, you can use C2 reentry, always listing the task in the same way.  If it's less important to finish soon, but you still don't want to end up dismissing it, break it into many small Next Actions (NAs), and put each next action into C1, instead of listing it as one big task.  The choice of how to do this important, but both strategies can work.<br><br>10. What other tools should I have to make my SF notebook fully functional?  Use a multicolor pen/pencil, a 43-folders "tickler" file, A-Z reference files, In and Pending trays for organizing current paperwork, and a calendar for appointments only.<br><br>11. How can I postpone task entry?  Put the task description by itself on a card or sheet of paper and place it in your tickler file, in the folder for the day (or month) when you want it to be entered into your SF system.  For big multitask projects, make separate project lists of Next Actions, and enter only a single NA for each project into SF.<br><br>12. How can I "link" my paper-based list to emails, files, etc.?  Keep a date-based email archive (monthly, quarterly, whatever), and write the email date and/or file location in [square brackets] as part of the task description.  You can also just print out the email or other computer document and put it in your Pending tray and/or tickler file.<br><br>13. How can I make using SF more fun?  Add easy tasks.  Also enter fun/break/exercise activities as tasks.  Don't forget to browse and/or post to this website.<br><br>14. How can I stay in the flow?  Use a pocket notebook so you can always carry your list for reference and emptying your head.  Pencil-in the next dot when on break and you're not sure which will be your next task when you get back.   Remember the little-and-often principle.  Don't be afraid to dismiss a page –&nbsp;you can always reenter tasks after reviewing them.  Minimize the use of C2.<br><br>15. How can I track my progress?  At the beginning of each day, write the date to the right of the first new entry.  Leave 'lonely' dots on the current page until you are ready to turn to the next one.  Occasionally make side counts of number of active pages, number of remaining tasks, etc.<br>-----------------------------</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2011 at 22:30 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ubi - Great list!

E.g., if you have 12 pages and want to cycle through them all in 8 hours, set a timer for 45 minutes every time you start a new page.  <br><br>- Enter urgent items in C2 on the NEXT page, not C2 on the current page<br><br>- Use a notebook with more lines per page</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2011 at 22:58 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Woah, dude!

I did not follow closely the discussions of SF when it was released, because I was not doing it. Now, I am trying to catch up on what I missed, so I appreciate your post.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2011 at 21:10 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Ubi.<br><br>"RDRR": best advice I've seen for ages.

This way when you see the flag on the current page you know you haven't done any C1 tasks yet.<br><br>See here: <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/426952/column1-flag.jpg">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/426952/column1-flag.jpg</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 March 2011 at 12:12 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been finding that post-its lose their stickiness after moving forwards several times.<br><br>So I added a couple of marker ribbons to my Moleskine. Now I have:<br><br>The original ribbon: marks the open page for new tasks<br>New ribbon 1: marks the current page<br>New ribbon 2 (short, doesn't stick out):marks the current page if no C1s have been worked, otherwise the next page with open C1s.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 March 2011 at 14:06 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Glad people are enjoying this.  Sometimes you need to laugh.<br><br>Regarding #1 &amp; keeping your place, I have tried post-it notes &amp; flags, paper clips, etc.  But I have found that using nothing but the dot(s), along with Mark's X/circle/hilite for completed pages, works best for me. Having to move flags around just slows me down.  Thanks again to Kiwi Erik for this idea –&nbsp;see second comment at <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1428945">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1428945</a> for more details.<br><br>Previously, I had often turned to a new page without moving the flag, and still lost my place. I also put my notebook away for extended periods, and found it hard to remember which page I was really on, and what I had done since getting to that current page. Leaving a 'lonely' hanging dot on one page, or many if you've done several things, helps also to recall just how much you've done before leaving the page.  <br><br>Of course, this method will only work if you are rigorous about connecting all the dots to the horizontal crossouts and making the vertical connecting lines, before you start on a new page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2011 at 0:39 | ubi</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
