The reason for this was that I didn't feel I was getting the most important things done using pure AF, although I WAS being more productive.  I tried separating my list by the different areas of my life.  I started with 4 lists, then went to 3 and then 2 lists.  This helped with organizing my tasks, but I didn't know when to work on which list!  Then I read DIT and tried to do a hybrid of the two systems.  This worked okay on high energy days, but the past week has been just horrible for me in terms of energy and I haven't gotten very much done! <br><br>So, as it's now close to 4 pm on my most difficult day in awhile (I feel tired, have a bit of a headache, and somewhat depressed and demoralized), I had a "lightbulb moment."  I need to go back to PURE AF!  When I used "pure AF," I was more productive than I had been in years.  Sure, I was getting more of the little things done, but I realize now that many of those so-called little things have been around as "someday, maybe" items for a long time.  I think I was clearing those things out so I would have more energy and space for the bigger items.  My control freak nature didn't want to just let the process of AF work for me.  In the course of the past month or 6 weeks since I've been playing around with the system, some of the things I felt were important have dropped off because they really weren't that important.  I think it was Christine B who said that AF allowed her to look at why certain things weren't getting done and let her dismiss things which really needed to be dismissed.  The same thing has happened for me EVEN while I was resisting doing AF in its simple and pure form.<br><br>I have decided to go back to one list and to do AF all the time except when I truly have a pressing deadline.  Then I will use the common sense rule and do what needs to be done.  What I'm going to try is to put a letter in front of the task to note the context for the item (W for work, E for education, T for Toastmasters, and H for home/other).  I thought of using the left side of the page for work/education and the right side for other tasks, but I think that I will just let everything go on the same pages.  The letter will help me to track what I'm entering and what's getting done.  I use just every other line so I can read the tasks better and a squiggly line through the task when it has been completed.  I also write the date completed next to the task and separate the entry of tasks by date (put a date at the left and then enter all tasks I write that day below the line).  These are simple additions to help me and I don't think they take away from AF as it was created so beautifully by Mark.<br><br>I can be a glutton for punishment sometimes!  I at first raved about AF and then I resisted that which was helping me SO much.  I keep trying to overthink things and trying to be someone I'm not.   I have a lot on my plate and my priorities are ever changing, but my intuitive mind has a lot of wisdom.  I fail to trust it much of the time, but it IS wise.  I have always been unconventional and rebellious and AF fits my personality type so wonderfully.  If I had been doing AF today, I would probably have gotten 5 times as much done, but I was trying to fit a square peg into a round hole by trying to do high concentration activities on a day when I just didn't have it in me to do such things.  Even coffee couldn't push me over the edge.  I'm sure you've all had such days.<br><br>Well, I am rambling now, but I just wanted to thank Mark and all of you for your help since January 5th when I started AF.  I haven't posted much, but have read many of the posts on this forum and have been helped tremendously by your insights.  I will post later this week and let you know how I'm doing back on pure AF.  I think I will have good things to report!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 April 2009 at 23:54 | debbier</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Debbier,<br><br>Two thoughts from my experience with AF:<br><br>1) I tried all kinds of tagging of tasks and dropped them all, in the end.  What I found is that it made my scan of the page more complicated.  As I watched my internal process I saw that I was having to "decode" each line before I fully "understood" it and could then make a decision.  It might seem silly but it really did drain me.  Somehow it is mentally easier to just "know" what a thing is about than to look at a tag and internally "decode" it.  I dunno, wacko I know ;-)  I also did the date thing and dropped that as it added more clutter to the line that gave me no real payback.  The only major thing I do that is somewhat outside of the rules is to make a "hot list" on a Post-It stuck to the font of my book.  I put items on that from my scan of the entire list in the morning ... things that I think should really get done today and I concentrate on those.  They get crossed off the Post-It when done and crossed off the main AF list when I next encounter them there ... usually the next morning.<br><br>2) I wrote here about Thomas Leonard and his book "The Portable Coach" wherein he discusses the concept of "tolerations".  His idea is that incompletions drain energy and completions energize one.  Things that you are tolerating in life represent incompletions and should be dealt with to avoid the energy drain every time they bug you.  Likewise things left hanging around on lists not getting done really need to be done or dismissed so that they are not incompletions.  It could be the reason that you have found more energy by going back to AF and knocking things off.<br><br>Just a couple of thoughts.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2009 at 8:39 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Dibbier<br><br>I do agree with Mark regarding the tagging - I tried a number of things but found that the simpler the better.  In fact if you ever want to scan for just your Home/Work/Toastmaster items you will more than likely find that your mind is perfectly capable of recognising them in isolation without any form tagging.  If you really do want to mark specific tasks in any way, a suffix as opposed to a prefix, is less distracting.<br><br>I know the times I got overtaken by the panic of "stuff" and tried to adapt AF in any way, or to get too much into "do it now" mode, then that old sense of panic came back - returning to Pure AF was always such a relief and it is rare for me to work outside it now.<br><br>Best of luck!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2009 at 12:51 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>oops sorry Debbie - I previewed the post and didn't spot the spelling error on your name!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2009 at 12:51 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
