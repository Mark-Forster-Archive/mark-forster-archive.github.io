I felt my head get thrown back and there was no headrest in the back seat of the cab. My driver asked me if I was OK and I told him I was. <br><br>About 10 days later my neck started to hurt. At first I didn't pay it any mind. Then it got worse. I discovered that I had a lot of pain when I was sitting, second only to the pain when driving a car. <br><br>After a couple of months of pain, I finally used some logic this week and found some bricks in the rubble outside my office. I put them under my desk so I could stand at my desk all day. Today, I refined my furniture strategy and bought some concrete blocks ("cinder blocks") which will raise my desk 15.5 inches (39.4 cm). <br><br>I am now thinking I wish I hurt my neck years ago. Although the bottoms of my feet hurt a little, I think I will adapt quickly. In the meantime, it really is better to work standing up. (I only sit down for lunch at my desk.) <br><br>My web research suggests that stand-up desks are more common in Japan and Europe than in the US (I live in New York).

Back problems forced me to look for solutions. The standing desk has become the most important part of my work support system. I have a standing desk in my two offices and at my home office.  I believe I think clearer when I am at my standing desk.  People do tend to freak out about the standing desk so  I have a normal height desk for meetings or when I need to sit.  I tried having a stool/chair for the standing desk but that aggravated my lower back.  It does take some time to develop the "strength" to stand for long periods so I find I will build up to longer and longer periods of standing.  I now can stand for 3-4 hours easily.  If using a computer it is best to get the monitor raised to eye level as well.  There are pictures of the famous film editor Walter Murch's standing desk he uses to edit films.  There is a long history of distinguished people who worked at standing desks and there are some amazing bespoke furniture makers who build exquisite standing desks.  I have always built my own but one day I will buy my fantasy desk that costs about 10k. About 1 in 10 of the people who see my standing desk go out and build or buy their own and thank me for changing their lives.  I have my desk height at 42.75 inches which is the measurement from my elbow when my arm is relaxed in the typing position.  Having said all of this about the benefits of the standing desk I have learned that posture is probably the most important factor in doing any kind of desk work. Or countertop, or workbench.  No desk or chair can keep you from adopting bad posture habits that will always lead to spinal problems.  Even I have found myself "slouching" at my standing desk.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 April 2009 at 18:27 | Stark</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm very interested in standing desks.  I have a mind to build one myself, but I have some questions for those who already use one:<br><br>1) How do you handle computer usage?  It seems that the height that I'd want my monitors at would be too high up to use a keyboard comfortably.  Also, it seems like there's not right height at which to use a mouse. <br><br>2) Has anyone tried a standing desk with a treadmill underneath?  This I also wonder how it works with walking and typing at the same time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 April 2009 at 20:45 | Wellington Grey</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Wellington,<br><br>1) As Stark pointed out, you want to make the height of the desk equal to the height of your elbows when your forearms are parallel to the floor. If you do this, the keyboard and mouse will be in comfortable positions. Likewise, the top of my monitor is about 4 inches below my eye level, which is also good. From the link that I posted above, you don't want the top of the monitor to go above eye level. <br><br>2) I have only been at this for 4 days, but I do not have any plans to get a treadmill. I have, however, found that I do shift around quite a bit. <br><br>@Stark,<br><br>Thanks for the very informative post. I admire anyone who has the skills to build their own. I was quite lucky to find that standard concrete blocks (discretely covered in black fabric) put my desk at exactly 44 inches, which is right level with my elbows.<br><br>So far, I've managed to avoid any sitting this week, except for when I eat lunch. The eating takes about 20 minutes. So I am standing from 7:25 am to 5:15 pm. <br><br>I have seen a number of electrically powered adjustable height desks, but most of them were less than 10K (were you referring to US dollars)?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 April 2009 at 21:40 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Is it good or bad to be "on the frontiers of fitness?"<br><br>See <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/magazine/18exercise-t.html?th=&amp;emc=th&amp;pagewanted=all">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/magazine/18exercise-t.html?th=&amp;emc=th&amp;pagewanted=all</a><br><br>&lt;&lt;Streaming through much of the science and advice about exercise and weight loss is a certain Puritan streak, a sense that exercise, to be effective in keeping you slim, must be of almost medicinal dosage — an hour a day, every day; plenty of brisk walking; frequent long runs on the treadmill. But the very latest science about exercise and weight loss has a gentler tone and a more achievable goal. “Emerging evidence suggests that ­unlike bouts of moderate-vigorous activity, low-intensity ambulation, standing, etc., may contribute to daily energy expenditure without triggering the caloric compensation effect,” Braun wrote in the American College of Sports Medicine newsletter.<br><br>In a completed but unpublished study conducted in his energy-metabolism lab, Braun and his colleagues had a group of volunteers spend an entire day sitting. If they needed to visit the bathroom or any other location, they spun over in a wheelchair. Meanwhile, in a second session, the same volunteers stood all day, “not doing anything in particular,” Braun says, “just standing.” The difference in energy expenditure was remarkable, representing “hundreds of calories,” Braun says, but with no increase among the upright in their blood levels of ghrelin or other appetite hormones. Standing, for both men and women, burned multiple calories but did not ignite hunger. One thing is going to become clear in the coming years, Braun says: if you want to lose weight, you don’t necessarily have to go for a long run. “Just get rid of your chair.”<br><br>Gretchen Reynolds writes the Phys Ed column for the magazine.

I've been standing for years, six or seven I think. First time I've seen this thread, though. I have a conventional desk on stilts, next to a tall one that I built myself, for a combined surface almost ten feet wide.<br><br>My desktops are at 42", which is my elbow height, and I've noticed this height seems to be the standard for bars and service windows. I had tried 36", because it is the standard for kitchen counters and worktables at places like FedEx or the post office, but it did not work well for writing and keyboarding. I was surprised, but desk work turned out to be very different on the wrists than cooking or document assembly. Try writing for more than a few minutes at 36", and your wrists will feel it!<br><br>The one type of work that I prefer to do seated, and which does not work well at all for me while standing, is (aptly named!) "sit and think" work. To read a book or a long document, to brainstorm, to watch a video longer than a few minutes, even to build a new chain in Mark's FV notebook system, I prefer to sit on the couch or a soft chair. I typically take a little break, get a drink, and take my notebook to the couch.<br><br>So I stand probably 75% of the time to "get stuff done" and sit down someplace comfy to go "hmmm."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 July 2012 at 16:32 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have had a standing desk for a few years now. I put it at 45", which is an inch or so above elbow height. This supports the elbows for typing with the back straight. Any lower, and I tended to bend forward and got a sore back. Ideally the desk would be adjustable, to allow finding the correct height by experiment.<br>I alternate between standing and sitting at the same desk. This required a 34" stool (higher than most bar stools) to allow the same elbow height when seated as when standing.<br>Other advantages: the increased mobility is great for tasks such as sorting papers.  There is plenty of space under the desk for the printer and the PC so they effectively disappear from the home office. And it seems to encourage alertness as it is more difficult to doze off when you are standing up!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 August 2012 at 9:37 | tarentola</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The August 21, 2012 Wall Street Journal had an article by Ralph Gardner Jr. about standup desks.

My lower back and my shoulders always felt tight at the end of the day and I usually felt fatigued on my way home from the office even though I eat fairly well and exercise regularly. <br><br>On the first day, I definitely felt that my body was protesting from standing for several hours. My legs felt numb and my lower back felt tired. But I persisted, and with using the standing desk came the natural inclination to avoid slouching. I kept reminding myself to march in place, do side bends and stretches and sometimes even squats.<br><br>Since I was already standing I found that I walked around the office more, taking more frequent, short breaks. Soon, I was okay skipping my monthly lower back massages.<br><br>https://yo-yodesk.com/collections/yoyo-classic</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 February 2019 at 11:22 | Paul E.

I was surprised by the observations from some writers about the types of work best done sitting vs. standing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2019 at 17:58 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My feeling is that if you have a good mixed to-do list which deals with all aspects of your life, you will naturally get up and down and move about during the day. So one moment I'm writing this comment sitting at my desk, the next I will be checking the oil level in my car. It's one good reason for keeping everything on the same list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2019 at 19:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My solution was to saw down the legs on a £4.99 table from Ikea, and place it on top of my regular desk.  It's a good size to hold monitor on stand, keyboard and notebook etc.  Very simple to place it on the desk for a couple of hours at a time, which really helps to keep my energy alert.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2019 at 10:18 | Colin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My solution is a large rubber tub placed on a table and a whiteboard on that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 February 2019 at 19:28 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
