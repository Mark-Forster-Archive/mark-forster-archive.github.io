Is this any better than my first guess?<br><br>1. Use a daily diary book.<br><br>2. Start the day by reading through your list for the day, and then drawing a line at the end.  You then process the list in AF1 fashion -- go back to the top and carefully go down through each item. Do whatever stands out. Work on it as long as you want. Keep cycling through the page till nothing stands out.<br><br>3. After you have taken action on a task, if there is still work left to be done on that task, then you need to decide:  Do I want to keep working on this later today?  If yes, cross the item off, and add it again below the line.  If no, then you need to decide when you want to take further action -- the default would be "tomorrow".  Add the task to the Task Diary on the appropriate date.<br><br>4. After you have cycled through the list and nothing else feels ready to be done, you now move to the items below the line.  I'm guessing that this works like AF4:  the line marks the end of the Closed List and the beginning of the Open List.  Go through the Open List once, from top to bottom, taking action on anything that feels ready to be done.  Use rule #3 to deal with tasks that you work on, but do not complete.<br><br>5.  When nothing else is ready to be done on the Open List, move back to the Closed List.<br><br>6.  As new work arrives during the day:  If it MUST be done today, then add it to today's Open List (below the line).  If it cannot be done till some future date, then add it to the Task Diary for that date.  Otherwise, add it to your list for tomorrow.  (I had this rule in my last guess, and Mark said it was only 50% right.  But I'm not sure what to change, so I will leave it as-is and see what happens...)<br><br>7.  At the end of the day, take 2 minutes for your "daily review".  Look at each item that still remains on your Closed List.  Think hard about why it didn't get done.  Maybe it never really needed to be done in the first place?  Maybe you are resisting it for some reason; perhaps a rewrite is in order?  Maybe it's just not time yet?  After thinking about it, decide whether to add it back on your list, either tomorrow or on some future date, either rewritten or not.  Likewise, look at each item that remains on your Open List.  These are all supposed to be items that were either urgent and MUST be done today; or they were items that you had worked on at least a little, and then you wanted to keep working on them again later that day.  In both cases, you made a commitment to yourself to take action, but you DIDN'T take action.  So again, think about why, and then decide what to do with each item:  delete, add as-is to later date, add with changes to later date.<br><br><br>Even if this is totally wrong, it's a good exercise for me.  The DIT book is really speaking to me -- on many levels.  The "interests" vs "commitments" part really struck a chord today -- in fact all the material in Chapter 2 about defining limits.  AF4 helps me manage all my different interests, but actually helps perpetuate the myth that it's possible to be effective while pursuing all of them.  Thinking about how the rigor of DIT can be enhanced by the intuitiveness of AF has helped me see some of the issues I am dealing with more clearly.<br><br><br>So, thanks again Mark for all your work -- it has made such a difference.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2010 at 9:50 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim:<br><br>Bear in mind that I have made a lot of changes since your first attempt :<br><br>1) Spot on.<br><br>2) 50% correct.<br><br>3) Spot on.<br><br>4) Wrong.<br><br>5) Wrong<br><br>6) Now spot on!<br><br>7) Wrong</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2010 at 10:34 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My try:<br><br>7.)  My guess is that at the end of the day the page (of the day) is just an AF1 like page.  Even if you didn't touch the list for two days the system is still valid and not totally broken.<br><br>2.) Thus cycling during the day is done on three kind of lists: today closed, today open, yesterdays unfinished.  This according a new to be published Fosterian scanning algorithm</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2010 at 11:49 | Damien</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@ Damien<br><br>My guess is quite similar<br><br>1. DIT on today<br>2. Backlog (through a potential AF style or Backlog "Ã  la DIT") on past days (Closed lists not completed)<br>3. New tasks on DIT Today (under closed list line) if I really want to achieve it the same day; tomorrow if not clear date constraints; on appropriate date if I know right now I can't tackle before<br>4. Any task I worked on is marked  "done" and re-enter appropriately (3.).<br><br>Well, at least, it is the way I do it today!<br>Pascal</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2010 at 12:28 | Pascal</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>How about:<br><br>1. Use a daily diary book.<br><br>2. Start the day by reading through your list for the day, and then drawing a line at the end. You then process the list in AF1 fashion -- go back to the top and carefully go down through each item.<br><br>3. After you have taken action on a task, if there is still work left to be done on that task, then you need to decide: Do I want to keep working on this later today? If yes, cross the item off, and add it again below the line. If no, then you need to decide when you want to take further action -- the default would be "tomorrow". Add the task to the Task Diary on the appropriate date.<br><br>4. When no more items stand out on Today, go back to the oldest date with active tasks still on it. Process the page in AF1 fashion, aiming to close the page by actioning or dismissing all the remaining tasks. When the page is closed or nothing more stands out, move on to the next page with active tasks and so on until you arrive back at Today. Repeat as necessary until all tasks completed or the day ends.<br><br>5. As new work arrives during the day: If it MUST be done today, then add it to today's Open List (below the line). If it cannot be done till some future date, then add it to the Task Diary for that date. Otherwise, add it to your list for tomorrow.<br><br>Any closer, Mark?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2010 at 14:44 | Wooba</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Damian:<br><br>1) Wrong<br><br>2) Wrong</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2010 at 15:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Pascal:<br><br>1, 3 and 4 right (but I've already said that, haven't I?)<br>2.
