I'm not sure how "replenishing two tasks" vs "doing all three tasks" encourages choosing difficult or high resistance tasks. Help? Merci.<br><br>"Q. Why replenish two tasks at a time? Why is that better than doing all three tasks and then adding three new ones?<br><br>A. If I do all three tasks in one go, then the first of the new tasks has no distance. That means that it will probably be an easy “filler”. Once I’ve decided on one easy filler then it’s likely that I’ll go on chosing easy tasks. It’s important that all the tasks I choose have distance at the time of choosing. It means I am more likely to choose a task because it is right rather than because it is easy."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2014 at 14:29 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I'm not sure how "replenishing two tasks" vs "doing all three tasks" encourages choosing difficult or high resistance tasks &gt;&gt;<br><br>In my early days of time management I used to advise people (and still do sometimes) to write down the one task they were going to do next and then do it. The rationale behind this was that it stopped them from just mindlessly drifting into the next task. Instead, they had to make a conscious decision (emphasis on "conscious").<br><br>I then discovered that it worked better if they wrote two tasks down, did them both and then wrote another two. It seemed that the second task was usually a more "significant" task than the first. I decided that the reason for this was that the first task had to be done straightaway, but there was a time  gap ("distance") before doing the second task. This made the second task less threatening than the first, which allowed for it to be a more difficult task.<br><br>I experimented with various numbers of tasks to see how far this effect extended. I found that three was the optimum number. Above three, resistance tended to build up against the inflexible nature of the list, negating the positive effect of "distance".<br><br>However there was still a problem in that when I wrote three tasks down, the first task still had to be done straight away. This lack of "distance" for the first task generally meant that it tended to be a filler and only the second two tasks were significant.<br><br>Then I worked out that I could avoid this by replenishing the list back up to three tasks whenever it dropped to one. That way I was never writing down a task which I had to do immediately (except for the very first task of all). In other words all tasks had "distance" when written down, but the list was short enough not to build up any resistance.<br><br>This makes the process of developing SMEMA sound more straightforward and purposeful than it actually was, but I hope you get the picture.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2014 at 15:12 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark - you're the mad scientist of task lists.

"<br><br>Geez, Avrum you just finished the two week trial a week ago on the 12th. That makes 3 weeks total you've been on SMEMA. You must have a very high turn over rate for testing systems if 3 weeks seems like a long time.  I hope this is the one that works for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 February 2014 at 22:49 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Learning - my honeymoon phase with productivity systems ranges from 10 minutes to 4 days. 7 days?

Also, sometimes when I go off the rails, it's nice to have a simple system to guide me back to normal.  Your system is even simpler so you should do very well with it.  I'm still always on the lookout for little tips and workarounds to make things easier or serve special circumstances.  You're lucky that you won't need any of that with SMEMA.  I wish I could do SMEMA dependably but I can't.  I'm glad that it does for you what I wish it did for me.

In other words, looking back did you feel that you achieved what you set out to achieve? And, as a secondary question, do you think you would have achieved as much using any other system (or none)?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2014 at 16:28 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>&lt;&lt;did you feel that you achieved what you set out to achieve? ... do you think you would have achieved as much using any other system (or none)?&gt;&gt;<br><br>Good questions. Curious - how do you tackle these type of questions? Do you discuss this with your wife? A coach/therapist? I'm assuming you rely on feelings i.e. I feel my day went better with AF, SMEMA, Randomizer, etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2014 at 16:45 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>avrum:<br><br>I don't think I actually spend a lot of time trying to answer questions like that, and I certainly don't discuss them with my wife, coach or therapist (the last two don't exist in any case).<br><br>I think the feeling is based on how well everything is under control. If I am up to date with my work and am confident that I'm going to meet any approaching deadlines without stress, then I would feel that I'd achieved what I've set out to achieve. So it's not a purely subjective feeling.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 February 2014 at 22:49 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
