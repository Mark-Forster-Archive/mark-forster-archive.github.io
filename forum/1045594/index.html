I've done this with scheduling morning classes or committing to eating breakfast with friends everyday while in college, or making time to go to the fitness center or walk before work.  I know that if I'm not tired at 11, I won't go to sleep at 11, even if I need to get up super early the next day compared to normal.  <br><br>So my suggestion is, have a reason why you have to get up before 9 every morning (or earlier if you have to), and get up that early everyday, regardless of how late you were up the night before.  Eventually, you'll have to sleep earlier or wear yourself out.<br><br>Maybe you could make this a team effort with your wife, since she has to get up earlier than you.  A commitment to breakfast together everyday, perhaps?<br><br>I think you have a good handle on what to do in the evenings to make staying up less pleasant, but if you know you can sleep late every day you'll find some reason to stay up late.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2010 at 21:03 | Jessica</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The other option is to acknowledge that you are a night owl and schedule your life accordingly--which is what some of my family have done</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2010 at 21:04 | Jessica</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One thing I found VERY effective: Cancel cable and internet service.

Avrum, why do you want to go to bed at 11? It's possible you're not that committed to doing so. I find it easier to get up at the same time than to sleep at the same time.

Look at my dishes. Some people love doing them; others hate doing them and both groups do their dishes. No magic here. They simply engage in gross motor movements.<br><br>I hate doing them. I used to be concerned about the fact I hated doing them and the fact I didn't do them as much I "should". I used to procrastinate. I other words I wasn't doing my dishes when I didn't want to but thought I should.<br><br>Then I realized. I hated doing them and didn't want to do them. So I didn't. Eventually, I would want to do them, because I needed a plate or didn't care for the smell. And eventually after gradually (through exposure to use your language) I found them less and less difficult to do. Heck I even like doing them nowadays.<br><br>Never did I hack or whatever. I got honest and just did them when I wanted to.<br><br>The other tactic would have been just to get up and do them. I have to do this at times for other things. I don't need hacks or excitement about doing the task. <br><br>The oil in my car was due to be changed according to the care manual. I hate this. So I took the other tact, since waiting till I "want" to do something might mean waiting after my car blows up. I got up and did a bunch of motor movements and just about as I was finishing, I found myself "motivated" and excited about doing it.<br><br>What else is there to do?<br><br>You want to be in bed at 11? Go to bed at 11. I bet you $10,000 I am capable of getting into my bed tonight at 11 or any other time you suggest.<br><br>Falling asleep at 11 is another matter.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 March 2010 at 21:22 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;...is there anything you find difficult that another finds easy?

Nietzsche is only understood properly when done so incorrectly. Was mixing my metaphors.<br><br>Two quotes the old Kraut wrote:<br><br>"The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth.... Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope over an abyss ... what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end."<br><br>"There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, and, of its many rungs, three are the most important. People used to make human sacrifices to their god, perhaps even sacrificing those they loved the best. . .Then, during the moral epoch of humanity, people sacrificed the strongest instincts they had, their 'nature,' to their god; the joy of this particular festival shines in the cruel eyes of the ascetic, that enthusiastic piece of 'anti-nature.' Finally: what was left to be sacrificed? In the end, didn't people have to sacrifice all comfort and hope, everything holy or healing, any faith in hidden harmony or a future filled with justice and bliss? Didn't people have to sacrifice God himself and worship rocks, stupidity, gravity, fate, or nothingness out of sheer cruelty to themselves? To sacrifice God for nothingness - that paradoxical mystery of the final cruelty has been reserved for the race that is now approaching: by now we all know something about this. -</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 March 2010 at 7:52 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Why did you not want to sleep at first Norman?<br><br>I've always thought that the best cure for insomnia is to become a subsistence farmer; no late night distractions, guaranteed sleep and killer abs to boot!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 March 2010 at 9:39 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for all the suggestions. <br><br>From the atheists to the disgruntled psychiatric survivors, from the AF'ers to the Orthodox DIT'ers, y'all are a great community.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 March 2010 at 14:59 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>New thought, gleaned from Jack Canfield and others: Write down the reason you want sleep at 11:00.

Then when your watch beeps 11:00, review your reason and make a choice:<br>(a) go with it, or <br>(b) Say "I choose to watch Jay Leno (or continue writing my magnum opus) and don't care that I won't be able to function at work."

I didn't want to be tired and I also didn't want to go to sleep. I was thinking like a child. <br><br>I didn't like what I was doing for a living. So I rewarded myself by making "the most" of my time away from work. This made work more unbearable and I made even more most of my time. Again, childish thinking.<br><br>These among others reasons informed my behavior. Getting clear about my fears and anxieties and honest about how exhausted I wanted to be vs. living in a fantasy world, I had two choices:<br><br>Accept the exhaustion and stop whining and stop looking for hacks and begin to simply enjoy completely what I was forsaking sleep for and accept the consequences of my exhaustion.<br><br>Or go to bed and accept what I would be missing by being more rested. Sleep hygiene is quite clear. And works for 99.9% of everyone. Just like eating less works for everyone who wants to lose weight. People just want the world to conform to their desires.<br><br>I had decades of practice of being an "insomniac" so I spent a few months practicing to be a "regular" sleeper.

I too have done the 'making the most of time away' by staying up way too late as well.<br><br>I think people often fail to change smoking, eating, sleeping behavior because they're not giving it 100%, that is, one hundred percent.<br><br>By not wanting to give it 100% in order to spend 20% elsewhere, then 'force of habit' is far more likely to overwhelm efforts to change.<br><br>Thanks Avrum for sharing your plans too. <br><br>The only thing I can add is to maybe to make things a bit more of a 'ritual' in a way with more physical actions, sensations, Eg make bedtime drink, putting a few things away, etc</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2010 at 16:14 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>smileypete:<br><br>"I think people often fail to change smoking, eating, sleeping behavior because they're not giving it 100%, that is, one hundred percent"<br><br>I think it is because they truly don't want to and won't admit it. It is sad too, because especially with folks who smoke and eat since they usually punish themselves with every bite or puff.<br><br>Was around a handful of smokers this weekend (we treat them like lepers in the States). Each commented at least once about how they "shouldn't" be doing it and it will kill them. What a drag (pardon the pun)! I love to smoke. One of my favorite things in the world. <br><br>I don't smoke though. I suggested that they quit punishing themselves and simply admit they are going to smoke right now and enjoy it. They believe if they "punish" themselves enough, they will stop. (please don't break out the technical definition of "punishment used by shrinks).<br><br>I used to smoke 2-3 packs a day. Loved every one of those cigarettes. <br><br>Here is how I quit and works everyone, every time:<br><br>1.) I put the cigarette out I was smoking.<br>2.) Did not smoke another.<br>3.) Kept doing 2.<br><br>And I was one of those strange folks who loved every aspect of smoking. Grew up around tobacco and had used it in some manner since I was eight or so. My body would wake up in the middle the night just so I could get that cigarette to tide me over till morning.<br><br>As I have said a million times elsewhere, honesty was key. I made the decision to quit in the middle of the last cigarette I smoked. I didn't even finish it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2010 at 18:17 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Btw, I got the midichlorians for these Jedi mind tricks from Reynolds' constructive living stuff.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2010 at 18:20 | Norman U.</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
