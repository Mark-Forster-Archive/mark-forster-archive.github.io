I try to do the morning pages, as per the Artist's Way, although I'm not absolutely consistent.  I remember the author saying that you can throw the pages away after writing them if you want, which then puts the focus on the process that you go through in journaling rather than the journal pages as a product.  Although I keep the pages, I try to approach these pages as throw aways, which loosens up my thinking.  I think the point of doing the morning pages is to get things flowing, to get in touch with yourself on whatever level you're present.  I find this extraordinarily helpful.<br><br>I also like to read about other methods or goals of journaling, such as general problem solving and working through work problems.

I used to do it. But of the many creativity-enhancing techniques out there, I can only choose a few. I opt for meditation, mind-mapping and the odd journal entry when the spirit moves me. I used to burn up all my writing drive in morning pages, and not end up writing the things I wanted to/needed to; and I never seemed able to mine the pages for ideas later on; life was too full and I didn't enjoy returning to them. YMMV - give it a go and see.<br><br>In addition, the whole Artist's Way wasn't for me in the end. She tells you to do exercises like take yourself on a weekly Artist's date. At the time I lived alone, worked alone, and didn't need to do one more thing alone. She says her morning pages are her meditation. I'm sorry, but though they may alter consciousness, for me they can't replace the power of meditation. For someone who has trouble thinking divergently/acting spontaneously/ or other barriers I can't think of, it would be great. For me, I needed to stop doing Artist's Way, and actually do art. <br>Sorry for my negativity - it really was this strong a realisation for me at the time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 7:17 | Savitri</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Savitri,<br><br>I have to agree that meditation is perhaps the most powerful tool in my kit.  It stabilizes my life and keeps me focused, centered, and aware of what is important.<br><br>I never did get the artists way thing either.  I have not identified why, it just seemd a bit contrived.  It worked for her but I just did not see how it would work for me.<br><br>And your last observation is really golden.  "If you would be a writer ... write!"

The whole "state depending memory" business wipes out any good information I get from dreams a few moments after I awaken.  If I start describing the dream IMMEDIATELY, it transitions the thoughts into the fully awake state so I can have them there and think more about what they are telling me.  Very helpful at times.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 8:36 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting subject, certainly with the, dreaming - first thing in the morning, aspect that brings it closer to automaticity.

It doesn't fit my lifestyle right now, but if I have a very impressive dream, I try to capture some images of it in a journal. I also think there are times in life when we are closer to the unconscious - I journalled when I was pregnant, but haven't recently. Maybe I should! It doesn't have to be Morning Pages.<br><br>I have also used a dream image as central image in a mindmap with really profound results. The dream and the essay I was working on seemed to interact, and the mindmap drew that all out; also helping me retain the rich feeling of the dream - and in a more pleasurable way for me than just writing.<br><br>Damien, that's very interesting - who's Boyce?

It's a sad state of affairs that most psychotherapy programs ignore dreams.  Hell, my wife finished a 5 year psychiatry program - in a hospital that supports psychodynamic psychotherapy - without learning much about dreams. <br><br>I never paid much attention to dreams. However a year or so before I got married, I had a particular anxious/troubling dream. I was very fortunate to have a therapist who was trained in, and respected, dream work. He taught me not to get too caught up in the content, stick with the emotive texture, and ponder the events leading up to the dream. Moreover, because we worked together for a couple of years, he had a solid understanding of the snares and goblins with which I struggled. It would not be too preposterous to suggest that one disturbing dream, and a qualified therapist, provided a commitment-phobic mid-30s male to cautiously embrace emotional intimacy.

And I still do, the way some people do it.  I don't believe that dreams have a universal "language", and yet there is a kind of universality to some elements.  I think that the closer you get to basic emotions in a dream the closer you get to a "message" of some kind.  I do believe that Freud had it right when he uttered that famous cigar line.<br><br>I think dream work is most successful if you (as a therapist) don't analyze it but just ask the patient what HE thinks it all means.  After all it is HIS dream so HE is probably best qualified to say what it means.  It is also likely that he will miss the obvious point of it some times, but sometimes all it takes is a few well phrased questions.<br><br>As for my dreams, they seem to come from two sources that I can think of right now.  Either I'm struggling with something in my life and I'm getting feedback from my subconscious; or I've been trying to solve some kind of intellectual problem ... and that really amounts to the same process so maybe it is actually only one source.<br><br>Sometimes I'll wake up thinking: "WOW, what a bizarre dream that was.  Who knew elephants could fly Boeing 74s's"  I will wonder about that a moment and then forget it.  Most often, I'll remain in a quasi sleep state as I am about to wake up ... it seems for hours while some long thing plays out.  It is those that are the most interesting to me.  They usually have the answer to something I've been puzzling over.  If I don't keep them going as I wake, they are lost.  So I start writing immediately, going over and over the story line until I'm fully awake and the story is now part of my waking sate and I can properly analyze it.<br><br>Interesting stuff.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 18:53 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt; I always thought dream analysis was dumb.<br>Yowzee, tell us how you really feel Mike :) I'd say that people who analyze their dreams vis dream dictionaries aren't aware (or have access to) the more subtle forms of dream work. <br><br>&gt;&gt; I don't believe that dreams have a universal "language", <br><br>I agree. The metaphors and symbols that appear in our dreams have to do with our cultural/environmental surroundings.

I'm now starting to do what I knew I'd have to do anyway: try it for myself. I've made it my current initiative, in my standard way: assigning 15 minutes at the beginning of the day for a five-day stretch, and then seeing where to go from there. And this first morning has just consisted of thinking around the topic - running way over the 15-minute limit - and reading over this thread, and generally psyching myself up to launch into the activity.

I suppose I feel they give me permission to opt out of the activity later without feeling I've mis-handled something that any right-thinking person should benefit from.<br><br>I'll let you know how it goes.<br><br>Thanks again.<br><br>Chris</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 August 2009 at 8:24 | Chris Cooper</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Chris,<br><br>Just a suggestion ... decide WHY you want to journal before you begin.

However, I'm an Enneagram type 5, and that type tends to "go inside" when under stress.  That would lead me to ruminate and withdraw further from the world and into my own mind and I'd build mountains out of molehills - which free-journaling made worse.  That's why I would suggest guided journaling for anyone who has that tendency.  For a couple of years, I also did a simple evening journal technique of listing and writing about everything I was grateful for.  That was a great experience.  Ruminative, yet in a positive way.<br><br>I also did sentence completion every morning for another couple of years based on Nathaniel Branden's books.  It was tremendously helpful, I can't say enough good things about it.  It should take about 10 minutes a day.  Here's an example:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/articles_essays/instructions.html#">http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/articles_essays/instructions.html#</a><br><br>For anyone who's interested in having more vivid dreams, I found melatonin is a dream enhancer.  You use it to fall asleep more easily - unfortunately that's not my problem when it comes to sleep :-), and it boosts serotonin levels.  When using it, it was the only time I would even remember my dreams.  Sadly, they weren't as fascinating as elephants flying airplanes.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 August 2009 at 4:52 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike - and also Jim, whose post I saw just after writing what's below:  thanks for this. I decided to answer by doing this morning's journalling as a response. Here it is - but minimally tidied up for intelligibility and because I can't bear to show my typos to the world:<br><br>---<br><br>Mike suggests several possible motives for wanting to journal and suggests I get clear about why I want to do it before I set out on the practice. Well, the one that rings true, I think, is solving a problem - the problem of self-reflection, of getting an overview of myself, my life and where I'm going. It's all too easy to live from day to day and from task to task, without drawing [I meant "consulting"!] a roadmap - or without even drawing one to begin with.  It's especially easy with a TM system like AF, which enables me to process and dispose of all sorts of ideas, projects and provisional or tentative goals and feel clear and light about the way they're being handled. If I forget to include the task "Stand on mountain-top and survey my life", I may never notice the lack. In fact, I see journalling as leading into regular diary-keeping, which I've only practised fitfully throughout my life.<br><br>As for creativity, which Mike also mentions as a possible aim of journalling -  well, I suppose I imagine that I'll always be able to find ways of being creative in any particular project I take on. But I'm not sure that's necessarily true.  Take the case of guiding at XYZ. Being sunk in the mire of preparing for it, I'm not doing it with the simple efficiency and practicality that I always find it so easy to imagine myself commending to someone else. Obvious cue for an exercise: imagine myself as Head Guide, giving advice to a starter like me.<br><br>---<br><br>I typed that with the PC screen switched off. It came out like this - a bit formal, a bit over-polished. Well, writing is my trade, and I was conscious of addressing the piece to this thread of the forum. So it's not actually a piece of let-it-rip, full-blooded journalling!<br><br>Chris</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 August 2009 at 7:45 | Chris Cooper</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jim and Mike between them have suggested these possible motives for journalling:<br><br>1 - Develop creativity (Artist's Way)<br>2 - Keep track of life's events<br>3 - Record personal development<br>4 - Record travel experiences<br>5 - Analyse dreams<br>6 - Think about and solve problems<br>7 - Clarify my experience<br>8 - Get in touch with my true feelings<br>9 - Discover what I feel called (at the level of my deepest self) to undertake<br><br>I'd say 1, 4, 5 are the only ones that don't loom large for me at the moment.

How would I name my true feelings?  Let me articulate these "inner stirrings".<br><br>If you sense there might be value in this approach, I would not encourage you to share it on the forum.  The prospect of sharing might inhibit your inner frankness.<br><br>But if you do it well, you might well find yourself saying:"Wow! I didn't know that was going on in me.  This is real self-discovery".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 August 2009 at 8:20 | Jim (Melbourne)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jim hit the nail on the head, I think.<br><br>One other thought: do you think you might benefit by a traditional goal setting exercise?  I benefited greatly from following exactly the program in Allan Lakein's book.  I did that in the very early '70's and it has made all the difference.  I have updated my long term goals list every year on my birthday and I consult it monthly when I do my monthly review.<br><br>In case you've not read about it it is quite a thorough exercise.  It takes several days of work (on and off, leaving some time for percolation) to get the list in good shape, then much longer to hone it to a fine edge ;-)<br><br>I won't describe the exercise here (unless you really want me to) but the output of it is a prioritized list of your long term goals.  Being who I am (of course ;-) MY output was that list broken down by time period into the following periods:<br><br>- Lifetime<br>- 20 years<br>- 10 years<br>- 5 years<br>- 3 years<br>- 2 years<br>- 1 year<br>- 6 months<br>- 3 months<br>- Next Month<br>- This Month<br>- Next Week<br>- This Week<br><br>As you can see, I spend a lot of time in the present looking at goals which drive my current task list, but those are derived from the longer time periods.  My weekly review centers on the last three buckets and my list of current projects and actions.  My priorities are top down and kept in alignment by my monthly review which looks at the whole structure and concentrates on the yearly and monthly time frame.<br><br>So, as a concrete example:<br><br>At the top I might have broad generalizations about living an adventurous life.  The I ask myself what I mean by that and it would generate some goals in the 20 year time frame (like maybe "Climb Mt. Everest ;-).  But what would I have to do by the 10 year mark to make that happen?  And so on.  As it gets more near term (one year or less, mostly) I am in what would be called the "project" level.  And projects have monthly milestones which I can only reach by completing some things this week or next ... and then I'm at the action level.  So, what I am going to do today is governed by my long term goals or life's necessities.  For example, my schedule for today is:<br><br>- Read for about four hours (which is in my lifetime learning program, in general, and some specific sub goals in particular ... such as languages and history)<br><br>- Go to hardware store for materials for project which will improve my home which leads to happiness with my current living environment as well as equity appreciation which leads to long term financial goals<br><br>- Mop the kitchen floor -- which I can link back in a similar way but really just comes down to those pesky things one has to do ;-)<br><br>O.K.  I hear the chorus laughing that no one plans their life that far in advance ... after all, things change and who would want to plan for what might never happen?  Well, I do, and I can tell you that my lifetime goals have been remarkably stable and I'm on track for most of them.  Some have now changed in scope a bit.  (Age takes it toll ;-)  But in some incarnation or other, my goals have either been accomplished or I'm on track to accomplishing them.  Now, when they are hauling my remains off to a hole in the ground somewhere will they be saying "Poor sap, he enver did reach  his goal of climbing Mt. Everest!"?  Yes, I'm sure some will see it that way.  But I'm reminded of Feynman ... "Tuva or Bust!"  I really got that!  LOL ;-)<br><br>The whole point of goals is not to reach them, but to journey toward them.<br><br>Just some early morning ramblings ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 August 2009 at 11:35 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jim, Mike - <br><br>In haste (gotta get to bed) - thanks for your thoughtful replies.<br><br>Jim - don't worry - I won't be journalling in public!<br><br>Mike, I'm impressed by your ability to carry through with that top-down planning.

(Learning: hope you are feeling better!! Also following your thoughts on the other thread very closely!) <br><br>Through the years I've done intense journalling on and off. Currently, for getting a grasp on my own "bigger picture" I've been using mindmaps (Novamind) to do my journalling and just keep reviewing and growing my mindmaps so I can "see" better. Some issues look differently from one day/week/month to the next and "journalling" via a mindmap really helps me to view a particular problem over time .. seeing the challenges which come up, the solutions I've tried, the progress, insights or complications I see now which I couldn't see before, etc. And the advantage is that I can see it all in a "big picture" format. I particularly like using Novamind because I can have various related maps all in the same file, (just click on a tab to view another) plus the program is flexible enough to be able to add long text blocks (which can be hidden or not) and of course they can be as large as I want. <br><br>Anyway, thanks to everyone for their contributions to this very interesting discussion!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 August 2009 at 18:32 | Bev</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I journal daily using a form I learned from Mark's book 'How to make your dreams come true'.<br><br>I dialog with my 'future' self.

I've just read over the 10-minute journallings that I've done first thing in the morning over the past few days, and it's reminded me of the value of diary entries of any kind. They're full of detail that I'd already forgotten in that short span of time. <br><br>They're quite conventional pieces of prose - not the sort of wild stream of consciousness I expected and rather hoped for.
