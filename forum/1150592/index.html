Would anyone be interested in a Beta Test of DO IT, like what Mark did with AF?  I would provide the ebook for free to a limited number of people.  The only thing I would ask is that people follow the program exactly as it is laid out for say 30-45 days and then write a concise review of the program and if it helped them to achieve or get closer to the three desired outcomes (goals) they identified during the program.  <br><br>DO IT is not a time management program so you would continue to use whatever time management program you are using for "everyday" time management and run DO IT in parallel.  So when you are working on your three desired outcomes, you would be using the DO IT method.  <br><br>Please let me know your thoughts on participating in this experiment.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 June 2010 at 15:55 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am interested in a system for setting and following goals, if it matches the way I think.

I wonder how much time this has wasted...<br><br>I'm going to make a commitment now to run with the programme for 30 days starting tomorrow (really) and then I will feedback how I got on. <br><br>The difficulty I had before was in implementing Do It whilst operating a daily system like AF. I can't manage anymore without a daily system. How sad...Anyway I have cobled together an approach (using Mark Forster's ideas mainly - thank you again Mark) that should not compromise Do It, so see you in 30 days!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2010 at 21:54 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon,<br><br>I truly think the best way is to use a time block and simply "wall off" DO IT from your daily TM stuff.  If you can manage even a small block of time for DO IT, I think you will make progress.  The hardest part is the initial work to get the three desired outcomes and the whole resources gap part.  I think you will find that once you are rolling it will come easy and you will make a lot of progress.  <br><br>Even if people are not using DO IT, the truth is to make our larger life goals happen we need to find the time to work on them, which is often easier said than done.  I myself need to get out a new notebook and get the new stuff going.<br><br>Gerry<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.desiredoutcomes.info">http://www.desiredoutcomes.info</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 July 2010 at 22:21 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Gerry,<br><br>I'm on day two now!

In 2 of my 3  goals, I have made some very good progress.  No doubt, I am much further ahead than I would have been otherwise. <br><br>What hasn't  work well:<br>I am unable to consistently make progress on all 3 goals every day.  There were many days where I simply could not make the time for them.  Also, travelling for work precluded my ability to continue every day.  <br><br>The goals I chose were probably too ambitious.  In retrospect, I should have scaled back the size of my goals.  Each goal was probably do-able in 100 days, but not all 3 together given the time I have available.<br><br>For future 100-day cycles, I will give a lot more thought up-front on what the goals should be.  Doing anything for 100 days is a big commitment.   The 3 goals that are chosen must be ones that I really, REALLY WANT to accomplish.    A strongly burning desire is required for a 100 day journey.  <br><br>So, in summary , I will try this in the future, but with my eyes wide open on the size of the goals to pursue and with an up-front check on my motivation for the goal.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 August 2010 at 1:51 | Paul B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Paul B,<br><br>Thanks for the feedback.  There is no requirement to do something on each goal each day.  Also, the 100 days is just the size of most notebooks there are goals that will be worked on for years for some people like get a medical degree, write a novel, launch a business.  I agree one must really be focused on the goals since you are involved with them almost everyday, which is of course why the program works.  Again thanks for participating, this is really great feedback.<br><br>Gerry<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.desiredoutcomes.info">http://www.desiredoutcomes.info</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 August 2010 at 2:31 | Gerry</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
