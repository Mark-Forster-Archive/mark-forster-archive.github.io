As for me, I'm going to finsh my third and final task of the day and then put my feet up ;)<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://americandigest.org/mt-archives/005071.php">http://americandigest.org/mt-archives/005071.php</a><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 July 2009 at 21:17 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>try <a rel="nofollow" href="http://americandigest.org/mt-archives/005701.php">http://americandigest.org/mt-archives/005701.php</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 July 2009 at 21:53 | refragable</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One should make things as simple as possible, but not simpler. (Einstein said this, I think.)<br><br>Anyone who gets by with just three tasks per day won't need task lists at all, in my opinion.<br><br>And regarding the time and energy going into discussions of the details of task management: Well, one may joke about it. But any task management system is a tool, it's handling has to be learned properly (as its a very fundamental tool), and DETAILS COUNT.<br><br>It's like learning to drive a car. When you start, it's THE subject, and you even dream about steering wheels and shifting gears. And you discuss a lot, of course. But ten years later, you hardly ever even think about how to drive a car, let alone engage yourself in hot discussions: You JUST DRIVE.<br><br>That's the point to achieve. This "Not Insane To Do-List" thing seems more like a joke, as if one would say "OK, I settle for driving only in first gear."<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 11:21 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's very similar to the $60,000 "secret" to being successful, which consists of writing down the six most important things you have to do each day. That's been around for at least 50 years<br><br>The only problem is that it doesn't work. What are the three most important things I could do today?<br><br>Fix dates for seminars<br>Write proposal for new book<br>Install shopping basket on website<br><br>Now any fool can see that all three of those are going to generate quite a lot of work. Certainly more than 15 items a week. And much of this work will be of the mundane "Answer email", "Call Bill re ad banners" type which is never going to make the top three.<br><br>I think Leon will be back!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 July 2009 at 11:43 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think something like this can be helpful if someone is completely overwhelmed by what they would like to do. I imagine those who are going through some rather difficult times and find themselves experiencing a great deal of lethargy or depression could find this helpful.<br><br>Another thing about this sorta "system" is that you don't have to stop with three. Again, it could helpful to get the ball rolling after you have been less than effective for some time.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 11:43 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman makes a good point - a long list can be overwhelming.  I am coming to realise though that there seems to be two distinct ways of viewing those lists and that that impacts on people's views and management of AF, whether 1 or 2.<br><br>I think the difference is whether we view the list as "things to be done" or "tasks, ideas and possibilities".  If we see the list as "things to be done - which is of course a very practical and logical approach, then the longer the list the greater the sense of overwhelm.  If however the list is more of a collecting point - a memory aid for everything, then the length of the list becomes to a degree irrelevant (although method of working it may become more of an issue).  <br><br>I definitely fall into the latter category. I "know" I have things to do but if they are not defined on a list, no matter how long that list may be, I have a constant sense of unease.  I am far, far less stressed by the thought that I have 2,394 things to do which are a,b,c, d,etc than "I have so much to do".  Clearly others would be freaked out by that concept and no doubt the thought of my 60+ active pages in AF1 would have had them running screaming for the hills.<br><br>The great thing about this forum is that it enables all of the different approaches to looked at, perhaps even identified for the first time, and solutions found.  What works for one will not work for everybody but you can bet that it will definitely work for more than just the one!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 12:39 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>that's an interesting thought. So  there are todo lists for things to be done in order to achieve an outcome, and there are mind dump lists for "tasks, ideas and possibilities". <br><br>Do you think that AF2 is more on the todo list side and AF1 is more on the mind dump list side?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 12:52 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh Mark, you know me so well! Just one last comment...<br><br>No offence / poking fun intended to anybody - I guess I got annoyed with myself for spending so much time thinking about doing stuff without getting a great deal done:). And for me any sort of long list with rules to follow seems to make me feel confused and overwhelmed.<br><br>The "not insane" To Do List seems to be working for me because one of my three tasks for most days (but not every day) is to deal with yesterday's incoming work in a batch, which is basically Mark's teachings in Do It Tommorow. I put reviewable items in my diary and deal with these in the same way. There seems to be plenty of flexibility for dealing with urgent queries without any fuss and I seem to be upto date with all my work. Tasks can be carried over to the next day if unfinished so there is flexibility, but at the same time there is a sense of accomplishment from completing a task fairly quickly. <br><br> Thinking about it, I guess I have  slightly 'tweaked' this very basic time management system with Mark's innovative ideas from DIT. I probably would not have done this if I'd not observed Mark and others on the Forum seeking and discussing constant improvement.    <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 14:38 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi AndreasE...I believe Einstein did say 'One should make things as simple as possible, but not simpler'. A good observation. But consider the following, <br><br>'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication' (Leonardo da Vinci) :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 15:01 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Rainer<br><br>That's an interesting question and my instinctive reaction is that there should not necessarily be any difference between the tasks put into AF1 or AF2.  In fact I have noticed that my tasks are entered differently (in that I do not need to add so many duplicates for routine items within AF2) but basically the type of item is consistent.  AF is designed to work well with mind dump type lists in that there is no need to grade tasks but it seems that a lot of people a finding that they are feeling a need to grade within AF2 more than with AF1.<br><br>My feeling is that it is not so much the list itself but the perception of a list and how it "should" work. I love the fact that everything I need to do, from a tax return to entering a telephone number into my diary, can be on one list.  That is what is important to me.  I love seeing progress, but to me that is best expressed as a percentage of tasks done; I can see that I am being productive in the fact that I am doing things which I have decided to do (by putting them on the list). If the perception of a to do list is more of a "this must be done and done quickly" list then that would create immense pressure the longer the list got.  <br><br>The only time I would use a more "traditional" to do list, would be say when I am working to very specific deadline, such as packing and preparing for a trip.  Then I will do a very specific list which would be in effect a check list of total must do items.  Does that help?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 15:50 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes, that does help, Christine. Thanks.<br><br>Perception, different perception of a list, and how it should work, that's it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 17:18 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>And that checklist could be sitting happily at the end of your AF2 list as you <br>(1) write it out and <br>(2) work through it.<br><br>Unless you want to let the checklist to grow in the background as you think of more things.<br><br>Same for an "Overwhelm" list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 17:30 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Will<br><br>That's a good point - interesting though my first thought was that it wouldn't work for me because I always have a very specific "last minute" list with invariably never enough time to do it comfortably, meaning before a trip I either get to bed in the "wee small hours" (or not so wee!) or keep the taxi waiting and risk missing my flight.<br><br>Then I realised - with AF that should not happen again!!!  Wheeeeeee!!!!!  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 July 2009 at 17:39 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
