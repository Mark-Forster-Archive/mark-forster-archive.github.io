It's my arrangement of moving parts that takes advantage of some classic MF ideas. It's most like GIRKIR with a small nod to the nostalgic SuperFocus, and as such I call it KeepFocus. Over time it develops a core list of routine activities and current projects, while also accommodating the free-form nature of the Long List.<br><br>One quick note about me before you consider this system for yourself: I work full-time for an employer where I keep appointments using their system. I use KeepFocus almost exclusively for personal tasks.<br><br>YMMV. Make of all this what you will.<br><br>KeepFocus<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>You will work with two lists, the Active list and the Ready list. These instructions describe starting the system from scratch.<br><br>1. You will add items as they occur to you to the end of the Ready list. The Active list begins empty. (You will gradually build the Active list by working the system.)<br><br>2. Begin by scanning the Ready list.<br><br>3. Dot an item on the Ready list that stands out, and work on it for a bit.<br><br>4. If the item requires more work, or will recur soon, move it to the Active list.<br><br>5. Continue working on the Ready list as in 3. and 4. until you reach the end. You will now switch to working on the Active list.<br><br>6. Work on the Active list by scanning, dotting, and working as usual. When re-writing tasks, put them on the end of the Active list.<br><br>7. When you reach the end of the Active list, most often you will return to the beginning of the Active list.<br><br>8. If you scan the Active list without selecting any item, go to step 2.<br><br>In summary, this system focuses on cycling through an Active list of items you're, hrm, actively working on. Items which don't need immediate attention get parked in the Ready section, and when everything that's Active is under control, you review those parked items.<br><br>NB: Nothing ever goes back on the Ready list. Items stay Active until they are complete (projects) or no longer recur (change of routine/responsibilites).<br><br>How you maintain two separate lists for this system is irrelevant. In practice, I have found the stelactite/stelagmite method a good fit. I put the Active list on top and Ready below.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2021 at 6:33 | Voluntas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Voluntas:<br><br>Congratulations on writing an extremely clear set of instructions which I was able to understand on first read-through.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2021 at 10:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Voluntas, thanks for sharing!<br><br>Do you mean by the "stelactite/stelagmite method" that you solely "put the Active list on top and Ready below" or vice versa, or is there more to this method?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2021 at 12:17 | DMT</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seems very similar to Mark's AF4 - Revised.

There's no major innovation here, just a pattern that works for me personally.<br><br>One major difference between the two systems is that KeepFocus doesn't care about how long ago you added an item to the system. It favors looking at how long since you last acted on an Active item. For me, this has the benefit of keeping me feeling good about the work that I _have_ done, rather than stressing about all the things on the list that I haven't gotten around to yet.<br><br>-V</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2021 at 15:36 | Voluntas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have been using something similar using Mark's ideas. I have an AF list down the left of the page as a "Ready" list and use "The Next Hour" process as a list down the right had side of the page (as an "Active" list). I flip between the two according to my mood. If I am feeling more driven I spend more time on the "Next Hour" process; if I feel more relaxed I scan the AF list on the left.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2021 at 15:40 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Voluntas<br><br>It looks like a good system, tempted to try it !</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2021 at 17:54 | Caibre65</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>I may not be the best writer in the world, and I'm certainly not the best designer of TM systems, but at least I understand how to edit!<br><br>-V</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2021 at 20:16 | Voluntas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Posting this on this thread because I think this system might be a good one to consider this idea.<br><br>I ran across a blog[footnote 1] about organizing notes by projects, and also organizing another list by areas of responsibilities, and a third section for resources about interests, hobbies, etc. Then I ran across a video about how hobby projects tend to die if you don't finish them quickly[footnote 2]. Between those ideas bouncing around my head, I've been thinking that maybe there should be an Active list which covers tasks related to areas of responsibility (and those areas would stay on the list because they keep going for an indeterminate time), but projects (especially personal projects) should be keep to a smaller portion of the active list so that they can be focused on to hopefully completion, or at least not left to linger when more projects are started before the previous one is completed.<br><br>Of course there are systems (like kanban) which limit the number of works in process but it doesn't really cover keeping things right across a wide spectrum of areas of responsibility.  And there are systems which are being worked on here which incorporate keeping up with areas of responsibility for an ongoing/permanent basis. Maybe there's a way to combine the two with say:<br><br>Ready list (I usually call that a feeder list), Active list (items can stay on it to cover areas of responsibility), Project list (maybe part of the active list in a different color, limited to 1-3 items perhaps).  One caveat of keeping short term focus on a project is that you do have to do some work ahead of time in order to do research, obtain parts and materials, etc. as mentioned in the video, so there is a way in which work on it is really spread over time to get ready for it. <br><br>[1] https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/ The PARA Method: A Universal System for Organizing Digital Information<br>[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72a85tWOJVY How to finish your weekend projects in one weekend.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 April 2021 at 16:28 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting that -- although I haven't read or heard of fortelabs before, nor have I read anything specifically like that blog article -- I currently am organizing my work precisely by what they call Areas of Responsibility, with Projects under them and Tasks under those.

In contrast, I think a great feature of MF-style systems is that they allow you to *discover* your priorities as you go along. Perhaps my particular situation - where the real "must-do" tasks get organized by my employer's system - gives me more flexibility in that regard.<br><br>Either way, let us know if you find my original idea satisfactory, or if you need to further divide the list to make it work for you.<br><br>-V</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 April 2021 at 21:50 | Voluntas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I haven't actually tried this out yet, being rather busy on non-time-management matters at the moment, but I have been reading through the instructions again and trying to visualise how they would work in practice.<br><br>It strikes me that the effect would be rather similar to FVP.

(F)FVP is a great system, but on days with lots of new incoming tasks, ongoing tasks (= usually the important and mostly not urgent ones) at the end of the list get easily lost between the new ones.
