It follows that our best decisions come not from trumping passion with reason or "going with the gut" but from balancing an equation built with conscious and visceral knowledge --"<br><br>Food for thought.  Thanks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 19:46 | Jim (Atlanta)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks, Jim – that does look interesting. The quoted passage contains a pretty blatant _non sequitur_, though. As (some) philosophers like to say, you can't get an ought from an is; nothing follows about how to make the _best_ decisions from claims which are purely about how decisions _in fact_ get made. (Certainly, if all our decisions get made in a certain way, and must get made that way, then it will follow that all our best decisions get made that way; but no useful advice can come from that.)<br><br>Maybe the book contains a good case that the best way of making decisions involves a balance of the relevant sort; my only point is that, if so, the review doesn't make it very clear what that case is. <br><br>Incidentally, this reminds me of a question I've been meaning to ask Mark: What role is the "rational brain" playing in Autofocus, exactly? Tasks are added to list without conscious evaluation, just because they "come to mind", so to speak; and then decisions about which tasks to do or not do, and when, are made intuitively....<br><br>(This is a question from an Autofocus fan, of course. It's not a criticism of the system; just a question about how you understand the theory behind it.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 21:21 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.

I've tried this for extended periods of time, and I can't get it to work. Maybe some can!<br><br>The rational brain could then introduces a framework to allow the intuitive mind to work but in a more disciplined fashion. There are many ways in which this can be done, of which AF is one. Rational ideas introduced into the system include closed lists, structured procrastination, and the act of writing things down itself.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 21:51 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>And doesn't the rational side become involved again at the point of dismissal?<br><br>When tasks remain undone and are dismissed then we would analyze (rational thinking?) why we are resisting them wouldn't we?<br><br>Also presumably the rational brain is involved in the 'common sense' rule with a certain amount of rational thinking involved in noticing which tasks need to be done out of sequence for practical or deadline reasons.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 22:35 | Hannah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would say the rationality comes in the structure that's created: the page, the simple rules. It's within that simple structure that the intuition is able to play freely.<br><br>It's similar in my mind to the Nathanial Branden fill-in-the-blank sentences that Mark has referred to in earlier posts. (Something like, "If I were to ______ everyday, I'd be happy.") By rationally creating this sentence, with a blank left cunningly in the middle or at the end, your imagination or intuition starts to run through its memory blanks and fill in various verbs that will complete the sentence. It becomes a bit of a game.<br><br>If you relax and just let your brain wonder about the sentence, without trying to rationally calculate an answer to fill the blank with -- if you let an answer just pop into your mind, without prompting -- then you may discover something about yourself that you couldn't have rationally figured out. <br><br>I'd say the AF list page rationally provides the sentence "I want to do ____ right now" that our intuition is silently filling in.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 22:37 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very interesting discussion. Reminds me of the "Go with the flow" chapter of GED (rivers need banks) and the "Limits" principle of DIT.<br><br>BTW, from an old-school usenet perspective, underscores are naturally _read_ as italicisation, while *this* is read as bold text. I usually use both - in this very forum and otherwise - without much thinking. Maybe I shouldn't do that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 January 2009 at 23:34 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alex:<br><br>That's the way I do it too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2009 at 9:27 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good points, Hannah – employing the "common sense override" rule can involve rational thought, and one is clearly supposed to reason about whether to reintroduce dismissed items in a rational way.<br><br>I'm not sure that talk about rational aspects of the system itself hit the target, on the other hand; but it depends on how one understands them. Clearly some rational thought went into _designing_ AF; but that doesn't mean that when someone's _using_ the system, he or she is engaging his or her "rational brain" (which I take to mean something like "is engaged in deliberate and perhaps conscious reasoning"). On the other hand, I suppose there is, or at least can be, some reasoning involved in just following the rules of the system; and that is importantly different from just doing whatever you feel like doing at any given moment, in a completely unconstrained way, as Mark points out. <br><br>Anyway, thanks for the responses.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2009 at 21:50 | Martin</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
