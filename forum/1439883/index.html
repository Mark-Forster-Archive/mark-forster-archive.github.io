Then I used and was happy with Together (<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://reinventedsoftware.com/together/">http://reinventedsoftware.com/together/</a> ) for a long time but now that I have an iPad I want the online access that Evernote provides.<br><br>So... what goes in Evernote? <br><br>Everything.<br><br>Articles I want to read, recipes, lecture note brainstorms and reflections on class afterwards. receipts for on line purchases, notes when I go to conferences, project lists and associated links, etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2011 at 11:55 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I loved Journler, except for one limitation: like an email program, you *must* sort the main view by some data column. You cannot drag and drop the items into any order you wish. Had it allowed this manual sorting, I would probably still be using it today. Yes, it does have user-defined tags (or Categories or something), which one can rig up to support arbitrary prioritization, but this suffers from the "subdividing tags" problem: what starts out as Level01, Level02, Level03, etc. becomes Level01A, Level01B, Level02AA, Level2AB, etc. as you keep trying to insert items in between others. There was no simple way to automatically renumber everything.<br><br>Does EverNote support arbitrary ordering? How is it for linking items together?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2011 at 1:52 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bernie, the entry and file linking is the major thing that I miss about Journler. No other program that I've found can do it, sadly. The sorting thing was never a major issue for me, but my Journler library was (is - I still have a bunch of data in it that I'm not willing to migrate because it's data that I coded with Journler tags) heavily organized by smart folders.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 March 2011 at 2:22 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I hear ya, Sarah.<br><br>All that linking and tagging and stuff could be pretty handily duplicated in HTML, with the right tool and storage scheme.<br><br>Imagine creating a little blog just for yourself, set to "private access" of course, and you just enter all these notes into it, including file attachments.

So, an ideal choice is a blogging tool that stores HTML on your computer's hard drive instead of a web site. Yet, this tool needs to be *simple* to use, not to get in your way when you are trying to work in "idea space." Similarly, we do not want to be coding up HTML tags for formatting or linking—even if readily know how—when we are trying to think.<br><br>Not surprisingly, Journler itself was originally a blogging tool. Evernote looked similar to me, when I read about its features, but if it does not support linking, then a major feature is missing from this perspective.<br><br>There at least seventeen zillion blogging tools out there!

I HAVE such a private little blog and have used it some for those purposes. At some point, however, the categories stopped showing up. I don't know if I initially didn't have the posts set to private or if something changed with the software, but it took me a while to figure out that the categories don't show in the sidebar on the private posts. And that defeated a lot of my purposes (which makes me think that the functionality changed on me.)  I chose to use categories and not tags, thinking that since it's just for me they work sort of interchangeably. Now I'm wondering if tags work differently. Will give it a try. Thanks for the spark of an idea.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 March 2011 at 13:00 | malisa</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm currently using "free" Google Sites ( https://sites.google.com/ ) for this. I created multiple sites, a few public, a few restricted/limited. Wikipedia ( <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Sites">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Sites</a> ) says it is "a structured wiki and web page creation tool ".  I actually bought a domain via Google , so that I can create my own subdomains for my multiple sites. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 March 2011 at 16:18 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>malisa &amp; sabre23t,<br><br>I once tried to use a Google Site as a "family wiki," basically the same idea. I found that Google's search function (incredibly!) did not work within my Google Site! On their troubleshooting forum, many people complained of the same problem, and there was no real help from Google. It stayed broken for months, and I finally jumped ship ...<br><br>... to Blogger (also owned by Google), and it was great, except that they can't insert tables, which I really wanted for some of our entries (I can write them in HTML, but as mentioned, I don't want to get sidetracked coding).<br><br>So then I moved to pbwiki.com, where I find the mechanics a little heavy, but it basically works. Reading it just isn't as nice &amp; clean an experience as reading/searching a blog. At least the info is *shared* among the family and group-editable, the major purpose of a wiki, but for my own note-taking, pbwiki is not agile enough.<br><br>Good luck with your blogs! Report back with breakthroughs and awesome tweaks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2011 at 8:09 | Bernie</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
