I have been here since those days and have gone through all of the versions of Autofocus.  I know this is not great insight, but I think the current version of Autofocus -- version 4 -- is very much a hybrid and close to what DIT was all about.  You have a backlog list you work and then your active list.  Of course the rules are different and more flexible, which I like, but when you look at the basic tenets of DIT, you see AF4 in essence!  So, Mark, we have come somewhat in a circle, back to an Autofocus version that one could say uses the basis of DIT as its foundation.  And this is why I think this version is by far the best.<br><br>Mark, am I totally off in my assessment of AF4?

I used to "use" DIT quite a bit and loved it.  Tried writing an outline to create a flow chart for it, drove part of the board insane.  Got laughed at (awww!) for being analytical and overcomplicating. . . <br><br>This AF4 is a nice hybrid progression that is MUCH, much easier to implement and keep implementing.<br><br>However, there is not a "current initiative" type of project in the AF4 that I've noticed, hoewver that is easily implementable.<br><br>peace,<br><br>Bob<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 September 2009 at 19:32 | Bob</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David,<br><br>Sounds good - so today becomes the closed list, tomorrow the open list, and yesterday's list gets reviewed.<br><br>Then cycle today's list, and also one? pass through tomorrow's list.

Without being too redundant, I, too, work better when I KNOW what I've determined I WILL DO (even through pain, I'll soldier on to at least satisfy myself to give a decent amount of accomplishment on the WILL DO determinations) and I'm also a proponent of flexibility.  I like to make room for the day to unfold while I satisfy my pretermined aims ASAP so that if something wonderful or exciting happens, I can go with the flow of it.  In 2006, I got "cured" of chancing backlogs.  I don't want to live through that guilt, worry or effort ever again if possible."  I only way I can do this, it to have a FIRM WILL DO list along with "may do" items and "surprise" items.  <br>People scoff at me, but for my situation, life works best for me when I both know what I'm aiming for and at least approximately when I'm going to do it.  The rest of my life's tasks and events is the flexibility part.<br>Also, with my limitations, my mental and physical energy is best spent on doing what I deem worthwhile.  IOW, if left to my own devises, I might waste time on optional may do things and get struck with a horrific spinal cord bout.......then I'm stuck with a backlog!  Grrrrr....I don't want that!  lol!   I do use an AF attitude after my WILL DO's are completed or use them as breaks from the intense work yet able to stay productive while I'm recharging my brain to get back to the weighty important) stuff. Scheduling and timeboxing takes care of most of it......so that I can live free.  I could never stay on list all day!  My aim is to get off list ASAP unless I've scheduled a later session of work.....or I got derailed and want to hunker down to complete my days aims.  I don't want yesterday's ghost to haunt me today.  lol  May do items are my snacks and deserts.....Will do items are my nourishment.<br>learning as I go<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 September 2009 at 13:06 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David<br><br>For the possible provenance see<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/11/17/the-simplest-time-management-method.html">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/11/17/the-simplest-time-management-method.html</a><br><br>and sprinkle some AF1 to taste</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 September 2009 at 14:23 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Learning,<br><br>Great to hear from you again! :-)<br><br>What I do now (which admittedly is not very AF like), is for each day list the will do's and next actions on the left side of a page.<br><br>Then most other things including thoughts, ideas, may do's are listed on the right side of the same page.<br><br>I also find it helpful to split the page in sections from top to bottom as needs be.

I am wondering if your mention here of Time Power is by Charles Hobbs? Curious because I just mentioned this book on another thread about Long Term Goal creation, and that I found great value from this book on the topic. And if it is the same book as you are referring to, how curious that you would make mention of it just a few days after I did! I really got a lot of good information out of that one, but don't recall what he says about managing time in the way you mention here. (I read it a while ago.) I will have to take another look.<br><br>While I'm here, I would like to let you know that many of your posts and your overall approach to managing your time (and passions!) have been a real inspiration to me. I think I, too, work best with a known daily/weekly to-do list. And while I am trying out AF (I like the most recent version the best) I find I still am inclined to work most productively when I KNOW what is it I want/need to accomplish on a given day. And so I don't do the PURE version for sure. <br><br>Back to your "system" I am wondering if you have ever (here or elsewhere) put together a post/info regarding your "overall" approach to TM. Meaning, a way to read it in one place so that one can follow along, and thus implement it as their own. I really do think you have a unique feel for TM, which certainly includes your honoring of your creative time, how you focus on the must-do tasks, how to keep those creative juices flowing, etc. Hey, maybe you "should" write an ebook or something. I'm there!<br><br>Ok, I hope you get the drift here. I like your style ;~)<br>~Beth L</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 September 2009 at 21:11 | Beth L</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Beth L.<br>Firstly, thank you for your kind sentiments.  I feel honored that I'm of some help or encouragement to you.<br>re: Time Power.  Yes, the book was written by Charles Hobbs.  I was referring to the kind gentleman who guided me to it and took the time to explain it to me.  My brain injuries left some of my learning and memory retention a bit shakey.  His name was Charles Cave I believe....or perhaps he was the gentleman who helped me learn Mark Forster's DIT.  My memory isn't too reliable.<br>Charles Hobb's approach is quite similar to my dad's.  I think most time management is fairly similar.  The true variation lie more in the person's ambitions, attitude toward his life's trajectory, his impact on his sphere of influence, how his character impacts his choices and plans, etc..... <br>I really liked Time Power for the reason that it's meta principles regarding character, meta values impacts goals formation and guides your life's trajectory.  I was fortunated to learn this very young as a child from my dad.  Charles Hobbs formalized these principles into a book and a time management process.  <br>I don't read all posts here....but I wish you'd tell me which one where you mention Time Power so that I can read it.  I truly believe that many people don't realize how important it is to be aware of how values impacts your character and ambitions even more than time management will.  I believe that honor and courage to uphold your values and honor your passions might be less expedient that opportunistic ambition.  I further believe that many people mistake principles/values  driven determination for self-discipline.  If you are passionate about something, you don't neglect it because it's difficult or boring.  Rather, it will make you more determined to do it however you can.  If your principles, values and passions are nebulous, so will be your productivity habits.  The issue isn't really if you want to enjoy the process as much as how determined you are to honor the result you desire.  I might be using different words than my dad or Charles Hobbs....but the intent is the same.  What you do and how you do it definitely reflects your character and your passions.   .....At least, that how it seems to play out in my opinion.....<br>Enough drug induced babbling.....I'll regret this post tomorrow when I can actually read it...<br>*blush*<br>I wish you a thriving and passionate lifestyle, Beth....<br>Keep up the good intentions and good results!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 September 2009 at 23:24 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>I'm actually too drugged to make much sense right now.....but....if you'll check Mark's archives, he has lots of fabulously written, heartfelt articles about nurturing both your values and your passions.  He also has articles about how to gently guide yourself back to your higher intentions when your mood tries to direct you to decide with a childish orientation.  I call my childish aspects of mood orientation my donkey (Stubborn Ass Syndrome) and my monkey ( low tolerance for boredom or irrational fears).  These guys are also my perserverance to soldier on and my natural curiosity and awe.<br>Mark explains things far more eloquently and clearly.

(I schedule some into the calendar and some I plug into my daily focus list).<br>At the risk of sounding daft......here goes.......<br>Write out the weekly aims that haven't been scheduled into your calendar and treat that as the closed list portion of your AF4 list.  For the open part of your list, create your usual daily focus list with a few maybes thrown in from your master list or fresh ideas that occur to you yet are in keeping with the overall aims of the day.<br>As you work your closed list, you are accomplishing your most important weekly aims.  Your open list can be populated with less taxing tasks that keep you in a productive flow yet allow your brain to either think further about the important stuff while you work or the task is simple enough to simply give your brain time to refresh itself!.<br>This way you can both enjoy your foray into AF4 land and still operate within a weekly format.  You have both flexibility and determined effort combined!<br>I hope this makes some sense.......It makes perfect sense in a oxycontin polluted brain!  lol!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 September 2009 at 2:37 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi, again, Smilypete<br>I didn't see your most recent post!  *blush*  Please forgive the oversight.  We seem to have quite similar methodologies.  I, too, fold my paper when I don't want to bother to get fancy with measuring lines.  I change my strategies depending on my aims and current abilities.  I'll sometimes fold the paper to create times of day to plug in work especially if it's onerous....example   before breakfast, before noon, before 3, before 5 and plus in tasks and an onerous project into doable chunks in the different quadrants of the day to add up to a decent effort for the day.  Other times, I'll use the quadrants for focus areas....example.. current initiative,.accounts, clean house/laundry, project X,  and approach them round-robin style during my work day hours.  <br>I guess you can surmise that I like to stick with the same basic principles to achieve my aims yet freshen up the procedures a bit!  I like having a variety of methods to accomplish my aims without compromising the actual intent or results.<br>I really like your dedicated yet playful approach as well!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 September 2009 at 2:47 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>oops, I forgot to answer your question.  I like to plan weekly to create a frame to accomplish my aims and meet my responsibilities with PLENTY of flex time included.  I look forward to unexpected opportunities and enjoy my pleasures as well.  My daily list is mostly a focus tool that plugs in some effort toward my weekly aims, reminds me of commitments and responsibilities, and factors in my current abilities.  The daily list allows me to laser in my focus on my intentions without having to worry about other concerns not related to the day.  If I accomplish my aims earlier than expected, I have the choice to either use the extra work time to get ahead for another day, get ahead in case a surprise occurs, or............close shop early!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 September 2009 at 3:02 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Learning.
