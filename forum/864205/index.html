I strongly recommend his book Stumbling on Happiness which goes into the issues in greater detail.<br><br>Two of the major points that I took from his book were:<br><br>1. First and foremost, we have a kind of psychological immune system that kicks in only if things get sufficiently bad. The take-home lesson is that if we try something big (like writing your novel, Jacqueline?) and fail, it's not a problem because our psychological immune system protects us. People regret inaction much more than action. Acting and failing are better (usually) than not acting at all.<br><br>2. Writing or talking about the future leads to much more accurate predictions than imagining or thinking about the future. It just might be a good idea to make detailed plans about your goals. Sure, they might not turn out exactly as you planned, but the very process itself is helpful.<br><br>Like the article mentions, he gives a ton of evidence showing how woefully bad we are at predicting what will make us happy.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2009 at 2:56 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Kahneman frequently showed up in the literature I was researching for a study I was doing around ambiguity avoidance. It's a fascinating area, quite a number of eye opening experiments done in that field. And quite a number of implications regarding time management. <br><br>I find the more interesting work of Kahneman to be about will power, a highly recommend googling topic!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2009 at 3:01 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Good Morning Jacqueline,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I've read most of his stuff, but came at it from the economics perspective after he got the Nobel rather than the psychological side. I find the blending of the two fascinating.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>The title of one of the more important works in economics is "Human Action" (Ludwig von Mises).  I have always liked that title because it summs up what economic study should really focus on.  So, in fact, economic study, when it is on point, is all about psychology.  Otherwise it is just about graphs ;-)<br><br>(Incidenly, I found it eye-opening when he talked about "suicidal behavior" in business.  Obviously, when Adam Smith and company talked about "the invisible hand" and "enlightened self-interest" they did not understand that corporations were only a "legal" person and that was in fact a "legal ficton" ... corporations don't, and can't, have any self-interest of their own ... only the self-interest of those who run them, and that one distinction explains our horrid state of affairs today.)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I think this whole fairly new area of "happiness" research is key for people to understand why they can be so poor at setting good goals for themselves. People get frustrated with the goal setting process, when maybe they should be frustrated with themselves at not having a good understanding of what really rings their chimes.<br><br>''If people do not know what is going to make them better off or give them pleasure,'' Daniel Kahneman says, ''then the idea that you can trust people to do what will give them pleasure becomes questionable.'  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>He is best when he stays away from making generalizations ... which he seems to mostly avoid. ;-)<br><br>His experiments are fascinating but what conconclusions one can draw from them becomes questionable ;-)  For example: he talks about the poor performance of financial professionals picking stocks.  Yes, that is a difficult thing to do.  OTOH, it only takes one counter example to throw the conclusion out the window and there is more than one counter example ... Warren Buffet has not done too badly ... but arguably he does not pick stocks so much as evaluate business performance ... but then Kahneman also aruges that we are bad at predicting such long term things as well.  Then there is George Soros who does (mostly, on average) correctly predict turns in currency and global economic conditions.  So clearly there are some who manage to do what he says is a difficult thing.  Obviously it is difficult, but not impossible.<br><br>I see his work as providing guidance about how to set goals, more than as a cautionary tale about avoiding setting them.  The one very telling observation (in his discussion of System 1 and System 2) was that System  1 is fast but can lead to error so we need System 2 to monitor it ... but System 2 is very weak in doing so.  Knowing that one thing can be very helpful ... along with his stressing the importance of feedback in building skill.<br><br>What all of that tells me is that one should set a goal, then test it continually as one progresses to see if it is taking one where one wants to go.<br><br>One problem that people have been having with this whole business of saying how good people are in planning thier lives is something he nibbles around the edges at ... people's "purpose" is not about planning and choosing long term happiness, etc.  We are, to use an analogy, machines the purpose of which is to survive and make the best of our experiences so that we continue to survive.  He points out that some error comes about because our minds insist on making meaning.  But then that is how they work!  It is a simple mechanism that generally produces good results in simple situations that we most often encounter and affect our survival.  It is illogical to assume causality based on temporal coincidence (the post hoc fallacy) yet in the simple survival situations that we are programmed to deal with ... it mostly works.  If you walk under a window and a piano narrowly misses you ... it is not all that bad to conclude that walking under windows is bad for your health.  Not a logical conclusion, but one that might keep you breathing a few days longer ;-)  (Obviously the rational person will draw a better conclusion ... such as it is good to look up from time to time ... but then that is the kind of thing we have to learn to do ... to draw better conclusions than the simple ones we are programmed to draw by default.)<br><br>Human action is so much about trying  to keep up wth our accelerated evolution.  We are far ahead of what nature "planned" for us.  Our survival mechanisms are still about avoiding being eaten by large kitties yet our daily struggles are about avoiding being eaten by large corporations.  Nature's mechanism of evolution has not kept up.  It can't.  It is too slow.  Instead we evolved to have minds that are maleable and allow us to learn and override our basic default programming.  (IOW, we can focus on our defaults or on our ability to override them.)<br><br>So while people are poor at predicting, that does not mean that they should not plan and strive ... it simply means that we have to learn in what ways we are poor and strive to become better at it.<br><br>What hard lessons did I take away from his talks?<br><br>- Memories of past experience are unreliable so need to be tested well before using them to plan.<br><br>- The importance of things we don't have can be exagerated.  I am thinking about moving to Arizona ... will the improvement in the weather there really make that big a change in my life?  Just how much affect will it have once I'm there?  Will I really be thinking about the wonderful weather 24/7?  What will I be mostly doing and will THAT be better there?<br><br>- It may be that I will not like the outcome once I reach a goal.  I need to keep testing how much I'm currently enjoying my journey and I need to keep modifying my goals based on that feedback.<br><br>There are many other things that I've not fully digested yet.  I'm certainly going to follow Peter's suggestion and hit the Google trail ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2009 at 10:54 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for the recommendations moises and Peter, I have flipped quickly through "Stumbling on Happiness" at the bookstore, but will request it from the library.

It gave some reasons for why the ways I've managed my finances that I've stumbled upon in the last number of years worked so well.<br><br>Here's an old article on investing which cites Kahneman's research that I read when figuring out a "blood in the streets" investing strategy after I lost a pot of money in the tech boom (which serves me right b/c I didn't know a thing about tech) - I guess my psychological immune system has protected me. :-) <br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1986/11/24/68340/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1986/11/24/68340/index.htm</a><br><br>I learned to stick with something I understood the cycle of - utilities, oil and gas - after that.<br><br>I agree with both of you, this research has tremendous implications for life and time management and I think a system that incorporated it in a practical way would be very powerful.  <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2009 at 13:02 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, we must have been cross posting - re. his research and your comments on Buffett and Soros - I think he's saying that those two ARE following what he would recommend.  I'd bought back into the market about 2 months before Buffett acknowledged that he had as well (he'd bought back in before he put it out in the press that he had/was - of course).  We were both in cash before - but my reasoning was only that I was seeing too many 52 week highs, and it didn't make sense and made me nervous.  Something had to give, especially with the oil and gas stocks where the prices were going crazy for a variety of reasons - but in businesses that rely on hedging, that can spell disaster, and did for some (including the company I worked at).  <br><br>One of my goals next year is to learn how to manage my portfolio in a more systematic way.  I think I got lucky this year with 30-40% gains, but I'm still closing my eyes and just picking a little too much.<br><br>As for the rest of your post - I hear what you're saying about the AZ move, but like you, I need to do some E5 digesting.  :-)<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2009 at 13:24 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Paper cited here is a nice starting point for will power/self regulation research<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2007/03/selfcontrol_is_a_muscle.php">http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2007/03/selfcontrol_is_a_muscle.php</a><br><br>More about why Warren Buffet is rich, uncertainty/ambiguity avoidance and more:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~rzeckhauser/investinginunknownandunknowable.pdf">http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~rzeckhauser/investinginunknownandunknowable.pdf</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 August 2009 at 15:00 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline,<br><br>It's funny that you should use this example to illustrate the functioning of the psychological immune system, since that is exactly the one Stuart uses. <br><br>Here are my notes from the book:<br><br>page 196: Scenario: You own shares of stock A. You consider switching to B, but decide against it. You now find that if you had switched to be you'd be better off by $1,200.<br><br>You also owned shares of stock C.

They think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. WRONG! People regret not having done things much more than they regret the things they did.
