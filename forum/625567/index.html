I am the author of the eBook The Simple Guide to Time Management, so I have an interest in finding most efficient way to manage and track my task.  I was in the middle of trying another self designed system and switched to AF to be a beta tester<br><br>After using the system for a full week of work, I am very impressed with it and can see that it has improved productivity for me for a variety of reasons.  It is easy to use so it actually gets used.  It is a mix of art and science which for my personality is attractive so I like it.  It is adaptable to my desire to use one tool.  It gets everything out of your mind so you can trust it (a GTD goal).  It focuses mostly on action and completing tasks which is the true goal of time management.  It seems to replace a project list. The tasks are tied to your projects, so you are in essence reviewing your commitments and projects at the task level constantly.  Additionally, it is very easy to get set up.   You can just start with a few items and the system seems to self generate the tasks.<br><br><br>Other comments and questions so far are;<br><br>The system seems to work and encourage completeness because as you go along, knowing that if you stop work on a task you may not get to work on it until several pages are gone through .<br><br>In the instructions, I would like to see some examples of entering the tasks.  I have realized how things are entered has an impact on productivity.  Using words like draft, call, email, review creates a call to action versus entries like, new tires, trip to Washington. I noticed initially I was putting “projects” down not tasks and this change improved performance.  I also have been trying to use files as opposed to piles in my office, so I will not things like review 3rd quarter report - In file cabinet ABC property 3 Q report.<br><br>I also think a clarification of continue going round is needed.<br><br>I also think notebooks can be set up for functions like work, personal life, Charity Board Member as opposed to location.  My personal notebook is not just home, as I take it with me all over.  I think it makes sense to just bring it with me so if I am at the bank and an issue arises, I do not need to write it on a scrap of paper to transfer it. <br><br> I like the moleskin type notebooks, because I like to put checks, receipts, bills etc in them, so they are right where I need them as I do the tasks<br><br>I think it may have been addresses but what happens when you can’t work on one thing on a page and you can’t dismiss the entire page.  I would assume you just go to the next page.<br><br>I also think the AF method could actually be a very powerful project planning tool.  If you are starting a business, you would be listing the tasks that need to be done and the jumping out and page scanning would allow you to intuitively work on the tasks at the appropriate time and dismiss the items that you no longer think move the project forward.<br><br>My one concern remains my waiting for items.  Many things I am involved with require me to monitor others work and the things they owe me may take several days to complete.  I have been using a W to note that I am waiting for something and then entering call Bob about report when the time is getting near.  It seems to work fine.  I like to be able to scan the lists and see the Ws as it jogs my memory.<br><br>All in all the system seems to be very intuitive and productive, thanks to Mark for sharing it.<br><br>Gerry<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 19:11 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You're right the  "" mix of art and science""  seems to be helping alot of us. <br><br>""I noticed initially I was putting “projects” down not tasks and this change improved performance""  <br>I've found a bit of the opposite effect. <br>Before AF I put tasks down on a list todo but if I had a project on my mind but didn't know where to start I'd spend days? mulling it over trying to figure out the right thing to do to start. <br>Now if an idea pops in my head I just write it down and put a ? at the end ( I'm sure that was mentioned in a post way back) eg plan vege garden? This job is huge including 12+ fruit trees rotations etc etc and would take a bit of planning just to figure out what to do first.<br><br>But I have found just putting it in AF like that "suddenly"" when I scan it the first step I need to do pops into my head. I do this step and the next step also seems to pop into my head which I write at the end of the list and the flow has started.<br><br>So in the time that before I'd still be mulling it over now I have already done 2 or more steps.<br><br>It's all very relaxing<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2009 at 5:59 | Margherita</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
