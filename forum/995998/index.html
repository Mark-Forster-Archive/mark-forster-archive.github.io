Many people have found Autofocus (and for me, AF4) to be an outstanding system.  I have heard some say that they will be very hesitant to abandon AF4 and go to a DIT system.  I must say, although there are aspects of DIT that I do miss, I have found AF4 to be a wonderful system.   WIth your new system, are you abandoning AF4 and focusing now back to DIT and your new add-on?  Or will you actively promote both systems?<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2010 at 4:00 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David:<br><br>I think you asked me exactly the same question about a year ago about whether I was abandoning DIT for AF. And my answer is exactly the same: the fact that I have introduced/amended one system doesn't mean that anyone has to follow that system and abandon something that was working fine for them. I would also continue to support all previous systems.<br><br>As for promoting systems, I haven't really done any promoting of any system outside this forum. This forum simply reflects the concerns of its posters.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2010 at 8:30 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>I'm also curious if you evolve from system to system, or choose depending on your mood. David Seah, another productivity writer, creates tons of productivity content, but has told me he no longer uses most of it. He's constantly searching, and developing, material/systems to match his temperament. Lately, he's been using AF4. <br><br>I often wonder if switching systems is a form of procrastination or a healthy approach to keeping things fresh. Thoughts anyone?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 January 2010 at 13:17 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well, in my case, switching systems used to be a form of procrastination. But I also get a kind of motivation from a new, shiny, empty notebook waiting to be filled with exiting tasks. Kind of feeling on top of everything because everything isn't defined until you start writing out the tasks :-).<br><br>With AF4, the occassional rewriting of tasks at dismissal or when starting a new notebook is enough to satisfy that feeling, so I'm not really tempted to switch systems.

So far this is a real achievement as previously I had them all over the place.  Also it has stimulated ideas as the how to improve other things - for example setting up daily/weekly/monthly rituals or habits.<br><br>As I haven't actually read DIT I decided I should, so I have ordered it from Amazon and am eagerly awaiting it's arrival.  This will put me in a good position should I decide to use DIT2 when it is 'unveiled' although I get the impression DIT2 is really a series of tweaks to the original DIT to make it even better (hence buying the book).  I also believe that for the price of the book (I paid under £6 for it new) - even if I get only one or two really good ideas to make life easier it will be worth it!!  Also it is a way of contributing to Mark's excellent ideas - hopefully he gets royality on each book sold.<br><br>I have a very tasty Filofax cherry red leather A filofax which is very underutilised.  I also have a page a day diary for this filofax, so if it is suitable I think I'll probably plan to use that if I decide on DIT2.<br><br>Can't wait to read the book. and read DIT2.

Also, it's quite easy to refer to when a task was done. <br><br>I had a lot of success with the diary below for DIT well over a year. The picture though shows the weekly format for some reason. Wether it will work for DIT 2 I am not sure yet. <br><br>Mark, are you able to comment before I rush out right now and buy one ?!  <br><br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Collins-Classic-Appointments-Half-Hourly-W190xH260mm/dp/B0029YBCB6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=officeproduct&amp;qid=1264682475&amp;sr=1-4">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Collins-Classic-Appointments-Half-Hourly-W190xH260mm/dp/B0029YBCB6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=officeproduct&amp;qid=1264682475&amp;sr=1-4</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2010 at 12:51 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison R:<br><br>True, the 'large' moleskine is more like A5. But whether you really need A4 is another question. I have the impression Mark likes to have much room. IIRC he used A4 for AF too. I for example used A7 for AF, and Mark said we need a larger notebook for DIT2 because we need two columns. So I think I will be fine with A5. But then again my handwriting is rather small, so it may not be for everyone.<br><br>Another thing is that the moleskine is the only product mentioned so far that I can get off amazon.de instead of importing from US or UK. But I'm still looking. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2010 at 13:50 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon and Andreas:<br><br>There's no doubt that DIT2, as I'm testing it at present, uses quite considerably more space than DIT. For example yesterday was a fairly typical day for me. The page for that day needed room for 121 tasks.<br><br>Most people probably won't use DIT2 for *everything* in the way that I am at the moment. If you consider what proportion of your waking day you are likely to use it for, then you can arrive at an approximate figure for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 January 2010 at 14:18 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seems to me that the sensible thing to do is to wait until Mark is ready to share, and then we can all make up our minds on the best format for our needs.
