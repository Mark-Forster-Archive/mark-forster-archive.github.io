With apologies to Mark and the Nintendo company, I named it Autofocus Advance. <br><br>Rules <br><br>Each AF page is divided into two areas (such as by a dividing line about half way down the page, using two columns, or using facing pages.) The first is the new task area, the second is the reentered task area. <br><br>Rules for cycling through the pages, task selection, and dismissal are as in Autofocus 1. The two areas are treated as if they formed a single, contiguous page. Free space in the reentered task area doesn't keep from finishing or dismissing pages. <br><br>New tasks are entered in the new task area on the last page of the list. A new page is started when the last page's new task area is full. <br><br>Reentered tasks are entered in the reentered task area of the NEXT page, i.e., the page that you'll work on right after you leave the current one. If that area is full, put the task wherever you like, except that you never write on the current page unless it is also the last page. If you can't find a space, add it as a new task instead. <br><br>Experience <br><br>The flow of Autofocus Advance is clearly different from Autofocus 1. It is easier to cycle through the list. Your ongoing projects can advance through the list along with you. They don't cluster at the end. Instead of keeping you attached to the end of the list, they help you advance to the next page. <br><br>At the same time key properties of Autofocus 1 are preserved. There still is the intuitive selection process focusing on a single page at a time. There is now an open area on most pages, yet pages (other than the last one) still behave as closed lists while being actively worked on. <br><br>Future Work <br><br>The relative sizes of the two areas may be able to fine-tune properties of the system. So far I've always used an equal 50/50 split. <br><br>Anticipated FAQ <br><br>Q: Isn't this more like SuperFocus than Autofocus? <br><br>A: It takes a bit of geekery to see why, but it is actually important in Autofocus Advance that you don't reenter a task back on the current page. The defining twist of SuperFocus is that you can do just that! So the two systems are mutually exclusive twists on the common Autfocus theme.<br><br>Q: May I enter a really urgent task on the current page? <br><br>A: A rule tweak that would occasionally allow urgent new tasks (not reentered tasks) onto the current page is possible--in theory--without breaking the system. So far I haven't used such a tweak.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2011 at 14:55 | Marcus</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Marcus:<br><br>Well done! Writing re-entered tasks in Column 2 of the next page is one of the new rules included in SuperFocus v. 3.

What effect does that have in practice?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2011 at 15:09 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To revise and extend my previous post, if you did end up working on all four pages you'd be getting a lot of stuff done besides the project(s) from the first page. In the meantime you would have been working often on a project so it would either get done or make steady progress. If you also allowed urgent matters in the second column you would not have to put them off to the last page. Call it SuperFocus Advance. :) Oh I guess you did mention that possible tweak in the last question, about possibly entering urgent items on the current page. I think it might also be treated by the "common sense" rule: if something is urgent, just do it!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2011 at 16:16 | Don R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark: Thank you!<br><br>Don: The last page has a reentered task area, too. Under extreme circumstances, with 5 pages, you could even work on the same project for 8 consecutive page turns, or 15. But you would have done the AF selection procedure on each page. Since you trust your intuition to do a good ranking of the tasks on each page, the conclusion from ever having done a thing like this would be that your intuition found this project really more worthy of working on than every other thing on the list--much more so than you yourself suspected when you stopped working on it over and over again:-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2011 at 16:31 | Marcus</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;Q: May I enter a really urgent task on the current page? &gt;<br><br>How about entering urgent tasks on the *next* page (if not urgent enough to do right now with the 'common sense rule' ;-) )<br><br>Also how about entering some tasks *beyond* the last page?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2011 at 16:58 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>smileypete:<br><br>&lt;&lt; How about entering urgent tasks on the *next* page &gt;&gt;<br><br>I tried this as part of the development of SuperFocus v. 3 and it doesn't  work!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2011 at 18:02 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting concept, Marcus! Made even more so by Mark's acknowledgement that it shares rules with SFv3.<br><br>No distinction is being made between recurring and unfinished tasks, right?

And it sounds as if there are some very good similarities to Mark's SF3.  This is a modification that I am going to implement and try!  It will be intriguing to see how similar indeed your system is to the pending SuperFocus 3.   :)<br><br>-David</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2011 at 18:38 | David Drake</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I eliminated the two areas. The resulting ruleset is even simpler and items are always contiguous on a page. The balance between new tasks and reentered tasks on a page is slightly shifted. I compensated by including the urgent task tweak into the ruleset. If you feel that the balance is off (whether using the original ruleset or this one), you can experiment by slightly shifting the barrier position on new pages.<br><br>The Rules<br><br>Arrange for each page to have a visible barrier about halfway into the page. You could draw a line, or use the natural jump between two columns or facing pages. <br><br>Rules for cycling through the pages, task selection, and dismissal are as in AF1. Free space behind the barrier doesn't keep from finishing or dismissing pages. <br><br>New tasks are normally entered on the youngest page of the list. If the new entry would go behind the barrier, a new page is started instead. Exceptionally urgent tasks may be entered on the current page. <br><br>Reentered tasks are entered on the NEXT page, i.e., the page that you'll work on right after you leave the current one. If that page is full, put the task on any other page you like, except for the current page. If you can't find such a place, add it as a non-urgent new task.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 February 2011 at 21:30 | Marcus</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Marcus - thank you for sharing this gem. Would recurring tasks have the same treatment in your opinion ie entered on the 2nd column of the next page? This would ensure they are touched on frequently so that one is on top of regular tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 3:13 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is a system that I think will flow well for me - I'm going to give it a try starting tomorrow.  Adding to the end of my current list right now so I can get to it first.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 7:44 | wairererose</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Regarding unfinished tasks vs. recurring tasks:<br><br>IF you re-enter recurring tasks on the next page and a) you only (need to) do these recurring tasks once a week and b) you add about half a page of new tasks every day, THEN...<br><br>... eventually your recurring tasks will cluster at the beginning, holding up the dismissal process of those pages. You can see this by realizing that you are adding one page every two days, whereas those weekly recurring tasks are only moving forward one page every week.<br><br>Thus, I think I can pretty much conclude that you should only re-enter on the next page 1) unfinished tasks and 2) daily tasks, while you re-enter less frequently recurring tasks at the end. The re-enter on the next page rule encourages tasks to be worked on every day or two days (assuming you add a new page of tasks every day or two days), since dismissal looms over them if you don't.<br><br>@Marcus: can you comment on this? Since you have actually *used* the system, whereas I'm just hypothesizing :).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 8:35 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Surely the *only* reason to consider the next page is so you can get back to the task real soon. This only applies to things you started but didn't finish.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 12:17 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I don't use my AF system as either a clock, timer or calendar. I'd find it unreliable as a timer or clock and clumsy as a calendar. <br><br>I feed the system with new tasks sourcing from the calendar and from weekly/monthly checklists. That covers recurring tasks that run weekly or more infrequently. What few daily recurring tasks I have, I run off a small morning checklist. They only go into the system if I don't do them right away, which isn't often. <br><br>Over time I've found that wherever I keep track of the current day's scheduled timeline (maybe a calendar page, maybe a scrap of paper) is a good place to keep track of urgent same-day tasks. That's because urgency usually implies deadlines and time commitments. <br><br>Items on my AF list therefore tend have two properties related to time: They are ready to be worked on now but don't have a deadline today. It's not an iron rule, but is usually true. <br><br>Again, all of this is because --personally-- I don't think of the Autofocus systems as timing devices. <br><br>That leaves some kinds recurring tasks that may alternatively be viewed as neverending tasks/projects, such as answering your e-mail. Yes, I treat these like other re-entered tasks, i.e., put them on the next page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 12:34 | Marcus</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>As Marcus's new system bears a lot of resemblance to SuperFocus v. 3 which I've been testing, I think I am going to bring the testing to an end and publish the amendment now, rather than wait until I finish "War and Peace" - which was the original plan.<br><br>So just as soon as I can write the instructions I will publish them on my blog.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 14:20 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh great, now I'll be anxiously hitting "reload" on your blog page all morning.

In my defense Marcus' original rules did not distinguish recurring from unfinished tasks since they can both be seen as being 're-entered' ;).<br><br>Thanks for posting the new rules, Mark!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 February 2011 at 16:21 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, very interesting new system! <br><br>I spent some time yesterday digesting it. I now regret not having used the alternative formulation ("barrier" instead of "areas") already when I first posted Autofocus Advance. <br><br>Apart from the fact that I just like the second way better, I suspect the first wording may have also made you think of Autofocus Advance as more similar to SFv3 than it may turn out to be. <br><br>AF Advance is original Autofocus with a ruleset tweak designed to reduce resistance within the system. It is not a move away or beyond autofocus.<br><br>SFv3 is more than a tweak of AF1; it is essentially a sandwich of two parallel systems. You run a (surprisingly un-tweaked) AF 1 in the first column of each page. You use space in the second columns to run a second and much simpler system --let's call it Column 2 System, C2S. You run the systems in lockstep. AF1 feeds tasks into C2S. C2S gates progress in AF1. You could actually pull C2S out of your notebook, put it on a whiteboard, and get a mostly equivalent composite system. <br><br>The important difference regarding those similar looking rules is that in AF Advance, they tweak AF1. In SFv3, these rules do not live in the AF1 part of the sandwich, but are part of the way the C2S operates in the second columns. This makes me suspect the similarity will turn out to be somewhat smaller than the similarity in wording lead us to expect at first.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2011 at 9:12 | Marcus</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Marcus:<br><br>I'm not sure I entirely follow what you are saying here, especially the bit about my column 2 being a mostly equivalent composite system.<br><br>As far as I can see the only differences in the ordinary working of your system and my system are:<br><br>- You re-enter all tasks on the next page, while I re-enter only unfinished tasks on the next page.<br><br>- You do not have to clear all tasks in column 2 before moving on, while I do have to clear them.<br><br>There are other differences in detail, especially in the rules for dismissal, but they are incidental.<br><br>My main worry with your system is that I usually have considerably more recurring tasks than new tasks, and I'm not sure how that would work out in practice. Even if one adjusted the position of the barrier to allow for this, wouldn't it just result in new stuff hanging around for much longer before being actioned?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 February 2011 at 9:43 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark: It helped me understand SFv3 (which is new to me) to re-frame it as a "composite system" built out of one part original AF1 (which I know) and one part dynamic round robin scheduler (which I know) working in lockstep with the first feeding tasks into the second.<br><br>Since --in this re-framing-- the re-entry rule operates within the second part, which is quite unlike AF1, I concluded that from the very similar wording we need not expect very similar behaviour.<br><br>Regarding new stuff hanging around longer: yes, compared to me very much clinging to the end of the list in AF1, I tend to spend more time "away" on other pages. It works for me because "do it tomorrow" usually works for me.
