In fact I’m a keen user of all systems developed by Mark Forster.<br><br>My reason for this post is to ask all lurkers and regular posts to take a step back and have a reality check.<br><br>Since the launch of DWM some of the comments and the tone of those comments are giving me some concern, Is everyone remembering what we have here? Essentially we have 1 – 2 – 1 (free) coaching with to me, one of the best if not the best time management gurus around.<br><br>Mark is definitely up there with David Allen, Stephen Covey and David Taylor and in my opinion he is beyond them because<br><br>a)	he is not stuck in one system or rigid in his beliefs<br>b)	he accepts he is not right all the time<br>c)	he is not trying to sell me an organiser, a pen or bizarrely on one web site essential oils!<br><br>He has given us one of the simplest T.M. Systems with AF, free of charge and all you need is a cheap notepad and pen – you can add all you like in terms of moleskine books,  computer programs etc but all you really need is a cheap notepad and pen.<br><br>He has asked that people test it so AF became AF2, AF3 and AF4. All free of charge, all open to constructive criticism and always being developed.<br><br>I came to Mark’s website after reading all 3 of his books. DIT is commonly mentioned in posts but I find it does not work as a system for me although I take from it 3 things<br><br>a)	building in a buffer so as not to interfere with what I am doing today<br>b)	using checklists where appropriate (I want to be Mick Cool and not Joe Slobb!) and<br>c)	the current initiative principle<br><br>In my opinion the better system is detailed in Mark’s first book ‘Get Everything Done’ with the principle of regular, focussed, sufficient attention and I see more of this principle in all versions of the AF system then I do DIT.<br><br>In fact AF is to me GED’s regular, focused, sufficient attention developed to make sure you capture everything. I think that’s why David Allen’s GTD is often quoted in AF posts.<br><br>(His second book does not relate to time management and is not really relevant here but it’s a fantastic revolutionary way of looking at your life but its not for this post.)<br><br>I have been using AF1 since it started, failed very quickly with AF2 and AF3, settled for a while in AF4 and have just recently went back to a variation of AF1. What suits me for a typical day best is<br><br>a)	30 minutes on current initiative from DIT (if required)<br>b)	30 minutes on routine tasks in the office<br>c)	AF1 (or 4) with no more than 15 minutes on any activity before moving onto next item (from GED).<br><br>I mention this to demonstrate that I use a bit of every system Mark has developed. I am grateful for all of the work he has put into developing those systems, ongoing changes and continually trying to create a better system.<br><br>I am however concerned about some of the language and tone of comments since the launch of DIT2/AF2 (now DWM) will make Mark stop continually trying out new ideas and systems on us. Let’s be honest Mark must enjoy doing this as he’s not making any money out of it or us, but how long will it last?<br><br>A quick scan of the comments comes up with “this whole thing has become a joke”, “not impressed Mark”, “completely bewildered” and “sheer madness”. Mark responds to those comments gracefully but again for how much longer?<br><br>So that’s my input (back to lurking again!) On reading the posts since the launch of the new system (which again costs next to nothing – an A4 diary!) I think the emotions have been running a bit high but we should all take stock of what we have here – the most down to earth, non dogmatic TM expert asking us to try out a system he has only been pre testing himself for 3 days and giving us back virtually real time feedback and advice. Can anyone think of another T.M. expert that would put himself out there like that?<br><br>Regards</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 9:13 | Skeg</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Right on, Skeg!<br><br>While there always have been nay-sayers with every new system Mark invented, they seems to be somewhat louder this time. I can only ask to do what what Mark asked of them, that is trying the system out before bashing it. I'll use it for a month or two before voicing criticism (if at all). I'll even use the name DWM from now on. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 9:29 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Skeg:<br><br>&lt;&lt; ... asking us to try out a system he has only been pre testing himself for 3 days and giving us back virtually real time feedback and advice. Can anyone think of another T.M. expert that would put himself out there like that? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Or whose time management system would be capable of coping with the demand? :-)<br><br>Thanks for your support (and Andreas too).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 9:34 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well said Skeg - I agree with you completely.  I am currently reading Mark's books and am beyond impressed - he really seems to speak to me personally. I am getting a lot out of them, and have been lucky enough to pick up a copy of his dreams book for a resonable amount which I am waiting to be delivered.<br><br>There is no excuse for rudeness or bluntness in any situation (being graceful is, in my opinion, one thing we should all aspire to). I can understand feelings running high if people had invested significant hard earned cash (which many TM guru's expect) but to do it when the advice and help is offered free is really rude.<br><br>As you say, in it's simplest form, none of Mark's advice is based on expensive technology. How complex or techy we want to make it is up to us.<br><br>I suspect that we all get something from each system, and tweak to suit our circumstance, so in the end we end up with something very peresonal that works for US.<br><br>Three cheers for Mark!!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 9:48 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>..from another lurker..well said, and thanks to Mark for all, including his patience.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 10:06 | Jiru</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi all - I agree with Skeg.  It brings to mind two analogies.<br><br>First, road-rage: a driver sitting cocooned in a car, who thinks another driver has done something wrong, may interact with that driver in a very different way than if he/she were standing face-to-face with them.  In a similar way, some people posting on a forum say things they would never dream of saying if they were face-to-face with someone having a conversation - being "invisible" can lure people away from the niceties which make up good manners. <br><br>Second, imagine that you are keen to learn to play tennis, and a top-notch tennis coach has offered to teach you every single day for 1 month, free of charge, with all the back-up you need.  On your first session the coach explains the basic techniques you need to learn to become a good player and asks you to practice them every day.  For a couple of days you do exactly as he says, but then on the third day you start thinking maybe his techniques could be improved, or are plain wrong, and you decide you'll make a few tweaks here and there, maybe use a badminton racquet instead to see if that's any better, maybe change the scoring system so that you only need a score of 30 to win a game.   How do you think that's going to work out for you in your bid to become a good tennis player?<br><br>So how about getting behind Mark in this enterprise: how about testing the system as it stands, taking into account any amendments he himself suggests, for a reasonable period of time, so that the feedback he gets is useful.  It is quite likely that a (mainly silent) majority of people on the forum are already doing just that, and reserving judgement until they've worked DWM for long enough to see its advantages or disadvantages.   It goes against some people's nature to blindly follow instructions from another person without continually questioning the method every step of the way, and no doubt there will be some useful ideas that Mark can take from their comments, as well as from the comments of those who are testing the system as Mark launched it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 11:11 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Quite right Skeg.  Mark is as ever being incredibly generous with his time and expertise and setting us a great example - in many other things as well as in relation to the system.  It's amazing to have a resource like this on which he is available to respond to issues arising!  <br><br>After all, he's not forcing anyone to try out these systems ...<br><br>Personally I am also trialling DWM just as Mark has set it out, benefiting from the further explanation he has provided and checking for any updates he recommends.  I do hope to be able to provide feedback in due course but I do not think I'll be ready to do so for at least six weeks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 12:13 | Elizabeth</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hear, hear!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 12:36 | JMTee</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I haven' t read the comments referred to yet (AF4 is still keeping me busy!), but I want to add that the users also deserve a pat on their backs (and Mark especially for using the internet in this way).<br><br>Imagine the alternative - AF1 distributed through a published book, with no fluid testing online. There would not have been AF2/3/4 or DWM. So kudos to all who have partaken in this enterprise so far with their constructive suggestions and feedback, and especially to Mark Forster for having the courage to facilitate it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 12:44 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thank you Skeg for this thread.

Hopefully I haven't made any comment that was taken as rude.  If I did, I hope everyone and especially Mark will accept my apology.  <br><br>There really is no excuse for rude comments.  If someone doesn't think DWM will work for him or her, they can just stick with what does.  No rude comment needed.<br><br>Questions are fine, if polite.  A comment that a particular aspect doesn't seem like it will work or that they don't understand the reasoning behind it is probably OK as well (if polite).<br><br>Lets all be nice.  We all are benefiting from Mark's love of what he does and sharing it with us.<br><br>Thank you .</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 13:49 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In case it's not understood, I agree.  Closed lists, AutoFocus, and now DWM are great ideas.  I think especially DWM.  The initial presentation confused a lot of people, myself included, but the rules really do add up to a system that seems to work  very well, and Mark's continued feedback is extremely welcome.<br><br>Thanks!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 13:54 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>All agreed.<br><br>But actually, if I were Mark, I'd be tempted to be flattered by the number of comments along the lines of 'What!! That'll never work!' - at least they're confirmation of a pretty revolutionary system. (I seem to remember a lot of similar comments on the original AF - not so much on the others as they were more evolutionary)<br><br>On the other hand, they could be right! Time (and my boss) will tell...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 14:07 | Ed C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>From another lurker - thanks Mark for making your ideas so freely available.  AF didn't work for me, but I use many of the ideas from DIT and GED.  It's great to have someone who is still developing new ideas and is happy to put them out there for us to try out, and if they work for us, to benefit from.  Thanks Mark!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 15:22 | Ben H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Skeg is right, of course. <br>But I think one reason for the highly emotional content of some of these comments is that people take Mark's work very seriously. They put their faith in his ideas.  More important, in trying out Mark's ideas  they  are willing to experiment with their most precious commodity -- their time. The "tennis coach" analogy only goes so far.  If your tennis coach is not effective, all that suffers is your tennis game. But if a time-management system doesn't work, your whole life can be tilted off its axis.  <br>So if emotions run high on this message board once in awhile, it doesn't surprise me.  The stake are high, for Mark, but for us as well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 15:29 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I am another "lurker" that agrees with Skeg.  I often find an inspirational nugget or two when I check on the latest exchange between Mark and the active contributors, especially when they are tinkering with a new system.  The constant tinkering is what prevents this forum from becoming stale.   <br><br>The tinkering also proves, as the skeptics correctly point out, that none of the TM systems developed to this point (DIT, AFx.xx) have been perfect for everyone, but then, most of us never thought the systems were perfect.  Imperfect people don't need perfect systems to improve their productivity.   A quick look at my colleagues' and friends' desks confirms that any one of these imperfect systems is better than disorganized chaos.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 16:10 | B.G.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I too agree.  Most of the time management gurus would be charging for things like updates to systems, DVDs of interviews and even have paid forums where you may or may not have access to the author.  Remember Mark invited us to help test the system.  There is absolutely no obligation to do so.  People can sit back and wait for the final version, or use one of the other methods many of which are free, which are supported as well. <br><br>Gerry<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2010 at 16:11 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If there are any viewers of the US television show, "The Big Bang Theory," you may recognize the similarities between some of the reponses to DWM and a repeated theme on Big Bang: a simple idea (by Penny, e.g.) is immediately pounced on, weighted down, made enormously complicated and unworkable by the good-intentioned but impractical ideas of Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Rajesh.<br><br>As a designer, I completely understand this impulse.
