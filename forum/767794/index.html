There are all kinds of things to do before the trip.  Researching the destination.  Getting the seeds going so they can grow while I'm away.  Making list of stuff husband has to do while I'm away.<br><br>I've been trying to manage that stuff (plus all my other stuff) with AutoFocus.  I have a fair amount of discretionary time each day, and I get a lot of new ideas to add to my list every day.  Right now I have 28 open pages (and 20 completed pages since January 5th).  After a couple of months of keeping track, I find I make it through about 6 pages each day.<br><br>I'm getting tons done, especially stuff that has been hanging around forever.  I've also dismissed a lot of stuff, especially stuff that has been hanging around forever.  But as my trip grows closer, I'm stressed that I won't get to everything -- or even see everything.<br><br>I know this topic has been covered many times before.  Little &amp; Often vs. As Much As You Want.  But I'm still not getting it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 May 2009 at 6:56 | slothbear</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sounds like a deadline problem.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/622052#post622972">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/622052#post622972</a><br><br>Do you have a clear idea of what being ready will look and feel like?<br><br>You might want to make this a current initiative. That is, Something you spend at least a few minutes on each day before even opening your lists until you are comfortable that it will get done in time. (You can only have one!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 May 2009 at 8:42 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It comes down to two answers:<br><br>- Use AF as written for it and trust that your intuition will manage it or,<br><br>- Keep a separate "Things to do before my trip" list.<br><br>I opt for the latter with reminders on my calendar.  You could also put reminders in your AF list as well.  Personally, I find that trip things (unless you travel very frequently and are set up to travel) are out of the ordinary ... or maybe that is wrong ... they are so IN the ordinary that you scarcely think about them.  I suspect that is why they tend to get overlooked.  Why you wind up in Timbuktu without a toothbrush, for example.  Anyway, I find that thinking through my daily activities helps me generate a list of things to consider for my trip and writing those on a list is helpful.<br><br>Now, to put this in context, I am just a tad paranoid about this.  Some years ago, I drove to another city for a business meeting.  I packed up and was ready to go early.  (I traveled frequently so I had this all down at, you have to understand.)  Just a few miles outside of my destination I was reviewing my next To Dos.<br><br>- Get to the City<br>- Find the hotel<br>- Unpack<br>- Change into my business suit ... OH CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>I realized at that moment that I had left my suit hanging on the hall tree to be put in the car and never took it out and PUT IT IN THE CAR!  Trust me, this was my many hundredth trip and I was no amateur at this whole business ... something just distracted me that day and ... well ... it was not a fun time.<br><br>So factor my paranoia into this whole business before you decide ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 May 2009 at 12:04 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Generally I will treat trip planning as a project or mini project. I used to do a lot of business travel and maintained a "Travel" file which contained a lot of reusable information - eg City Maps, specific info about hotels, packing lists (depending upon locations and time of year!) Client Contact Details etc.  As most of my travel was in the US I kept a bag of US related travel items ready to go, including such things as plug adapters, US hairdryer, US stamps, travel stationery supplies etc. Basically, anything that could be prepared in advance was done so.<br><br>I also had a general check list (eg passport, tickets, company literature, set video etc) and then only needed to prepare a checklist for anything unique to the current trip.<br><br>Even though I do not travel so frequently I still have packing lists and an overnight bag packed and available so that I can literally go somewhere immediately in the case of an emergency - or perhaps when I've just had enough of my backlog - now there's an idea ....:-)<br><br>I think a checklist of things to do/action is vital for any trip but this can easily be prepared and actioned as part of a general "trip planning" task within AF.  By the time the trip gets closer then most things will be prepared, with just a final checklist for day of departure tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 May 2009 at 13:48 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>slothbear, I colour with a highlighter a small box on the left margin of tasks that are related in some way (eg. those on my home book that I can do at work, those I intend to delegate to my son to do).   You could differentiate those tasks relating to your trip on your list in this way?  Or just put a "T" for trip beside them?  <br><br>I know how you feel - I think there's a reason why there's that old phrase "some people plan their two week vacation more than their lives" - it's partly because trips take a lot of time to plan properly.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2009 at 16:48 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for all the thoughts.  <br><br>Jacqueline, I like the idea of adding another level of standout-ness to the trip items.  I already do that for items with deadlines (that don't really fit in my calendar, like writing a Thank You note promptly).  I put the date on the line and highlight it.  Once a day I go through all pages looking for highlighted dates.  If it's due today, I either do the item or dismiss it.  Hmmm, almost AF within AF.<br><br>That might work well for trip planning -- or any other kind of concerted planning.  Treating the whole thing as a separate project makes sense, except it never works for me.  I always feel like it's too much work, or I have plenty of time, or some other excuse to procrastinate.<br><br>I'm sure it would drive some people doolally to have their trip prep items interspersed with other items on a dozen pages -- but I can see it (like all of AF) working for me if I can quell the stress with a hack like highlighting.  (Unless the New System handles it even better, hint.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2009 at 22:23 | slothbear</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oh, and I'm on the other side of the country now, having used a combo of AF and some project lists.  Too much stress, but I made it.  The only things I forgot were q-tips, and to eat breakfast before I left.  Counts as a success -- but I'd like to do it better next time, so I decided to ask for help here.  I'll let you know how it goes next trip, whether I use A(AF)F or some other technique.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2009 at 22:27 | slothbear</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find it helps to keep a small journal called: "Lessons Learned".  In this case, write what you forgot for this trip and put it on your trip list so you'll not forget next time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2009 at 22:29 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My tuppenceworth...  another option would be to scan AF every week for items to be done next week and then schedule them in next week's calendar, that way you keep an eye on upcoming deadline issues - remember to remove these items from AF once you have scheduled them.<br><br>Enjoy your trip,<br><br>Derek</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 May 2009 at 5:36 | Derek D</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yet another interesting post.  Checklists are essential for me and I am finding I can integrate them with AF.<br><br>I travel abroad from the UK for 95% of my work, some assignments are in developing or recovering regions, so I use checklists a lot.  This is so I can always have the right kit, supplies, spares with me to carry out my work, even if the baggage handlers manage to send my checked luggage somewhere else.<br><br>Like Christine, but not as much as her, I use OneNote and am moving some backlog and project stuff out of my AF book (Moleskine, medium size, hard cover, one end for work, other end flipped over for personal), but I still jot down checklists and items that may have be considered for checklists in my AF notebook.<br><br>This is because I only use the right page for AF entries and processing.  The left-hand pages are used for important information, even notes on key meetings, IP settings for Internet access abroad and checklists.<br><br>So for my next assignment (Egypt next month for the month), I have a travel checklist on a left-hand page already set up and being amended as necessary.  By processing this list, I can add outstanding items to the end of my AF list, eg get repeat medication to last the duration, replace Energizer USB recharger.  My travel checklists have sections: travel/wear en route, cabin bag, and checkin case (hardshell to minimise damage and theft).<br><br>Thanks to this forum, I have picked up all sorts of useful tips, and because I seemed not be making progress at one point, I realised I had transgressed by entering too many backlogs and other "baggage" in my AF list at the start.<br><br>This has made me move such items out to OneNote along with projects/major tasks, BUT I list current project titles on a left-hand page.  So I can do what others on this forum have advocated: put the next action (or more, if appropriate) for a project on my AF list (steps and next actions/tasks are listed in OneNote) for AF processing.<br><br>Similarly, I have crossed out backlog items from early/old pages and written them on a separate left-hand page from where they can be transferred one or more at a time and placed (again!) on the AF list like any other.<br><br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 May 2009 at 17:35 | Roger J</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
