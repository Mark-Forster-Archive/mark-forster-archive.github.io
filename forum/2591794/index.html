I have kept a catch-all list, Autofocus-type list, free form notebook, and kept my notes and ideas, and day schedule in it.  But I have several years of notebooks that I don't look at again, but don't want to throw away either in case there is something valuable in them. They are beginning to accumulate.  The notebook method works the best each time I start a new notebook.  However, after a month the method begins to slow down, but at least the notebook keeps all I have written in one place, it might take several minutes to find something, but at least I know it's there.  It bogs down about 3 months, or I run out of space, and I get a new notebook.  The one advantage of a free form notebook is that you just keep writing, it is easy to capture thoughts, and it keeps the pages in chronological order. <br>It works well with an Autofocus list, or catch-all list. <br><br>For the last few days, I have been experimenting using a clipboard, and clipboard with a box/case.  The case can hold a few papers, but will reach a limit, which encourages weeding.  I could keep a daily checklist, and today's tasks, and keep notes, and try to weed the previous day papers after a 4 day limit, like DIT,and store any papers in a 3 ring binder.  I have thought about having a different clipboard for each activity/job that I have. <br>The clipboard might work out better if I want to try any of the no-list methods.  I can keep a pocket calendar in the box. <br><br>On the no-list methods - I work at several places at several jobs, I am a musician, and at 60 years old, I find I am forgetting more things now, and I need to write down my committments, because I don't know that I would remember without a list or calendar.  However, I could use a catch-all list to feed the no-list.  <br><br>I have tried index cards, but I don't like it that I can only see one side, I can't tell if it is blank or not, the index cards accumulate faster than loose leaf paper, and not hold together like a notebook, and would demand constant organizing.  For me, an index card would only work out if there one item on it, like a current initiative, or a project that gets carried over from one day to the next, or the most important task for the day, and then gets thrown away<br><br>Any thoughts?  Does anyone have a system using a clipboard?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2016 at 14:55 | mark h.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Of the methods you describe I have tried notebook and index cards.  Index cards was not good and I abandoned it after a very short time.  They became a mess and unruly very quickly.<br><br>Regarding a notebook, I found the best thing was a simple running list where you list all tasks one per line and don't mix in notes.  Over the years I found notes mixes with to-dos get quickly out of hand.  You end up with notes you no longer need mixed in with tasks and it becomes too many pages to flip through.<br><br>I was going to experiment with a spiral notebook which allows you to add and also subtract.  So add tasks and notes if you must but remove and file or toss notes and reduce pages as things get done.  <br><br>I am realizing keeping a clean desk and reducing commitments and clutter is also a time saver and helps improve productivity.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2016 at 23:57 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>mark h.: When I used a notebook/daily planner, I kept an index in the back of all significant info. I'd just put the date and then "login info for new system" or "procedure for XYZ." Usually, for little bits and bobs of info, I'd dedicate the last 10 pages or so to just those little squibs of information.<br><br>A contractor's clipboard is a nice container for loose papers and such. Since you move around to so many different jobs, coming up with a low-level system (or set of systems) would be the first step, probably. I guess that might start with defining what do you specifically need to have on hand for each job, do you use the same calendar to track all your jobs and how easily accessible is it, and so on. <br><br>I'd think through a use case where you have to leave one job in a hurry and then arrive at the next one with no time to spare. What would you need on hand (either paper or digitally) to wrap up the first job so you could step back into it the next day with no interruption? What would you need on hand to start the second job without needing 5 minutes to pull yourself together and settle down?<br><br>Writing this down as if it were a story could help you mentally walk through the various trapdoors that aren't obvious right now. Once you've thought through the physics, as it were, of the situation (state of mind, what's needed at each job, physical and time constraints), then you can focus on the engineering (whether to use a notebook, clipboard, etc).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 April 2016 at 15:55 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I use a clipboard.  Well sort off. <br><br> I really like having my current page always on top and used an actual clipboard for a few days before discovering that it wasn't great for keeping the pages uncrumpled or unsoiled when in transit.  I don't like the clipboard boxes because they feel  too big  and clunky so I made my own.<br><br>Here is how I did it. I have a *very* sturdy spiral bound notebook that I ripped all of the pages out of resulting in an empty notebook.  I then put fresh lined paper or printouts in the notebook and simply clip them to the back flap of the notebook with a small binder clip.  Now I can flip the top cover back while working the list on top and flip the cover back over the papers when I'm in transit. It's the best of both worlds.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 April 2016 at 20:15 | Brent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Brent <br>Interesting.

There were enough loose pages that I decided to put them in a three ring binder portfolio and put the clipboard in the back of the portfolio. The advantage of a notebook is it keeps the pages together and not falling out and keeps them in chronological order. However the pages cannot be taken out and after a month or two or three a notebook becomes difficult to sort through. I am hoping that I'll be able to sift through the pages and throw out the ones that I no longer need. The clipboard comes in handy if I only need <br>to write one page.

I'm keeping a lot more notes these days. The Bullet Journal system wasn't keeping them organized well enough. Now I have one section for the active page of each of my daily logs (health, housework, pets, summary of routines accomplished), and another section for the finished pages. When logging each day, I just go through each page in the active section.<br><br>They day's run sheet is clipped to the front. (Planned events, rocks, 5T, catch-all)<br><br>I was going to use a fauxdori system. Several thin notebooks in one cover. One notebook per project. Can design forms and make the notebooks myself. Easy to change books in and out, depending on the day. Size that I chose rather than what store sells. (1/2 page, which would also fit handouts nicely.) Then I found the hole punch for 1/2-size paper before I found the sewing awl I planned to use for making the little books. Big decisions are often made in strange ways.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 April 2016 at 5:25 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Dad keeps notebooks. It's a hold-over from his engineering training, when the log book was a legal record for patents. Everything in one book. He leaves the information in the book.<br><br>When I used a notebook, I would tear out the pages at the end and file them.<br><br>Last month, though, I had too many open pages. A tiny note each day for several different projects. (I'm on a "you need to measure what you want to improve" kick.) Each topic on its own page so I could see trends. Several book darts so I could find each one easily during my daily review.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 April 2016 at 5:29 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The idea of using a clipboard to manage my time is not working out.  There are too many loose pages that are not sorted.  <br><br>The clipboard is good for a to-do list for one day, or a list on the go. <br><br>I think I will go back to a notebook for writing.  That way they are held together in chronological order.  Perhaps I will use the clipboard for what I am currently working on.  It is easier to find than finding the page in the notebook.  Perhaps I will use a catch-all list in the notebook. <br><br>Mark H.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 May 2016 at 16:58 | mark h.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@mark h<br><br>Admittedly this is an experiment for me as well but I've stuck with it for a month or more now and I still like it better than what I was doing with the notebook.  <br><br>I'm definitely not trying to convince you otherwise, but I'm curious to how many pages  become "too many loose pages"   I've found that I don't like it when it exceeds 15 total pages (I just counted and I'm at 12 after a month)  and I'd prefer to keep it less than 10 total pages.  <br><br>I've been purging, consolidating, or archiving pages at least once a week during a review process to keep the page count down.   I usually have a new page a day so without purging I'd be well over 30.<br><br>For consolidating  I find the act of re-writing  items that remain on  a page of otherwise mostly checked off or crossed of items onto a new page is a good time to either refresh the commitment or decide not to re-write it and effectively delete the task.<br><br>This writing and sifting process tends to sift things to the bottom. Meaning: I have a few pages  left over that are effectively full of old tasks that haven't anything crossed off.  They are either  low priority  or something I'm resisting. It's kind of a someday/maybe list<br><br>For the resisted items, this site is full of ideas on how to tackle getting over that.  :)   But I do best when I pick one of them cross it of the someday/maybe list   and write it on the fresh new top page and give it another go.<br><br>Brent</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 May 2016 at 21:29 | Brent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Brent.

A 5 by 8 bound notebook is so portable, keeps all the papers together,  in chronological order, I can hold it in one hand, and take walks with it.  I have used 3 x 5 notebooks and they are portable.  A clipboard is good for one page that is used constantly. It might be good for a today to do list. If i limit it to one page, and trash the previous page, it might be manageable.  But I am used to keep a running list, and writing in notes, and I would rather only one carry one object, so a notebook wins out.  I have kept my daily routine items on a clipboard, which works pretty well. This I do at home, so I don't have to carry it around.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2016 at 17:15 | Mark H.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Personally I use a notebook when I'm using a "catch-all" system, specifically the standard Moleskine with 31 lines to a page.<br><br>But when I'm using a "no-list" system I use sheets of A4 lined paper on a refill pad.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2016 at 19:36 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>mark h. take a look at the Hipster PDA, as a way to hold together the index cards.<br>index cards and binder clip.<br>can also get holder boxes for index cards with tabbed cards for A-Z, 43, months<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_PDA<br><br>some great focused ideas to explore, in practice, agree, does get unwieldy<br>I still do use occasionally when out for the day, and want something super focused, small, to put into pocket, and where pull out and read/enter info on smartphone still feels too slow and or dangerous (theft)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 May 2016 at 21:16 | matthewS</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Matthews<br><br>I've tried using index cards several times over the years, but can never use them successfully.

If I have to do certain tasks before leaving the house, and I have an hour left, the clipboard is good for one list, which I throw away.  I don't need a notebook for this.  It doesn't accumulate in the notebook. If  I have a project coming up today and I have to finish it today, one list on the clipboard is sufficient which I throw away. <br><br>However, I am trying to keep a catch-all list, or AF list, or AF-like list in my notebook.  If I don't look at it enough times I won't get through the list.  <br><br>WIth a catch-all list, or AF list, I would put the tasks at the end of the list and do them.
