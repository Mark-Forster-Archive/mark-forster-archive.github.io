I didn't have any trouble using it and I completed (or worked on) more than I did with closed lists.<br><br>I have separate lists for: on the road, shopping, repetitive, waiting on that I don't implement in Autofocus. On the road and shopping is "parallelized" as I can do most of the tasks on those lists together. I prefer to have Waiting On separately as I can review it whenever I want and Repetitive is something I read daily and I don't want to miss 1 item in case I haven't parsed all the lists.<br><br>I don't put very small tasks on the list (like "make coffee") which is better for me as I see a small list which gets checked often (which is encouraging). I have some tasks which I rezist doing and I am forced (by the system) to use the little and often approach (they remain last on the page so I have to do ... something, from them). <br><br>Thanks for the system Mark.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2009 at 11:26 | Bogdan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"I am forced (by the system) to use the little and often approach (they remain last on the page so I have to do ... something, from them)"<br><br>Eh, you're not forced to do anything. You don't have to do anything. You choose. You can always dismiss the items.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 February 2009 at 18:56 | Kevin Geoghegan</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have tried several management systems in the past - all were defeated by the nature of my work: I project manage several multi-site projects with large teams of people and a lot happening all at once. <br><br>My last system was based on DIT and closed lists with additions of my own to manage contexts, priorities, deadlines, people and project strategies. And I now see that its weakness was exactly that; it classified and categorized and analyzed things. AF just gets things done. <br><br>AF handles the torrent of tasks with amazing ease and efficiency. The more items I throw in there the better it works. It has something to do with the random collection of different tasks that get thrown together on the one page. This mixture gives my right-brain a good choice of what to do next. Sometimes a simple easy thing that is fun. Sometimes a meaty chunk of serious heavy lifting in excell or Primavera (our corporate project management system).<br><br>Things that used to get prioritized to the bottom of the heap (and so never saw the light of day) bow get done early and with pleasure.<br><br>Things that used to get procrastinated to death because they were difficult or nasty or involved conflict etc - they stay on the page until they are the last ones there - then I have to deal with them. Even if I just make a start. Something simple to move it onwards. Then I can cross it off and close the page - a wonderful feeling.<br><br>And if the task is really hard to deal with; I just enter new tasks to analyze the problem, get the files out, meet and discuss it with a friend, or decompose it into simple easier steps. And then I cross it off and close the page. Yay!<br><br>I agree that I dont HAVE to progress the item - I could just dismiss it (and often do). But many high-resistance items that were never progressing before and now flying along effortlessly now because I did not WANT to dismiss them or COULD NOT do so and keep my job.<br><br>I spent endless hours twiddling around with the previous systems (including GTD) spending time 'organizing' and 'analyzing' and 'prioritizing' things instead of getting on with them.<br><br>So Mark - from the bottom of my heart - a big THANK YOU for this system.<br><br>Paul<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 February 2009 at 16:10 | Paul O&#39;Brien</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm also really enjoying auto-focus, which I'm using both at home and at work. <br><br>I'm having my ups and downs with it at work; on some days it works great but recently I've been so busy with urgent stuff that I've been either not looking at it at all (because I know what I have to be doing and don't have much choice) or else I'm stuck on the last two or three pages. I've not been back to the start of the list in weeks, which isn't ideal, but I am reading through it at least once a week and I know I can get back to it at some point. Hopefully I'll get moving again soon.<br><br>At home it's a different story. Before AutoFocus, I was setting myself tasks to do each evening I was at home, and often struggling to get them all done, or just feeling resentful that I had to do them (even ones that weren't at all unpleasant). I would often get quite stressed and angry with myself for not completing them. <br><br>Now I really enjoy any 'discretionary time' and look forward to getting on with my AutoFocus list. Despite the fact that I've been much busier since January, with lots to do for my wedding, which is coming up soon, as well as all the usual day-to-day stuff, I'm feeling much less stressed and more positive about how I use my time. Even my fiance commented that he thinks the new system is much better - just from the fact that I'm less stressed and no longer a slave to my lists in the same way.<br><br>Fingers crossed I can start really making it work in the office too.<br><br>Thanks Mark!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 March 2009 at 21:57 | Kirsty</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Kirsty - Congratulations on your coming wedding!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 March 2009 at 15:50 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
