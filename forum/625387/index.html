And, as you say, putting something like "Plan Summer Holiday" then acts as a prompt for associated tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 11:22 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes Steve, and one of the things I have found is that AF has prompted me to be more disciplined about how I keep any project related stuff together.  Part of my previous resistance to larger tasks was due to the fact that, if I hadn't worked on something for a while, I didn't remember where all the related stuff (particularly computer files!) was.  Almost invariably now any first project task such as "start project x" leads on to "plan (system/filing structure/procedure) for project x" which stops me just diving in and then forgetting what I had done later.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 11:43 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine:<br><br>Yes, that's a very good example of how the system encourages you to set up a system rather than do continuous "work arounds".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 11:48 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I set up a second AF notebook just for the project of organizing my basement. I had an item in my main AF notebook that said organize the basement but I was feeling major resistance to it. So I decided to do the "do little and often" and just went down there to see what needed to be done. That's when it hit me that the basement could be a "different location" with its own notebook.<br><br>It's working great. When I see organize the basement in my main book, I know there will be something that will stand out in my basement book that will be easy to do. I don't have the feeling of being overwhelmed by the project and I know I am keeping track of all the different parts.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 12:45 | Donna Gordon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That sounds really good Donna.  I have started setting up task lists in some of my projects which I can see will probably turn into their own mini-AF lists.  I even noticed it with my last shopping list - I was a lot more focused, some items were dismissed and others rephrased (replaced with an alternative).  Is there anything we can't autofocus!!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 12:55 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Does this veer toward the contexts of GTD?

For me it feels like a natural extension of using AF but and more part of my general project planning which I would tend to keep separate anyway.  Some of the things will definately stay, or be put, on my main AF list but otheres feel like they should be treated as "separate location".  Using the shopping list analogy it makes sense to me to have a separate shopping list rather than include "buy fuses" on my main list.  I felt Autofocus encourage me to change that specific task to "add fuses to shopping list".  Would be interested in Mark's views .........?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 15:49 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I've been meaning to do a blog post on contexts, which I think just may be the most misunderstood part of GTD. There's a tendency to over-elaborate and obsess over just the right context for each task, which then becomes one more way for people to tinker with their systems instead of doing their actual work. Then they turn around and decide that contexts are useless and declare that they're not going to use them. A better approach is to assign contexts as and when they present themselves -- precisely when it becomes clear that you can't do a task at your present location or with the resources available at that moment, but will be able to later under different circumstances. Or that it just makes sense after you've done one sort of task (say an e-mail or a phone call) to go ahead and get the others like it out of the way while you've got the tools at hand. Every time you make a grocery list you're using a context-based action list, and the benefit of not having "buy milk" and "buy coffee" and "buy bread" scattered randomly among all your other to-dos should be obvious even to people who claim they don't use contexts. Make them work for you, which is exactly what Donna was doing when she started a separate Autofocus list for her basement.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 17:52 | eurobubba</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>That's a clear and smart explanation of contexts, and basically the way I've understood them.<br><br>A shopping list is a great example of what makes a "context" valuable and makes me wonder about using them to some degree within AutioFocus.<br><br>It just makes sense to put all your grocery items on a grocery list, not add each one to the mix of an AF list (I think).<br><br>But then does it also make sense to make, say, a "calls" list, and just have an AF item "make calls"? Or a yard work list? A "the kids are home" list?<br><br>Something tells me, that, generally, breaking out such lists would defeat the magic of AF, but, clearly, not all lists would (a grocery list).<br><br>Just thinking...<br><br>ds</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 18:15 | ds</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ds, I think that's something each of us have to decide for ourselves (which was kind of my point). Intuitively, does being on the phone, or in the yard, or with the kids feel like a distinct set of circumstances from being at your desk, or wherever you spend most of your time? Yard work definitely sounds like a separate context to me, and it would seem awkward to intersperse yardwork tasks with deskbound ones, for example. Personally I do use an @Phone context, but I could probably drop it with no ill effects. In practice I don't have enough phone call tasks to make much difference, and most of the times I don't have a phone with me are times I wouldn't be working through a task list anyway.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 January 2009 at 19:23 | eurobubba</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi,<br>What i've been doing is using my origianl AF book, but for<br>projects, think about. .  ., etc, I'm working from the "back of<br>the notebook" forward.

I already had the basis for this system in a notebook before I found out about it (ie, a long list of things I wanted to accomplish over the previous week while on holiday).  I've since realised I need one notebook to focus me on what needs done at home and with my family, one that I can keep my own personal project tasks in and the essential shopping list notebook (which will be a smaller one I think).  I like the idea of a longer list to choose something from rather than feeling constrained by a small list...the longer list gives a greater feeling of freedom and choice while at the same time allowing for the pleasure of seeing items crossed out.  I've been writing a lot of very small tasks in with the bigger ones as well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 January 2009 at 0:30 | Barbara</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@ Bob<br><br>do you then put in your main list:<br>"Check B List" ?<br>How does that work in practice ? - I could imagine (or would be afraid) that the B list would end up being a list that doesnt actually get thought about much?<br><br>I'm adding ideas and "Think about X" to the main list, then as I think about them I add them to my hold-all PIM type programme - where of course they could end up just as uncared for!

Keep it all in one book.  <br><br>I have my main AF list in the front of the book, but it will have a task stating:"Work on reporting May 2010 (1)".  The (1) refers to a reference at the back of the book where the project is listed with all its sub-tasks.  The project steps will be in a AF format.<br><br>I do not think this deviates from Mark Foster's idea of getting the right/left brain together, because from my main AF list I will decide that I am ready for project: "Reporting May 2010 (1)" and I can then decide in the sub-AF list what task I am specifically in the mood of doing.<br><br>I do sometimes include project related steps/tasks in my main AF list, but I make sure that all projects are listed in my main AF list.<br><br>Note: The using of the word "project" above relates to an outcome involving more than one step.  "Phone John" is not a project and will only be on main AF list, but if my project is "World Domination" and phoning John is a necessary step in this project, then it will be included in the project list at the back.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 May 2010 at 12:45 | Nico McDonald (South Africa)</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
