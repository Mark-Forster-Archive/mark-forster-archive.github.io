Since I tried every method of MF I think it's the best method I ever tried for DOING things. Except one thing. I stay sometime quiet a long time on a page and it blocks me often half a day. When I do my dayly review I often notice I have done some tasks I could really avoid and they took me sometime quiet a long time.  <br><br>So, as I red a very interesting page of MF the STOP DOING LIST relayed by Ryan Freckleton thanks to him ! <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/4/14/action-versus-activity.html">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/4/14/action-versus-activity.html</a>  <br><br>In MF thread, the idea is to understand the "difference between action and activity" and to avoid " to fall into the activity trap if some principle are revealed. <br><br>I found this topic very interesting and it gave me many ideas about SF. <br><br> I made myself a new rule which is incredible efficient. <br><br>As you know the rule forbit to go to the next page until all tasks in C2 are not achieved" So If I don't feel ready to achieve this C2 column for any reason (most of the time energy available) I simply reformulated each tasks, put it on the C2 column (on the next page as unfinished) and dismiss all the C1 column of my actual page. AND, Then, I turned the page. <br><br>I noticed I erased a lot of tasks in C1 of my active page. Reported a lot of them on my last page on C1, put some real must do tasks on the C2 column of the next page which hes a bit increased, but not too much. <br><br>Of course it went much faster and I could stay on the flow. <br><br>Doing this rule, I dont strictly obey to the rules I guess. But it s so good to finish my work and advance and it force me to put at last many of the dismissed task in a "stop doing list" and let me concentrate on the core of my job. <br><br>I wondered if some of you has the same experience. Mark, what do you think about it ?<br><br>Thanks to all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 May 2011 at 20:40 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Just an interesting results with this technic as I just finished my daily SF review (reading, erasing, reporting) I have about 50 tasks per page (C1+C2) <br><br>I had 6 pages of tasks. 4 are dismissed. <br>Are left 1 page and a half<br>On my last active page C1 = 17 task all are really active. On C2 13 tasks all are urgent and must do tasks. ON my last page 14 tasks are active and there is one unfinished. <br><br>OUF !</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 May 2011 at 21:13 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Let me get this straight: if you decide not to do all the tasks on C2, then you push some of these back a page and dismiss C1. Is this right?  I don't quite understand why this is an attractive rule.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 May 2011 at 22:54 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wait a minute, Jupiter, why do you dismiss all the C1's (if the page is not full)?  It sounds to me like you have perfectly legitimate C1's, and their only shortcoming is that they are getting in your way because you currently have a disproportionate number of urgent tasks on other pages.  <br><br>And then, with some of them, you're going a step further and designating them for the "stop doing" list (??).  To me, the purpose of the stop-doing list is to weed out the "busy work", or the work that is taking up too much of your time because it is not that important in your grand scheme of things.  In other words, the candidates for stop-doing are the types that you &lt;&lt;generally&gt;&gt; do that cause you to waste time and only cause "activity".<br><br>Can't you just continue with your C2's the way you are doing (hopefully, gaining some control in the near future) without messing with your 'normal' C1's so much?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2011 at 7:43 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>HI ! <br><br>Just to precise it is an exceptional situation which happen only when there is a sudden increasement of my pages. <br><br>@Alan,  "if you decide not to do all the tasks on C2, then you push some of these back a page and dismiss C1" Yes the rules says that when on an active page you arrive on a C2 column on a task you must do something on it before turning the page. It is mostly what I do except for some reluctant tasks, so I can't turn the page because they are not finished. <br><br>" I don't quite understand why this is an attractive rule." It is because it cleans my list and as I date each day on my list I noticed I come back to the items I wrote yesterday instead of the one I wrote one or two weeks ago. It's much better ! and much focus. <br><br>@BKK<br>"Wait a minute, Jupiter, why do you dismiss all the C1's (if the page is not full)?" <br>The page is full. C1 is full and C2 is OK too.<br><br>"have a disproportionate number of urgent tasks on other pages. " yes you got it I use this rule because I noticed reading my all list in the morning that there are some really urgent tasks and must do tasks which are on the others pages and most of the time on my lsta page and I must do them now. So As I can't turn the page I am stuck. <br><br>"In other words, the candidates for stop-doing are the types that you &lt;&lt;generally&gt;&gt; do that cause you to waste time and only cause "activity".<br>Your are perfectly right. They are often dismissed tasks, mainly recurrent. And I decide not to do them anymore so I try to delegate them. <br><br>"Can't you just continue with your C2's the way you are doing (hopefully, gaining some control in the near future) without messing with your 'normal' C1's so much?"<br>Yes I could. Then I would apply the original rules but will stay with so, many pages. The advantage of this technick is cleaning the list. It is like a karsher which eliminates all what must be. It is like if I was taking a new note book. <br><br>I admit again I dont do it alway. It is exceptionnal. Only when the list becomes un manageable because of the numbers of pages. It also happened to me with Autofocus (which was also a very good system by itself except for urgencies.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2011 at 8:02 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One other thing, Jupiter, in your statement above, where you say that it is forbidden "to go to the next page until all tasks in C2 (are achieved)".  How do you interpret the word "achieved"?  Do you mean getting it to some sort of desired level?  Or do you mean finished, acabado, terminée?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2011 at 8:35 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Okay, Jupiter, I wrote that last one before I saw your response to me and Alan. <br><br>Now, I see that you are saying, "I can't turn the page because they are not finished".  I guess this interpretation is what drives you a little bit mad - because you feeeeeel so bad turning that page.  I guess it comes down to the fact that the more you put into it (taking care of those C2's, and at least one C1), the more benefits you will reap using the system, but sometimes, it's difficult.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2011 at 9:05 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@BKK if I understand correctly MF Rule " CAN'T" turn the page until C2 of the  active page is not finished" doesn't mean You have to comletly do it. It means you have to work on it, even a small task. Watever the time it takes you. Then if it is unfinished it goes on the next page (C2)<br><br>The point is that sometime, I dont want to start the projet. I dont work to work on it because I know it will take a long time and I need to do all on a batch; sO i TAKE THE RISK NOT TO ADVANCE ON THE PROJECT or the Task and i simply report it ont the next page on C2 as unfished and not even began. So I can work on my list. <br><br>This is what I meant with this tread.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2011 at 10:44 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I give you another tip I often use when I am on the rush. Ie my list is getting longuer and longuer and I really need to dive into action. <br><br>I simply take a post it or a piece of paper, extract all calls, do and waiting for for the day and stick it on the notepart of my note book. <br><br>It is only for what is regarding TODAY. So I can treat them as a batch and it's fine; Then I do a ping pong between my SF list and my hotlist. <br><br>Hope it will be usefull for some one.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2011 at 12:21 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey Jupiter, I am glad you got into this because I wanted to think about it, as well.  If there is anything I want out of a system, it's confidence.<br><br>I agree, anytime we are pressed, we can always take out a Post-It or do a quick top-priority list in Toodledo.  <br><br>As a reminder to get back to SF whole-heartedly, it seems like it would be a good idea to do at least something on each and every C2 on that page, no matter if it were just reviewing the project file, or your dated reminders on the computer, etc.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for clarifying.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2011 at 12:56 | BKK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>TIP #3 When I write an item no matter in C1 or C2 I often write the next action. This one comes from GTD. It's very usefull because when it's achieves I Can directly go to the next action or report it at the end of my list or as unfinished C2 on the next page. <br><br>This tip save me a lot of Time<br><br>Tip #4 I often write the project name or the context in parenthesis after the item. I always write the name of the person concerned at the beginning of the item. So I can easely find project, contexts, people reading a long list. I love this one because it is very efficient on the rush.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2011 at 14:09 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>When I know something needs doing, but I'm stuck on it, I think a resolution is to think about that item and define a small next action, and thus rewrite the item.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2011 at 14:47 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I just bought 2 fantastic app for Ipad  !!!!<br><br><br>Omnioutliner for ipad <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner-ipad/">http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner-ipad/</a><br>And the incredible mindmap tool ithought <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ithoughts.co.uk/Start/Welcome.html">http://www.ithoughts.co.uk/Start/Welcome.html</a><br><br>They are just perfect with Omnifocus for ipad <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-ipad/">http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-ipad/</a><br><br>And SUPERFOCUS OF COURSE !!!!<br><br>Ouaouuhhh !</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 May 2011 at 20:56 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I did look into iThought at one time.
