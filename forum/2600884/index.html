How can you have a process to get somewhere when you ignore that there's a 'somewhere'?! That's madness! Do you also have a daily habit of jumping into your car to focus on the process of driving instead of mainly focusing on getting somewhere?!".<br><br>And the latest, "Set a destination and the obstacles to it, then focus on how you'll get around the obstacles and create a simple plan."<br><br>Where do you stand? Thoughts?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2016 at 2:49 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here is the thinking process I try to follow:<br><br>On some kind of regular cadence:<br>1.  Decide what results I want<br>2.  Figure out what actions / behaviors are required to get the results.<br>3.  Execute the actions / behaviors.<br>4.  Evaluate if the actions / behaviors are delivering the results. <br>5.  Make adjustments as needed (both on the desired results, and the means to achieve them)<br><br>I think the daily practice of time management is mostly concerned with (3).<br><br>In the "driving car" example -- you don't think about the process anymore because you've already internalized it, and it's become a habit -- i.e., you've learned how to drive a car, and presumably how to navigate roads and highways, etc.   You would not be able to "focus on your destination" AT ALL, unless you had already mastered all the process steps.<br><br>The process exists to get the results -- but this example highlights the problem of putting too much emphasis on tracking the results and not the process.   If you don't have a good understanding of the process, and all you want is the result of being at your destination, you are not likely even to arrive at your destination!   You won't even be able to operate the car, or at least not safely / legally / dealing with road situations / etc.<br><br>This applies to business as well:  if all you focus on is profit -- and not what actually GENERATES profit, such as good marketable products and happy customers -- then you won't generate any profits.  You need to figure out what actions and processes are going to enable you to reach your objective -- and then focus your attention on executing  those actions and processes, pausing from time to time to evaluate whether they are delivering the expected results.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2016 at 5:27 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Michael B:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Focus on the RESULT. Forget about the process. Activities can change! Effectiveness before ego! Just keep adjusting your approach until you succeed! &gt;&gt;<br><br>The problem with this approach is that too much focus on the result at too early a stage can actually be detrimental. All you need to know about the end result is enough to guide your present actions. The detail of the result is something that will evolve naturally as you work on the process.<br><br> &lt;&lt; No, no, no. Focus on the PROCESS. Forget about the results. Just design daily habits that are repeatable and you'll get somewhere! &gt;&gt;<br><br>I have a lot of sympathy with this approach and I think the objection "How can you have a process to get somewhere when you ignore that there's a 'somewhere'?" is laughable. For a start processes are tools and as such are interchangeable between projects. Secondly it's very difficult to use a tool without knowing what you are using it for - as the car example suggests. If you are going to drive from London to Edinburgh, then it's the process of driving, comfort stops, fuel monitoring etc. which you need to concentrate on, not constantly reminding yourself what an attractive city Edinburgh is. And that basic process would be exactly the same if you were driving to Cardiff instead of Edinburgh.<br><br>&lt;&lt; "Set a destination and the obstacles to it, then focus on how you'll get around the obstacles and create a simple plan. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I think this is pretty useless advice. You usually don't know what the precise obstacles are going to be in advance. What you do know is that there WILL be obstacles. What you need therefore is a range of processes and tools which can be brought into play when you meet the actual real world obstacles. The advice as it stands is the equivalent of making a plan to avoid being interrupted by Mr Jones and then getting interrupted by Mrs Smith instead, rather than having processes in place to prevent interruptions in general.<br><br>All the proposed methods (including Seraphim's which otherwise I agree with) leave out one of the the essential first steps - which is to assess where you are at present.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2016 at 11:24 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think how I am is "focus on the biggest picture you can handle".<br><br>Going back to that car analogy, of course if you are new to driving you won't be able to focus on anything much other than how to drive.  But when you have the skills of driving you can focus on other things like planning for a road trip or something like that.  And then when you have handled that you can focus on the drive itself.<br><br>I think that also takes into account what Mark was saying: to assess where you are at present.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2016 at 18:59 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great answers so far!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 May 2016 at 23:40 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I believe a destination and a workable process are needed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 May 2016 at 14:44 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I move between both levels, and the levels in between, frequently. If a process isn't working (or is boring), I look at the end result. Given what I now know, is this still one of the better ways to get to the desired result? Is that result still desired, especially given what I now know about the process?<br><br>I used to be Quality Assurance Manager, and had to examine, improve and document the entire quality system for ISO-9000 registration. It took a long time for some of the people to realize that they could suggest changes. Believe it or not, when I found a way to make something easier was when I got the most push-back. Duplication of work. An improved form or order of approval. Multiple copies of the final document.
