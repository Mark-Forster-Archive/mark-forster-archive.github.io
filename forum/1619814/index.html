And if this definition is wrong, that's also okay. The value of Imperfectionism is that by following it, you can get a lot done quickly. This is great when you have a lot to do in little time.  Many things are better done poorly than completely undone. <br><br>So having accomplished a lot in very little time, what's to do but go back and make some things better?  Judge which need bettering, and which are okay. Improve the former and call them done. Still have time?  Reexamine done things and improve some. Leave the rest imperfect. In the end, all is done, a few done very well. In sum, a good conclusion. <br><br>It's like a History exam. Answering the first essay question exquisitely gets 10 points.

I think perfectionism has currently got a bad name in personal development circles, and maybe the pendulum needs to swing back a bit the other way.<br><br>For instance we are always told that goals should be believable, yet I have been experimenting lately with unachievable goals and have found them very powerful. To give a fictitious example, what if I had a goal to become a concert pianist? There's no way in which someone of my age could do that from scratch. But what if I behaved as if I could? Would I make far more progress than if my goal were to "learn to play the piano"? My experiments are suggesting that I would.<br><br>As I've occasionally mentioned on this website, I drive a Porsche. A Porsche is to all intents and purposes a perfect car. It's designed to be perfect. It works perfectly and never goes wrong. And it's a completely different driving experience, even in a town, than any of the imperfect cars which most people drive (and which I drive when I'm not driving the Porsche). And there are so many other aspects of life in which someone who is aiming for perfection raises things to a completely new level.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 October 2011 at 8:36 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"Impossible goals" and perfectionism are not the same thing at all.  <br><br>An impossible goal is one which, objectively, cannot be achieved.  Perfectionism is where you spend disproportionate resources on a trivial improvement - reprinting a document because one full stop is slightly misplaced, for example.  (That's an example - arguably - of bad perfectionism but one can certainly think of examples of good perfectionism).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 October 2011 at 10:18 | AndrewW</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andrew:<br><br>Well, my dictionary (Oxford Dictionary of English) defines "perfectionism" as "refusal to accept any standard short of perfection".

Yard work and house cleaning -- very much not perfection! <br><br>And I exercise perfectionism very selectively for certain work projects. My workplace tends to favor quick turnaround/iterative stuff, so I tend to want to perfect my processes for supporting quick turnarounds than for ephemeral products. The cost/value ratio doesn't support perfect products. But even then, I have to watch out that I don't lose sight of what I'm trying to perfect and why; I can easily lose myself in the abstract perfectionist process and lose sight of the ephemeral document that is actually what I'm getting paid to produce.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 October 2011 at 14:47 | Mike Brown</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wait: you get paid to produce ephemeral documents?!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 October 2011 at 15:39 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>There was a story last year about a middle age man who was laid off and discovered accidentally that he had a beautiful voice.

This is my first post on the forum!<br>I felt called upon from this topic, cause I've been picked on to be a "perfectionist" many times.<br>To me what Mark intends for being a perfectionist is something different from the meaning that Alan is giving. Alan is talking about the consequences that can arise from the "refusal to accept any standard short of perfection".

I believe the focus is absolutely a good thing. Two things seem to be adjustable though:<br>1. Working a bit on this other thing needn't distract from my general focus, so it's okay to get started. <br>2. The item I'm focused on, sometimes doesn't need to be perfected in every respect. Maybe it doesn't need to be comprehensive, or final. By switching up, it keeps another item from languishing, and also keeps me alert to the other important things. It's easier to stop perfecting one thing, when the next thing is in mind, which may be more important.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 October 2011 at 12:27 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Lorenzo:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Perfectionsts often do this because don't handle well critiques, so they try to prevent those being always perfect. &gt;&gt;<br><br>That would be an example of doing something to show how good you are, rather than doing it in order to become better.

The "little and often" approach supports this very well. The art here is to decide when to stop improving, i.e deciding whether to re-enter the topic at the end of the list or leave it at that (in AF/SF terms). Perfectionists (like myself) will tend to do much more iterations. But even there, the "standing out" of AF/SF can (could?) be helpful in distinguishing between areas where perfectionism has value and those where it's just overhead and the famous 80/20 principle is the way to go.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 October 2011 at 13:58 | Marc (from Brussels)</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan's "Imperfectionism" reminds me of what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls "robustness", as opposed to "over-optimization" which leads to fragility.  "Robustness" means something can survive random events, vs. over-optimization which might work very well in very constrained circumstances but breaks down quickly if the situation changes slightly or is impacted by randomness.<br><br>What's a good name for the good kind of perfectionism that Mark describes, that isn't prone to the negative connotations?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 October 2011 at 14:31 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I vote to keep the word "perfectionism" for all the negative connotations.<br><br>Maybe, as suggested earlier, "continuous improvement" or "pride in your work" for the positive side. Although the second can turn too easily into "if not perfect, then you don't take pride in your work".<br><br>The trap of inappropriate perfectionism is easy to fall into. Mark's right, though -- never aspiring to be perfect, or at least better, is just as dangerous.<br><br>I have trouble letting my kids dream, even though I know that they need to. I'm afraid of the crash. Intellectually, I know that most dreams will fade and be replaced by something that's more realistic that they will have fun achieving, but as they get older I have trouble keeping my mouth shut.<br><br>My voice teacher says adults practise much less than kids. Parents expect their kids to practise and reach milestones. Terrible things will happen (take the "why kids should learn an instrument brochure and turn it backwards") if they don't. Adults expect to enjoy learning and take the occasional exam as a fun challenge.<br><br>Seraphim, you must be an engineer at heart. We chanted that theory/practice mantra during many lab sessions.<br><br>Another side of perfectionism is "I can't do it perfectly, so I won't do it at all." Rather than quickly cleaning the traffic areas often and sometimes doing a corner or two, you do nothing until even the traffic area is an all-day chore. It becomes a vicious cycle. As has been said here, little and often, and good planning (do the traffic areas first), works.<br><br>JD: I always thought the second verse was something like:<br>But God, grant me the courage not to give up on what I think is right, even though I think it is hopeless.<br><br>Google disagrees.

You're right -- it doesn't't work.<br><br>However, people who are prone to depression often interpret the same track record in a pessimistic manner.<br><br>Seligman's book The Optimistic Child covers the difference between boosterism and practical, earned optimism, which, as you suggest, concentrates on a track record of success.<br><br>At the extreme, pessimistic people perceive bad things are permanent, pervasive (all areas of their lives) and personal (my fault), and good things as impermanent, specific an impersonal. "We got this contract because we worked hard on this project and everyone else on the team did a great job. It probably won't happen again," vs "We got this contract, and will get more, because we are a team that works hard, and I'm a valuable member of it."<br><br>Likewise, for something bad, "We lost the contract, and will lose many more, because I screwed everything up and I bring the team down," vs "We lost this specific contract because Joe missed a paragraph in the spec and I made an important typo. We won't make those mistakes again."<br><br>It's as much how that success is interpreted as whether it exists. According to Seligman, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy helps you interpret the track record in a more positive manner. (I don't know enough about CBT to know if what he calls CBT really is, but whatever he calls it, much of his book makes sense.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 October 2011 at 4:00 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Choose to perfect your field, but leave the rest imperfected. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I used to make my living out of coaching artists, musicians, authors, etc. who were brilliant in their field but the rest of their lives were in chaos.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 October 2011 at 8:49 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Cricket:<br><br>&lt;&lt; That article describes the problems with what Martin Seligman calls 'boosterism", which is built on repetition and the Law of Attraction and other techniques that don't have a foundation. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Whatever Martin Seligman calls it, the concept of "self-esteem" is firmly entrenched in our education system and has had in my opinion extremely pernicious effects.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 October 2011 at 8:52 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark:<br><br>You don't need to have the ability of a NASA astronaut to keep a better order in your life or to do the job that pays your bills, if your target is to win the world fishing championship.

Neither Lorenzo nor I are arguing for chaos in anything. Our contention is not with " a room that is perfectly organized with a place for everything, or one that has stuff piled up all over the place", as we agree the latter is harder. The dispute is, "a room that is perfectly organized with a place for everything" versus, "one that has a few things out of place".<br><br>Mark appears to suggest that aiming for the perfect in all things is the best. In contradiction, I say aiming for the perfect in few things, while accepting second-best in the rest is far superior.  This is because perfect us much much harder than imperfect, and keeping a spotless room spotless is much harder than keeping a clean room cleanish. In aiming for the top of everything, you will have less time and energy to aim for the top in the most crucial things.  So emphasize the key areas more, and no when good-enough applies to the rest.  This doesn't mean accepting chaos anywhere.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 October 2011 at 12:58 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Our contention is not with " a room that is perfectly organized with a place for everything, or one that has stuff piled up all over the place", as we agree the latter is harder.

Why on earth would you think a room is better if some things don't have a place?

But I want to feel it in every aspect of my life.<br>But that is something different from what I was thinking while writing about Perfectionism. I will clarify it.<br>I can cook. In fact I think I'm pretty good at cooking. Sometimes I cook for many people, and I enjoy to do it. With the years, I've equiped my kitchen just like I want it: not many tools, only good tools, very well organized. I know where everything is, even the small boxes buried in the higher shelf. So that's a field where I can say I'm good enought for me, and already taking advantage of that energy boost. But you know, I'm far from being perfect. Very far. I've got at least two friends of mine that are true cooks that can beat me in every single skill in the kitchen. Yes that is normal, they're professionals! Even if I'm well organized, I'm not trying to be perfect as a cook, I'm just an amateur having fun in his kitchen!<br>Misunderstanding is lying here.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 October 2011 at 15:16 | Lorenzo</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan:<br><br>&lt;&lt;Wait: you get paid to produce ephemeral documents?! &gt;&gt;<br><br>:) As a technical writer, I have to produce lots of reports and bureaucratic stuff that ticks a checkbox on someone else's list, but that is 'archived' and not referred to again.

To me, this was "perfect" -- I provided all the details someone might need, with a summary for people who might not have time.   Problem:  It took too long to write.

And I tried it.  <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://five.sentenc.es/">http://five.sentenc.es/</a><br>	<br>I find I get more response, and more discussion, more quickly, and if people need more details, they ask for them.   Or we have a phone call or meeting.<br>	<br>The 5-sentence email turns out to be a ***lot*** closer to perfection than my 2-page detailed emails with executive summaries.    (Assuming the goal has always been clear timely communication that results in appropriate and timely decisions and actions.)<br><br>It also turns out that the 5-sentence rule is a lot more ***robust*** -- in line with Alan's idea of "imperfection".    It's a lot easier to FINISH a 5-sentence email and get it sent out in a timely manner.  It's a lot harder to break the process when the process is so lightweight.<br><br>Which makes me think...
