Into my seventh decade, I have tried so many different personal productivity approaches/techniques/whatever, from MBO to Seven Star, from Outlook to GTD, and beyond.<br><br>By and large I KNOW that AF, and AF4 in particular, is the best or better solution for me (I'm self-employed and sometimes operate from feast to famine).  This forum has been great as I have used to wonder if I was the only one with a severe procrastination issue - now I know I'm not alone!<br><br>Longer serving members of this forum may recall a few of my earlier posts in which I described how I have adapted AF to my work and lifestyle, which is working abroad in "Strange Places, (with) Questionable People" (to paraphrase the BBC's John Simpson in one of his books) on short-term assignments in the water sector (in a non-engineering capacity).<br><br>The quest for the ultimate solution for ME is possibly one reason for my procrastination in many areas.  I have found myself over the year oscillating between paper and digital solutions, and have not yet settled on one approach for a reasonable length of time.<br><br>Have any other members found a modus operandi that combines the paper and the computer/PDA approach?  I have grown attached to my Moleskine notebook and gel pen, yet I've looked at loose-leaf solutions as well.  All the while, I use Outlook and have toyed with other digital solutions, especially as I also use a Windows Mobile PDA.<br><br>In my latest incarnation, I have set up AF4 in ListPro (tried MLO, GTD, Michael Linenburger;s approach, I think I abhor the overhead of some digital solutions).  With ListPro on both my notebook and HTC Windows Phone, I am able to shift items around from Current to Backlog and capture in Deferred (Context).  The last one is because I acknowledge that some tasks cannot be done in my current context, eg when away on assignment, I cannot do certain Home and Home Office tasks.<br><br>By using the following labels, I have found I can group tasks in a logical alpha-sequence thus:<br>BACKLOG/CLOSED<br>CURRENT/OPEN<br>DEFERRED (CONTEXT)<br>LTBW (let the bastard wait)<br><br>Right now, I think I'll use my Moleskine notebook on right-hand pages to jot down new items as I think of them, then transfer to ListPro later in the day (and cross them off in the notebook); the left-hand pages remain to to be used for notes in meetings, telephone calls, doodling.<br><br>I use Outlook to set up reminders and to schedule hard-edge tasks, meetings etc.<br><br>Any of this sound familiar, or daunting?<br><br>Roger 'peripatetic' J</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 December 2009 at 19:10 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello Roger.  This is a timely comment;  I had just this minute come onto the forum to air some thoughts about a closely related topic.<br><br>I too have been following the same path, trying out Covey, GTD, Eat That Frog, Get Everything Done, Do It Tomorrow, Autofocus i - iv etc etc etc over the years.<br><br>The last - Autofocus IV - is showing signs of being the most effective method, and not just for me. There are plenty of comments on this forum from plenty of people endorsing it.   And at its heart,  it is just a big long list with a very few clear and simple rules how to use it.<br><br>HOWEVER - despite the simplicity and clarity of it, people are still looking for that one last 'tweak' that will make it work for them.   If you're anything like me,  you've been looking for that one, final tweak for years now.<br><br>It occurred to me that the problem doesn't lie with AF.  Or DIT or any other method, for that matter.<br><br>AF is doing its job perfectly well.   The problem lies with our inability to keep our attention focussed on the task at hand,  after we've decided what we are going to work on (or in extreme cases, getting distracted while we are in the process of choosing what to do next  ;-)  ).<br><br>Thats how it seems to me, anyway.

Disagree? <br><br>regards  Dave   (distracted three times while composing this post...)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 December 2009 at 22:59 | Dave</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Dave,<br><br>Yes, I do agree, I have a low threshold for boredom and competing distractions.<br><br>I like to feel challenged in most of what I do, to have a purpose.  However, as a one-man business, I HAVE to do some of the boring stuff.  I've tried analysing myself and my habits to no real avail, but somehow I keep on trying.<br><br>Like you and others, AF4 does seem to be the key, but I haven't quite been able to turn the key all the way.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Roger</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 December 2009 at 23:17 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Roger J - LOL at LTBW.....<br>Dave - I would agree at the problem being not focusing on task at hand - I know from experience how easily distracted I get!<br><br>I agree the problem is not sticking to one 'way' - I have been dilly dallying for months as to - actually 12 months.... what system to use - the worst is I haven't actually tried a system out properly, perhaps trying to find the 'perfect' system before I try it out which is sily - precisely why I haven't got anywhere!!!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2009 at 5:21 | Nick</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I picked up a tip in the early days of the forum, or maybe it was in one of Mark's books, that helps me when I HAVE to make progress on an unattractive task:<br><br>I have a kitchen timer in my home office (on the shelf above my standing height desk, almost eye-level), the timer is a digital one available from Maplin in the UK.<br><br>(1) Set it for 5 minutes and work focused on the ONE task<br>(2) When the alarm goes, reset it for 10 minutes and continue<br>(3) Again, reset either by doubling the previous increment or just adding 5 minutes to the previous spell<br>(4) And so on until you've made meaningful progress.<br><br>After five cycles, one has done a minimum of  75 minutes (5 + 10 +15 + 20 + 25) or a maximum of 155 minutes (5 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 80).  I find this helps one get "into" the task, make meaningful progress if not completion, increases satisfaction, decreases damage to self-esteem etc.<br><br>I think it's called a Selami Technique, but the slices get progressively thicker. <br><br>It works, now to put my money where my mouth/keyboard is . . . . . . and get an obstacle out of the way before a hard-edge commitment later today.  I have allowed Christmas and our two granddaughters to be an excuse not to settle into some tasks, although either reason is deemed acceptable 9especially the latter!).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2009 at 9:28 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Forgot to include that my labels cover another Deferred type, Deferred (Reminder Date).<br><br>This is processed by setting a reminder in Outlook, then I can delete the task in ListPro or leave it in place.  Yes, I k now I can also set a reminder in ListPro, but I think ONE application/nagging device is enough.<br><br>Due to my own circumstances, I find the Deferred label works as it is lower down the list, but not altogether out of sight and in danger of being forgotten.  It is especially useful as I can regroup some deferred tasks (as well as LTBWs if I feel like it) under a Travel context and deal with them during a long-haul flight or airport/hotel wait.  I find transferring them to BACKLOG/CLOSED puts them at the top of the list.<br><br>I did try ListPro several months ago, but am finding the latest setup is currently working for me, especially as I can print the list if I want to, show completed tasks crossed out, and synchronise it with my Windows Phone/Mobile PDA (HTC Touch Pro 2).  And I'm still using my Moleskine notebook and Bic metal gel pen!<br><br>BTW, for those interested and who do not have a IiPhone and/or Apple computer, I've used ListPro since 2002, see www.iliumsoft.com <br><br>I also use Ilium's eWallet, a lifesaver when one needs to remember many logins and passwords these days; it also synchronises with a desktop/notebook.  I once returned to the UK after a longish spell abroad and found that I had forgotten my PIN for my ATM/bank card, until I retrieved it from eWallet via my PDA.  The only thing I must not do is forget my password for eWallet!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2009 at 10:01 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"The problem lies with our inability to keep our attention focussed on the task at hand..."<br><br>I've abandoned AF, like most systems, for one reason: the energy being invested in a new systems is, almost always, a defensive move to avoid doing work that I'm scared of. In other words, I (almost) always know what stirs my heard. Of course, those things bring up tremendous resistance. <br><br>The key for me is to form partnerships (with real people) that will hold me accountable. Once those are in place, GTD, AF, Covey, or currently - my own system via The Hit List - all provide a degree of insurance that my tasks and ideas are in one place.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2009 at 15:05 | avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum,<br><br>You hit a few nails on the head.

While I acknowledge that too much energy can be expended in the search for THE Perfect System (for the user), I would be more willing to commit myswlf to partnerships IF I have a decent task/slef management system in place.<br><br>I recall that Mark said that investment in getting task management/admin systems pays off ie having a below par system drags everything down, or is capable  of doing so.<br><br>That said, the Perfect System for most of us is a Holy Grail, (almost) an unattainable state.<br><br>"Keep buggering on."  - Churchill, W S<br><br>Cheers and best wishes for 2010,<br><br>Roger J</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2009 at 19:31 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>What is a "slef management system"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2009 at 19:43 | Mark T.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think Roger meant a "self management system." :-P</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 December 2009 at 21:44 | Musaab</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF4 is working so well for me that I'd encourage anyone 'stuck in the middle' to first watch the animated version (found in "AF4 News" under Most Recent Postings) then try following it precisely for one week, on paper not electronically.  Make yourself follow it without fail for one full week - no cheating, experimenting, or shortcutting.  Try to move as quickly through the lists as Mark did using the little-and-often principle.<br><br>Use Outlook or something similar (something SIMPLE and QUICK) to record reminders.  But stick with paper as much as possible. For different contexts use pages in the back of whatever notebook you use.<br><br>Write everything down.  Don't let yourself stray into doing some task that you haven't written down first; tasks such as taking a quick look at some website or your email.  Write those distracting items down when they occur to you and don't succumb to the temptation to do them until you reach them on your AF4 list. Be disciplined and hard on yourself for one week - be disappointed when you stray, then get back to AF4 until your week is up.<br><br>Watch the animation another time or two during the week and emulate it.

I already have the software on my notebook computer and on my Windows Mobile device, I use it for international assignment check-lists, software key/installation codes etc.<br><br>This latest incarnation for me is an attempt to blend the technology and the pen for my own requirements, and my own perception of my strengths and weaknesses.  I'll use my paper notebook for meeting notes, telephone calls, thinking etc.  Yes, I acknowledge that I may be increasing the effort by re-entering into ListPro, but I write everything down for AF4 in the pen notebook first, even if it is a grasscatcher item.<br><br>It may turn out that ListPro holds the Backlog/Closed list and the paper notebook becomes the Current/Open list.  In the end, all that  matters is what works for me.  That said, your advice about trying it for a week zealously is very tempting, and practical.<br><br>Now, where did I save that AF4 animation download . . . . ?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 January 2010 at 13:08 | Roger J</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Dang it.
