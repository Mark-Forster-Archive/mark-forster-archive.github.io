(Seraphim made that observation too...) Of course it is logical that those heavily iNtuitive would really like AF, as AF relies heavily on intuition.<br><br>Now that the different AFs and DWM have come out, and others have actually abandoned AF/DWM for other TM methodologies, I am quite curious what the make-up will be this time.<br><br>My prediction is this:<br><br>1) AFx - xNxP<br>2) DWM - xNxJ<br>3) abandoned AF/DWM - xNxJ<br><br>I am an INTP.  I use AF1 on paper, and still going strong.  Struggled with AF4 and DWM electronically before this.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 June 2010 at 9:03 | nuntym</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm an INTP but fall into category #3.<br><br>I agree with your assessment of #1 and #2, the P is going to want to leave things hanging and the J is going to go for completion so will like the more Draconian rules of DWM, I think.  OTOH, I can't see that there would be any way to type those who have abandoned AF or DWM as there are probably many other systems they might migrate to and how can you type an unknown system.  Just a thought.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 June 2010 at 9:40 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm an ENFJ and I wonder if this type has anything to do with my inability to stick with one system for very long! I jump from paper to electronic, always tweaking things. For the last couple of months, I've been using Omnifocus and pretty much a full GTD setup, but I'm getting antsy and am thinking about leaving my projects and areas of focus in OF and moving my lists back to an AF format on paper (Home, Work, Waiting For, Freelance).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 June 2010 at 11:00 | Claudia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>ENTP + AF1, AFT4<br><br>I think you'll find a lot more correlation if you review the Keirsey work. M-B based their work on Keirsey but they took liberties with the material to make it softer and kinder.

I happily used AF1 (paper) for a long time, then moved to a very simple Omnifocus implementation.<br><br>I've been (happily) using DWM since it came out. My ADD tendencies like the discrete packets of days. I still use Omnifocus--just a simple folder titled DWM and single action lists for each day.<br><br>All hard deadlines go on my calendar (iCal).<br><br>The advantage of a digital task list and calendar for me is that they both sync to my iPhone so I can update and check them wherever I am.<br><br>No struggles, just a sense that I know what my commitments and priorities are, that I am managing them comfortably, and that I am not overcommitting my time.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 June 2010 at 15:22 | Liz I.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"My prediction is this:<br><br>1) AFx - xNxP<br>2) DWM - xNxJ<br>3) abandoned AF/DWM - xNxJ<br>"<br><br>About this, the J means that the third trait dominates the second, so with NxJ you must wonder what the x is.

I enjoyed them all but dropped them all when life got stressful and/or I got sidetracked. I intend coming back, probably to DWM but I'm sort of waiting to see Mark's new system.<br><br>I often take up call and innovative stuff, then drop it for something else. But I don't like that, it doesn't work for my life.<br><br>Keeping up habits is my biggest challenge in life. I find I can only build one habit at a time, and even then there' is the risk that I'll drop it. It took me months to make flossing my teeth at night a habit. I kept going for nearly a year. Lately I've been focusing on a new habit (skincare morning and night) and I'm doing really well at that but missing days of flossing.<br><br>What does this have to do with the question? I guess I need a TM system that lets me start very small, so small I really can fit it in as my number 1 habit I am working on - even when life puts me into crisis mode. That I don't end up feeling too overwhelmed to look at. It also has to be powerful and enjoyable enough that it's worthwhile. I think Mark's systems aren't really the problem; the problem is me. But I'll get there!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 July 2010 at 1:42 | Savitri</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oops, spelling: "call" should have been "cool"!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 July 2010 at 1:44 | Savitri</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I still use af4 on paper. All my stuff is in a kind of filofax divided in section such as project, and so on. All my digital tried were a wash out. Even omnifocus <br>Finaly i realise that papee gives me a better control on my tasks and thinking. It gives me too a better control about dissmissing things. Some rare time i come back to my list using af1. Anyway af1 or 4 is just a list. <br>I kept from gtd some basic principles. One is taking time to work on projects. Another is having a all updated list of all my projects without any order. <br>I treat that list in a af1 methode like a secont af list. <br>I keep my major deadlines in ical . I need to follow them to focus and think about them.<br>Now my all sustem is indeed simple. I realized that wishing to have my list updated on my iphone was indeed un usefull. There is time to work and time to live.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 July 2010 at 10:41 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>@Savitri,<br><br>If you're willing to, you could give what I do a try:<br><br>For each day just make a couple of brief lists in a small notebook. <br><br>On the right hand page put the things you really want/need to do that day, choosing one or two as MITs (most important tasks) <br><br>Then on the left hand page put the things you'd like to get done, or can do that day, but can wait if need be.<br><br>Then throughout the day tick off items as they get done, add new ones or delete unwanted ones on either list as you feel appropriate.<br><br>Also feel free to allocate new items up to a few days in the future, go back to to items on previous days that haven't been done yet, and go ahead to items on future days if you feel led to.<br><br>Something else I find that helps is to write grasscatcher/distraction items on the bottom of the left hand page instead of allowing them to interrupt me.<br><br>Hope this helps...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 July 2010 at 23:54 | smileypete</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
