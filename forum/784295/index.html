I'm also guessing that if a poll were carried out about time management the age distribution of the pollsters, statistically, would not show as a normal distribution curve.<br><br>My question to Mark and everybody else too, would be: Has anyone studied the  impact of or attitude to time management according to people's age? In extreme terms, to illustrate the question, I would think that a teenager's attitude to time management may be different than that of, say, an octogenarian's. Therefore, perhaps a different  time management system would be appropriate for each group, with age being a critical indicator of the appropriate system in each case.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 May 2009 at 5:10 | Otto Fox</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Otto:<br><br>That is a good question. I'm not aware of any research having been carried out on the subject.<br><br>My own feeling is that teenagers' attitudes to just about everything depend on what their friends think cool at the time. My experience is also that the older you get, the less you care about what anybody else thinks. So the differences are likely to be more a matter of fashion and influence than anything else.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 May 2009 at 9:02 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Funny to look at the two extremes, teens and octogenarian. I think a psychologist's view might be too look at a personality dimension like conscientiousness which is a stable trait for most people and seems to predict the level of organisation an individual possesses (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness).">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness).</a> Then you might speculate, the higher on the scale of conscientiousness the more likely the individual will be productive/organised and thus be using timemanagement principles.  <br><br>On the other hand, when I look at my self, I never became so heavily interested in timemanagement and productivity because of peer influences or fashion, early or later. Few of my (older) friends have any serious interest in it. On a psychologist's personality&amp;intelligence test I used to score pretty low on the 'conscientious' dimension. I was naturally unorganised but once I got out of high school and then add another year or two until I got a sense of what direction I wanted to go in, I found it critical that I became proficient in timemanagement and productivity. If you have ambitious goals and you're not effective and efficient with your time you'll feel a burning desire to learn how, which is what happened with me. And if you're also successful in attaining ambitious goals the more likely you are to be using effective time management methods.<br><br>In high school I didn't really have goals that required me to be effective with my time, I was just going with the semi-obligatory flow of things. Once I got goals that required me to be effective, I developed an interest in productivity systems. So you might say the use  of particular timemanagement methods depend most heavily on the type of goals you have, regardless of age. (and even if you don't have consciously chosen goals, you still have goals in the way of having to achieve outcomes in whatever profession you're in) <br><br>When you approach a octogenarian's age you're just more likely to have learnt all you're open to learn in a lifetime in terms of productivity and timemanagement. Too bad there wasn't any AF in the 50s. At least there was structured procrastination!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 May 2009 at 9:46 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Both Mark and Peter made very interesting comments with which I happen to agree. I think their comments also illustrate how complex the whole matter is.<br><br>To add another thought, I would say that creativity too may play, indirectly, a role in time management. Based on my observations, the persons that one usually describes as "creative" are mostly neither well organised nor very sensitive to time-management. This comment goes beyond the age factor that I mentioned above, but it does illustrate that the right formula for productivity and time management is like salt on one's plate: Each individual needs a different quantity according to their taste.<br><br>Systems like AF are good, because they cater to most tastes. However, it may be that for a really tasty dish, chef Mark may have to provide individual coaching, after detecting what his diner's specific sense of taste is like. Oh! I've just realised that my closing remark really belongs in the "Making money out of AF?" thread.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 May 2009 at 21:41 | Otto Fox</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting thread.  I really wish I had had the knowledge that there were such things as time management systems in school.  I always struggled with completing school assignments on time - except, as I recall, for projects which in hindsight I could take more time over and plan - and it was not until I was in management and had some degree of control over my daily time that I even became aware of TM systems.  I just struggled with TM and believed that I just had a problem, as everyone else just seemed to sail through.<br><br>I do believe that TM is linked to personality type and learning more about those aspects was incredibly helpful to me.  I wonder how much more effective teenagers would be going into the work environment if they were taught the rudiments of TM as part of their education.  Perhaps an interesting social experiment in the making ....?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2009 at 1:39 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Otto<br>I've been highly creative since I was a child.  Because of it, I needed modules of time that I could be free.  But I was also taught how to PLAN and follow a schedule to keep up with my responsibilities at home, keep up high grages, study my art, music, dancing and sports.  It takes lots of dedicated practice to master certain things.  Without devoting myself to a schedule to keep up with my responsibilities and mastering my talents, my creative pursuits would have been much slower and less successful.  I don't understand why people think creative, artistic, musical types are unorganized.  We need to jockey our time judiciously to learn, practice, perform, create, etc.....Even professionally, we artists would pull 17 hour cram sessions for 2 to 3 days in a row.  Try being creative while the proverbial gun is pointed at your temple!  LOL!  We creative types are not fragile, scattered butterflies...........Many of us are very hard working, methodical and driven to succeed in a highly competive field.  When there's one job available for thousands of people who want it, the competition is fierce.  Also, an artist is only as good as his last show reviews........No, Otto......our career forces us to be quite adept at time management  systems to see our amibitions stay alive!  We need a free mind to create our best......but, having that requires a willingness to plan well and work extremely hard in the interim!  LOL!<br>learning as I go<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2009 at 3:06 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>I believe that a person's relative need to master time management rests on his overall consciensiousness, his ambitions for himself and his abilities (genetic abilities and propensities). I always loved to challenge myself to be/do better.....to see how far I could stretch myself.  The rewards are a greater appreciation of life's many gifts and oppurtunities.  We are, afterall, social, learning, goal seeking animals. Maybe a large part of the reason I always like to stretch myself to my outermost edges is that I believe that my genetic encoding forces me to find extra stimulation to feel at peace in my own skin.  Boredom makes me feel anxiety.  Maybe that's why my parents kept me on a tight, heavily booked schedule.  I needed it maintain my equilibrium.<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2009 at 3:20 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Both Christine B and 'learning as I go' mention something which I consider quite important: Education about time management or being organised in general.<br><br>Formal education, as we all know, comes during a person's early years. It's a shame that we teach our children about reading, writing and arithmetic, but not also how to organise themselves. We miss the opportunity to do so at that early age when children are excellent at receiving and _accepting_ advice.<br><br>@learning as I go<br>My above comment about creative people was not meant to disparage them. It's a general observation, based on my experience, and of course subject to many exceptions. For example, laig, you mention that you were "taught how to PLAN and follow a schedule..." which I guess must have helped your innate conscientiousness and ambition to succeed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2009 at 4:57 | Otto Fox</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Otto,<br><br>Add to your list that we don't teach children how to learn.  In fact, we teach them almost no tools at all.  Remember being told that by tomorrow you would have to memorize and recite "Trees" in class.  Did anyone tell you HOW to memorize a poem?  <br><br>It is much the same with arithmetic.  There are sensible ways to do arithmetic other than memorizing tables.  Ways that have built in checking to determine that you did it right ... other than doing it over.<br><br>We seem to have it very wrong in education.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2009 at 5:24 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>I think what you say is true, though it obviously varies from school to school. The overall culture of the school is important too. I gave a talk recently to some students, and they were very interested, but none of them took any notes at all. When I asked why, I was told it was "uncool" to take notes and their friends would laugh at them if they did. <br><br>At the other extreme, I gave another talk to a very different set of students, and most of them seemed to be intent on writing everything I said word for word on their laptops. <br><br>I don't think either of those are very effective note taking strategies!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2009 at 11:34 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>P.S.<br><br>What *is* the best way of learning a poem?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2009 at 12:23 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Kids here in Canada are started off with an agenda / daytimer for school when they start grade 1.  It has homework due, what to study that night etc.  The parents are expected to sign off on it every day - it seems to be a good method to get them started in basic time management.  <br><br>I started using a daytimer in my early 20's when going to University and would schedule everything in there.  There isn't a lot of other demands on your time at that age and usually you're more spontaneous and not necessarily working towards any kind of goals and don't have multiple priorities to juggle.  <br><br>I started becoming interested in self-development and time management in my late 20's and early 30's because I realized there were a lot of dreams I had had for my life that would never be achieved if I didn't work at them in a concerted way.  That's when I started scheduling all of my time and started working on my goals using a variety of methods.  Unfortunately, I was quite rigid and easily discouraged if things didn't work out exactly as planned - so at that age, I hadn't learned yet to be flexible.<br><br>In your 30's is when most people's careers are their focus, so they need something to manage that.  But it seems most people I know don't manage much outside of their work lives apart from reminders of when to show up at events.  Most of my friends are in their 30's and I hear a lot of "call me and remind me".   Most people I've worked with in the last 10 years have been in this age group as well and they don't seem to manage their time using any method other than writing down or putting in their computer deadline dates.  I have worked quite a lot with engineers though, and they appear to be the exception.  <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 May 2009 at 13:30 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>Yes, I agree that it does depend on the school.  I had lunch with a teacher who was moving to a new school.  He was shocked at the rigid discipline ... it seemed to him that it would be an awful environment ... it was almost militaristic.  But then he taught a "test" class for his job interview, and was surprised at how attentive the kids were.  They focused on what he was saying and tracked him has we walked around the room.  They had their notes out and were paying attention.  So he started to think seriously about the efficacy of stern discipline.  I guess it depends on a lot of things working together.<br><br>Re: Poem.  I'm certainly no memory expert (nor do I play one on TV ;-)  If I were to set up such a thing I would start in the earliest years and "teach" the laws of memory ... not as a lesson but as a game.  I'd have kids try to remember a short list of things then show them a better way.  I'd use one "law" at a time.  Probably I'd start with exaggeration.  "How can we remember 'shoe'?  Suppose we imagine a big shoe, one 10 times the size of a house?"  Each day I'd do a little more, just as a game.  Then I'd start applying it to what they were studying.  "How can you remember that Colombus discovered America?  (Assuming you have to teach that myth! ;-)  Can you see a big ship landing on America and there all these Indians waiting then a gigantic yellow school BUS drives off the ship?  What kind of bus?  A school bus?  NO!  It's actually a COLOMBUS!"  Something along those lines.  I'm sure if I actually had to do it I'd come up with something better ;-)<br><br>As to memorizing a poem, I don't know the "best" way, but any way is better than telling the kid they have to come in tomorrow with it memorized!  I would start by explaining the poem ... I think it is easier to memorize what makes sense.  Personally, I'd start at the end and work backward to the beginning.  I'd learn it one line at a time.  But first I'd identify "trigger" words for each line ... especially the rhyming words.  Once you know those you have it mostly beat.<br><br>One thing I'd be sure to do is use all sensory channels.  I'd read it, say it out loud, write it out, etc.  Then when I though I had it, I'd "perform" it.  IOW, poetry is an art ... it is meant to come alive.  There are rhythms and cadences to play with.  All of this helps and taken together removes the boredom of repetitive learning, if nothing else.<br><br>I have more experience with NOT learning things as I was awful in school.  I'd be tagged as having ADHD, in today's schools ... but in my day they called me a "problem".  Oh well.  But at least I know what does not work.  I only really got my memory under control when in my 20's I took a memory course and found that there was a system to these things ... it was not just a matter of repeating things over and over until you went mad.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 12:09 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>One very odd thing I've found about learning poems is that it's actually easier to learn ones which are in a foreign language. Possibly it's because in one's own language one is aware of thousands of possible variations, and in a foreign language one has to stick to what one knows!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 17:17 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Perhaps that's why I've never forgotten "Frere Jacques"!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 17:28 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>.... and it's not even necessary to know what it means!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 May 2009 at 17:29 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Regarding age differences, and RE education methodologies, maybe it would be good, for "problem" students like Mike :-), to use a totally different methodology, maybe Autofocus, for example.<br><br>E.g., teach the Autofocus method.  Then start adding in some of the school assignments.  Then let the kid go work his list.  Let them have some independence to go where their intuition and desires take them, and also to learn the material, but with guidance and help from the teachers.  Have regularly scheduled 1:1 (or X:1, small group) meetings with the teacher, to discuss questions about the subject matter, but also to discuss why certain tasks or subjects tend to get "dismissed".  Perhaps the psychological insights that many of us have had using Autofocus would arise, for both student and teacher.<br><br>Even if it's not practical for public schools, maybe it would work well for homeschools.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 May 2009 at 23:49 | Seraphim</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
