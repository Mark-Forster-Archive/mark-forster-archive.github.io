What's holding these back, and what strategies do you use for moving them forward?<br><br>Obviously, some could be tasks you really don't need  to do soon, and could be dismissed.<br><br>I noticed some that need to be done at another time or place.  I think an appropriate remedy is two separate preactions:<br>1) figure out when and where you will work on it<br>2) plan to get to that when and where.<br>Each of those counts to move the task out of the closed list.<br><br>I'm sure you have other reasons for stuck tasks, and other remedies.  Please share.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 November 2009 at 14:09 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have been looking at some of my 'stuck tasks' and decided that some of them are too big and that's why I'm building up resistance to them.  I know that the rules say that you only have to work on a task for as long as you want but I'm still resisting these.<br><br>So, I'm just about to break some of these tasks down into mini-tasks that are hopefully too small to resisit!  For me these are mostly household tasks:<br><br>so "clean bathrom" will become "clean sink and surround", "clean bath", etc<br><br>but I think this might help for any types of tasks.  Of course, once I've got the kit out and done the sink I might decide to get the whole lot done - that's fine - and if I don't, that's fine too.<br><br>Feels like a very trite example but all these things need to be done!<br><br>Lucy</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 November 2009 at 14:58 | Lucy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>All you need to do is decide how to start.  Write that down, and either do that on the spot or the next time you come around you should be prepared to start.  If you finish the start and get stuck, figure out what's next and write that.  IOW, when you cross off the task and reenter it, reenter it with the new next action.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 November 2009 at 16:21 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Lucy, your problem got me out of lurk-mode here, as I had exactly the same resistance to household must-do tasks. My solution is to remove the verb at the beginning of the sentence, so I no longer write clean/tidy/dust/etc, I simply write down the room, or the object in question e.g. freezer, oven. It is purely psychological, but I feel as though I have a freer rein to choose what I want to clean first. Then I add the room or object to the end of the list for another session later if needed.<br>After reading over what I've written I realise that it sounds ridiculous, but all I can say is that it works for me. I hate taking orders even from myself, it appears!<br>Clara</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 November 2009 at 18:38 | clara</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi all<br>Everyday I have 2hours timeboxed for the lousiest and/or most important stuff I don't particularly enjoy doing.  I assume only  about 1 1/2 hours actual productivity in that time with 1/2 break time.  I use my timer as launches.  The default setting is 15 minutes but I'll go as low as 5minutes or as high as 30 minutes.  I first choose the one that will bring me the greatest peace of mind to get out of the way followed by the other stuff.  The timer method is primarily to launch me to work and also provides a safety net to stop if it's as lousy as I originally predicted.  lol !  Usually I limit myself to ONLY 1 1/2 hours of lousy jobs.  After they're done, I'm free to pursue the work I like much more!  It's not fun but it gets it out of the way early in the day.  The rest of the day seems like clear sailing in comparison!

I know it's not AF, but I do prioritize my 1 1/2 hours worth of lousy work in order of both peace of mind and importance.  That way I won't make the mistake of suffering through unnecessary busy work.  It forces me to choose well.  I've discovered that in terms of work I don't like, it makes perfect sense not to do more of it than is absolutely necessary.  It took me awhile to get good at choosing and realize the benefits of getting it over with ASAP.  It really frees up my mind.  It's a time-based version of a closed list!  When I've clocked in my 1 1/2 hours, I STOP!  This will keep it from ever becoming urgent work unless of course, something new and lousy and urgent comes in!  LOL!  That's actually a fairly rare occurance.  Most of new work isn't  urgent,same day work. <br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 November 2009 at 5:02 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Clara,<br><br>It does not sound silly at all.

There are various laws of diminishing returns and such involved, but generally speaking, it takes X minutes to vacuum a room.  Within reason it does not matter if you vacuum once a day or once a month or once a year ;-)  If you have guests over every day then you might want to do it more often for that reason, but if not ... unless the dust bunnies are out of control and fighting all night keeping you up, then why not vacuum 1/2 as often or 1/4 as often and recoup that time for better things?  I mean, at the end, what will you regret the most ... the creative work not done or the vacuuming not done?  LOL ;-)<br><br>It is a balance.  Bathrooms and kitchens do turn on you more quickly than living rooms, for example.  And if I let the filing get too far behind, I start loosing efficiency.  And if I don't keep my time management system up to the second, then all is lost ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  It took me awhile to get good at choosing and realize the benefits of getting it over with ASAP.

And there's something marvellous about the way they look and smell when they've been blitzed - all those hard surfaces gleaming together.
