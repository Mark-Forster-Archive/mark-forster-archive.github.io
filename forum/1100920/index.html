I am not very disciplined about opening my mail everyday and usually end up with a pile to get through - and sometimes some unpleasant surprises because I havent' dealt with things in a timely manner. My bills are mostly paid by direct debit so no real worries there though.<br><br>I wonder if any kind souls can outline their approach to dealing with this, filing it and so on. I feel the need to change some habits in this area of my life - I keep thinking I haven't time to deal with it, but obviously I have to!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2010 at 19:52 | Alison R</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison,<br><br>I too had that problem.  I did several things to combat the problem.  First I too pay as much as possible online and receive as many ebills as possible.  I have also switched to paperless for as many bank and brokerage accounts as possible.  Most places save for you online statements for your access.<br><br>As far as the remaining paper goes, I realized I needed to access things, but that precisely filing items and lots of categories was a waste of time and I would not keep it up.  <br><br>So, I now use expanding files. A few categories go a long way  For example at the start of each new year I make an expanding file called Paid Bill/Tax Info 2010.  When receive a paper bill and pay it the bill is thrown in the file.  Any charitable donation, or bill I pay which is deductible (property taxes, car registration etc) is put in the file but clipped together with a binder clip.  Paycheck stubs are put there.  When the year closes, I start to get tax stuff like W-2, interest statements etc.  All thrown in.  So nothing is precisely filed, but is grouped in this one file.  I can get ready for my accountant in less than one hour to do my tax return just by using this method.   When I get the tax return back, he gives me the backup and I just throw the envelope in a filing cabinet knowing I know have all of the important year end statements and bills in one place.  Maybe twice I have had to find something.<br><br> If I need to hunt a few minutes in the expandable file for something, the time is always less than what I would have spent precisely filing all of the vendors and categories.  This one folder has saved me hours a year.<br><br>I use only a few other folders Medical Claims by year 2010 and insurance policies, investment information and major purchases, where I keep receipts for stuff I buy like computers, TVs etc.  These are not by year, as I occasionally purge old stuff out<br><br>I wrote about this method in one of the free ebooks if you would like to read about it more.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 May 2010 at 21:35 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alison<br>One of the most useful paperwork fixes I did was to get a simple A4 file folder and label it 'Receipts, Guarantees and Instruction Booklets'. Inside I put 30 clear plastic inserts and labelled them 1-30. On the inside cover of the folder I stuck an index page listing the contents.  Here's a sample of the categories in my file:<br>1 Fridge/Freezer<br>2. Oven/hob<br>3. Dishwasher<br>...<br>7. Vacuum cleaner<br>8. Iron <br>9. TV<br>10. DVD player<br>...<br>15. Camera<br>16. Landline phone<br>17. Mobile phone<br>...<br>22. Gifts<br>23. Leisure equipment<br>24. Electric heaters<br>25. Furniture<br><br>Receipts of purchase, guarantee slips and instruction manuals for when things stop working are now in one place and easy to find. There's no special filing equipment to buy and the system can easily be expanded by adding new categories as needed. So when, for example, the washing machine packs up I know exactly where to go look for the paperwork.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2010 at 9:59 | Linda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I open my mail and drop the content in three folders in my inbox<br>red: bills and paperwork (to be handled within week)<br>orange: open stuff<br>green: paid bills and paperwork to be archived<br><br>this gives a three step method: <br>1 open the mail at reception<br>2 handle the urgent (within the week)<br>3 archive (whenever you feel like it)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2010 at 10:34 | Damien</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If the filing aspect of paper is what has you resisting opening your mail/bills, make it as simple as possible.  The description of what I do (below) makes it seem complicated.  It isn't.  <br><br>For receipts, guarantees, and instruction books, I file them all together similar to Linda.  But I don't organize within the folder(s).  Every year or three I might go through the folders and purge stuff we no longer have.  Usually I only do that when I go to look for something.  If there is something like an instruction book that you refer to periodically, that could go into a separate folder for easy access once you realize the need.<br><br>The exception to the above is info related to major appliances that I might not take with me when I move.  That info goes into a separate accordion folder with a labeled slot for each item.  It will stay with the house.  In fact it is the folder that I got from the original owner of our house. <br><br>For paid bills, etc., I've got 3 places that capture almost everything:  Stuff I need for taxes goes in one folder;  Medical in a second; and everything else into an accordion file by month.  <br><br>With the catch-all accordion folder, I don't worry about the dates much - if today is May, stuff filed today goes into the May slot.  So if I end up with a pile that I didn't file right away, I don't really ever sort it out to put it under the right month.  Last years stuff gets purged when I need to start using a month's slot for this year's stuff.  That gives me one more chance to re-file it where needed if I have missed something important.  Otherwise it ends up in the shred box.  I almost never have to go through and find something, so there isn't a real advantage to a fancy file system for this stuff.<br><br>I think some folks simplify the accordion folder idea even further:  One box per year.  Shred when it gets to a certain age.  A copier paper box is about the right size.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 May 2010 at 13:44 | MartyH</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
