For example: I have used AF to do all of the tasks leading up to painting the room, or grouting the floor.  These next tasks cannot be done properly in a little and often manner, each is a commitment of at least a few hours to get to a stopping point.  <br><br>Now I am experiencing quite a bit of resistance due to the size of the tasks and it’s not something that I particularly want to do anyway.  Other than the ‘just suck it up and do it’ approach, have any of you any advice on a better way to proceed for now and in the future?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 March 2010 at 12:09 | Tuck</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Tuck:<br><br>I would suggests that you use timed bursts here.<br><br>Set an alarm for 5 minutes, work until the alarm goes off, then do something else for 5 minutes then reset the alarm for 10 minutes, then 15, 20 etc. Take 5 minutes break between each burst. You can do anything during the break except work on the project. <br><br>It's important with this timed burst method, that you keep the bursts exact. Don't run over on either the work or rest phases.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 March 2010 at 13:27 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;Other than the ‘just suck it up and do it’ approach&gt;&gt;<br><br>Actually, that's about the best approach. You can try Mark's timed bursts approach if you like, but I'm not sure it works for something like painting a room.<br><br>Another of Mark's suggestions which is useful is the 'Just Get The File Out' approach (which conveniently is also, in accronym form, nearly synonymous with 'Just Get The F. On with it'). Rather than have 'paint the room' on your list, have 'put dust sheets out', or 'mix paint for room'. Anything which is a more 'do-able' first step. Then just trust that your natural 'completion urge' will take over at that point.<br><br>Even if you consciously 'know' that you will do the whole job, telling yourself you'll just do the smaller first step (sometimes I even tell myself out loud), somehow fools part of your mind enough to get started.<br><br>Failing that, you could always pay for a decorator, or find a friend who actually likes decorating, since it's fairly clear that you don't!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 March 2010 at 14:10 | Ed C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would add to Mark's advice to redirect your thinking. If you think, "What a long miserable job this will be" or "I will probably get drips everywhere" and the like it's no wonder you're resisting. Think purposely things like, "I can listen to a good book on tape while I work" or "I'm looking forward to showing this newly painted room off" or "Once I start, I will be eager to continue. I can also choose to stop before I am through."<br><br>Heck I am motivated to paint for you now!

I do see how it would make painting symbolic of a lot more. I hope you can separate the task from the situation in your mind and move past the regret (difficult as that may be). Please post when you get the ball rolling so we can encourage you. Thanks for sharing as I'm sure it will help someone else.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 March 2010 at 22:27 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Tuck, <br><br>As Mel has highlighted, some tasks carry a lot of negative baggage with them. It sounds like this is one of those situations. <br><br>Would it be a helpful suggestion to attach a small tangible reward ( eg a movie or a take away meal, etc.) to a specific outcome / end result, to increase motivation?<br><br>I've always found it useful with these sort of projects to estimate the time involvement (be generous!) and then to do the project in 30 min time boxes with short breaks in between. It then becomes more of a game and helps keep me on track.  <br><br>It's not nice, having to do tasks that carry negative feelings, or that one has simply no interest in. <br><br>The best of luck to you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2010 at 8:12 | Leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>With tasks like these I find it helpful to do a trial run on a smaller area that's least critical. <br><br>Then use the experience gained to come back to do more later on, with a better technique and idea of the time required.<br><br>A quick search of web forums can yield good advice.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2010 at 9:23 | smileypete</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I did mention paying for a decorator, and I'm sorry that isn't an option for you. But I also mentioned getting some friends in. Some people actually like doing this kind of thing (odd, I know!). And even if they're not avid decorators, it's definately going to be more fun with some friends/family over to lend a hand - pay with a few beers and a curry when you're done. You might actually enjoy the day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2010 at 11:28 | Ed C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ed, that's a fantastic idea. I am so glad you suggested it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2010 at 14:42 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Everyone<br><br>I used your suggestions (except for the friendship help-- I will send emails shortly) starting yesterday to prepare everything needed for completing these several projects--I wasn't as prepared as I thought.  Then this morning, I began grouting the kitchen floor at 5:15.  It is half finished due to several of your comments and small bursts to get me going.  It's not nearly as bad as I thought (rarely is).<br><br>Here's something interesting.  I have a chronic spine condition and was on crutches for 2 separate weeks at the beginning of the year.  Around the same time, I began using Mark's methods and reading the forum.  Due in part to this, I have been able to be consistant with my physical therapy and my back is quite healthier than a couple of months ago.  I don't see how I could have done the kind of 'on your hands and knees' work if I hadn't overcome the resistance to stick with the doctors program.  Maybe I'm over dramatizing this, but it feels significant at the moment.<br><br>The reason that the "Just do it" motto doesn't work for me is that I can "just do" anything that I have a desire to do or that is easy for me--I always get those things done and on time.  What I want from an Attention Management system is a way to help me lessen the resistance I feel on the things I must do and learn to have many less things that I give my committments to.  It seems that I may be improving.<br><br>Lastly, it is more encouraging than you know to have everyone giving such an abundance of support.  Thank you.<br><br>Sorry for the lengthy post Norman.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2010 at 16:05 | Tuck</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey Tuck,<br><br>Don't be afraid to ask for help on your project.  Sometimes we feel like we're imposing on people, but I think it's good to give people the opportunity to help us out.  A few years ago, I painted and tiled most of a friend's basement on a couple of weekends putting in 14 hour days.  I think I got a $25 dinner out of it, but it felt very good to help her out with a job she was intimidated by.<br><br>I think your comment on too many commitments and the relationship to resistance is key.  It seems that the less you feel obligated to do tons of things, the more mental energy / effort you free up for when you DO have to give yourself a little push to get things done.  It's the constant pushing that wears us down, not the occasional challenge.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2010 at 16:36 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Also, consider that when you look at YOUR task it can seem insurmountable but when you look at the same task confronting another person, it can seem simple.  Two action plans flow from this single observations:<br><br>1) Ask for help, as suggested.  Since it is YOUR problem, other people will have no baggage and will love to help and will gain a sense of satisfaction from it.  They will also feel motivated to tackle some of their own baggage laden dragons. (My, now that really is an analogy run amok.  ;-)  Part of this is perfectionism.  You would agonize over doing just the perfect job.  They would just paint the damn wall and be done with it ... it is not THEIRS after all.  And you know, once it is done, you'll probably barely notice the slight "imperfections" in the job they did.  More likely, you'll move on and be glad it is all over.  Even if you did, you'd be too well-mannered to criticize.<br><br>2) Role Playing:  When I've been stuck and immobilized I've found success in imagining that I am helping someone else.  This is not a new idea by any means, but a good one to keep in your pocket.  (Damn, another nutty analogy ;-)  I think Mark even uses this one in his GED book, IIRC ... Lakein certainly does.  You just engage in a bit of MPD, put on your "hired help" hat, and come to work for yourself to fix the mess.  The emotional distance this creates is often enough for you to see your way out of the box and get moving.<br><br>"O.K.  I've been hied to paint this room.  No problem.  This silly twit wants me to do the whole thing by myself.  Screw that.  I'm holding a painting party.  YAY!  Paint ... paint ... paint.  Pass the beer."  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2010 at 20:08 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Funny you mention the role-playing. I have been seriously considering writing myself an email asking for advice with some difficulties I'm having. I can easily figure out other people's problems, but my own are just so complicated, ya know. lol I think Norman or the blogger someone linked to is right about the denial of reality being the problem. I know that the solution to my problems are X and Y, but that requires a lot of effort. I keep hoping that there's an easier way. lol</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2010 at 21:18 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You said a mouthful just then ;-)  It really is about reality.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 March 2010 at 21:30 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel:<br><br>"I think Norman or the blogger someone linked to is right"<br><br>Fixed:<br><br>"I think Norman is right full-stop."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2010 at 1:42 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman,<br><br>You crack me up.  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2010 at 8:08 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel,<br><br>Half the time I move to post a question on a forum (not just here), by the time I've figured out how to express the problem and type it in, and explain why the obvious solutions don't work, ... then I discover I've got a solution and don't need to post the problem at all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2010 at 12:07 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan, yeah, I know what you mean. That's why the most common number of sessions with a therapist (at least in the US) is one. Just expressing what the problems are can be the cure. <br><br>Norman, well, I don't know that I can revise my comments that much, but I can use one of my late father's favorite expressions--I'm really glad you got to chat with me. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2010 at 13:54 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel,<br><br>That is one explanation ... the other is that after one session the client gets disgusted and wanders off in search of a better therapist.  I guess it's hard to get that kind of information because in both cases people are dropping out and in the second case, the therapist has no interest in knowing they have not been helpful.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2010 at 17:25 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, that does happen. But as the first session is almost always just information collecting, it's less likely that the quality of the therapist is at issue. The research that shows that you don't have to be trained in psychotherapy to be seen as effective with milder problems also suggests that many people just want someone to listen to them. Of course, they don't realize that this is the gist of what they want or they could buy their pal a beer to zip it for an hour and they'd get the same result. lol</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2010 at 1:51 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel,<br><br>Said it before no one is righter than you other than me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2010 at 6:21 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman, what about Mark?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2010 at 13:50 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>He is beyond such concepts.
