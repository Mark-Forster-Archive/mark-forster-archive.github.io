I work out of my home (contractor and self-employed) and have a HUGE problem with procrastination.  I have been searching for years for a system which would help me be productive on a regular basis (it's mostly been hit and miss for me for years).  I don't remember how I found Mark Forster, but I've been getting his newsletter for a couple of years now.  <br><br>At the time when Mark sent his request for Beta testers for AutoFocus, I was about at the end of my rope.  I was starting to feel as if I should get a "regular job" because I just wasn't able to stay focused enough to make any self-employed ventures all that successful.  Fortunately, I'm married and not destined to be on the street, but I DO want to feel successful both in my personal and professional life.  <br><br>Enter AutoFocus... I have been more productive in the past 2 weeks than at any other time in many years!  I am SO thrilled with this system overall.  I tend to be stubborn and rebellious and the system accommodates that.  I find that I DO want to get things done but I don't like being told what to do, even by myself!  Not only do I not like working for other people, I don't really like working for myself, either, I guess - LOL!   <br><br>I do have a few questions and comments, however.  I appreciate any feedback...<br><br>1) Mark mentioned you should be getting through all of your active pages several times per day.  I never even get through them all ONCE.  I work on things which jump out at me and for as long as I feel like and sometimes that is several hours on a task.  I have a lot of project work (I do web design) that can be quite engaging once one gets going.  This is fine, but sometimes I have other things which need to get done (such as replying to email or returning phone calls in a timely fashion) and I find I am delinquent on those items.<br><br>2) The amendment of listing urgent items on an index card or post-it is helping, but that kind of feels like my old "to do list" and I'm feeling a bit resistent.  I'm wondering if I need to be more selective with what goes on that list.  I think it should only be ABSOLUTE musts, not "shoulds."  <br><br>3) I have some reservations about "little and often" because I feel that task switching isn't productive.  After all, it takes some time and momentum to get started on certain tasks.  For things on which I've been procrastinating, I can see the value.  Those 5 or 10 minutes here and there will add up and eventually the task will be completed.  But I think it's okay to work for a few hours on a task if one feels compelled to do so.  <br><br>4) Mark mentioned having structured work hours during which we use AF.  But do others use it all the time?  What I do is use it during my "regular work day" (which isn't always the same, but I know when it is work time) and then use a looser approach at other times.  For example, I didn't "work" per se yesterday but did do some of the items on my list because I felt like it and it made sense at the time.  But I didn't go through the pages one by one like usual.  I was still happy to cross items off my list.<br><br>5) I find that with AF, I WANT to start working each day and don't lag as much in the mornings.  I allowed myself to slack on Saturday and was unhappy with this. I feel raring to go each day.  To me, this is nothing short of a miracle!<br><br>Thank you, Mark, and thanks to all of you for your valuable feedback!  I am sure I will post again, but it has to be on my list :-)  <br><br>Kind regards,<br>Debbie</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 20:16 | Debbie R.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Debbie:<br><br>Thanks for your detailed posting, and I'm delighted that it's going so well for you so far.<br><br>In answer to your questions, as long as the system is working for you then it really doesn't matter how long you work on a particular item or how fast or slow you move through the list. If spending several hours on a project feels right for you, then do it - but remember you also have the option of only spending a few minutes on something.<br><br>I recommend keeping the index card/post-it only for items which MUST be done today. Otherwise, as you say, it just becomes a rival list. I seldom have more than two or three items on mine. It's also important to work on this short list in the same way you work on a full page, i.e. only doing the items when they 'stand out' for you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 21:11 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Thanks for your reply and for the recommendation about the index card.  I will make a rule to have no more than 3 items on the index card and see how that goes.  Today I had about 10 items on the card and that's most of what I've done so far today!   It may be because it's Monday...  I did spend a few minutes on a few items today (things on which I've been procrastinating) and I felt good to have made some headway on them, even if it was minor.  I resist crossing items off the list, but have done it quite a few times thus far.  I currently have 7 active pages and my average has been around 6-7 pages.  I think I will be able to knock out a few pages tomorrow or Wednesday.<br><br>I am very grateful to you for this system!  It works where other methods have failed for me thus far...  Rebels don't like rules, but somehow this system feels more fun and free-floating to me.  As long as I do SOMETHING on the list, I am okay.  I had read an article on structured procrastination before, but it was merely theoretical.  You managed to come up with a practical application and many people are benefitting from that.  Kudos to you!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 January 2009 at 23:30 | Debbie R.</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
