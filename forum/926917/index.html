Many of us have an implementation in other software and don't relish the idea of stating over just to try something new.  Starting over is a big impediment to your market penetration.<br><br>3) You need some kind of  backup.  This could be a simple export but I'm sure you can come up with something better.<br><br>4) You could easily draw the red line automatically if a subsequent pass of the closed list produces no action on any task.  But then you would need a way to delete the line so that someone could simply review the task list without triggering that action.  (Yeah, not strict AF4,  but what the hell?  ;-)<br><br>5) I second the requests for dates.  I would like to see a "task create date" and a "task completed date" added automatically, and the provision to allow at least one other date for a "task due date".  Possibly another for "task start date".  (All of this is not AF4, but useful).  For the optional date I would like them to not get in the way of your simple interface.  Perhaps a button to click to allow them to be entered if desired but left blank (and no form to fill) if they are not specifically requested. <br><br>6) Along with optional dates, optional tags or categories would be REALLY REALLY helpful.  The main reason I use software is so that I can filter tasks so that if I'm working in the yard, I can see all my yard tasks and nothing else.  (On paper I keep them in a separate list but electronically, I see tags as a better solution.)<br><br>7) Lower on the priority list for requests would be some control over appearance.  I.E. color for strike out, simpler strikeout (rather than the scribble over business you have now), font size and style, etc.<br><br>8) Along with the request for export, it would be nice to be able to control the format of the export.  This would allow exporting to a word processor or something that would allow printing for those who want to have a printed list.  (A much lower priority, of course.)<br><br>All in all, a very nice first cut.  I would be happy to test for you but I'm not sure I want to do all that is necessary to get binaries installed on the iPhone.  (I do realize the nonsense that Jobs has put in your way ;-)<br><br>Also, if you need anyone to clean up the English in your documentation, I would be glad to do that for you.

Your tutorial worked well.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  2) yes I know that most of you guys already using some app to manage your tasks. The tough task here is to understand what app is most popular. We will do that in the next versions.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Gotcha.  If I were you, I'd look at various applications and see what options they have for exporting tasks and see if there is some intermediate format that can be used.  For example: email, Excel, flat text file, etc.  I know that the user will have to do some fiddling, but since that is a one time thing, it is acceptable.  I realize how hard that can be, especially considering the restrictions iPhone places on all of this.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  3) GED already has a backup feature :) You can go to app settings and backup all your tasks to your email box. To restore just open that email on your iPhone and tap on restore link.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Super.  I did not see that.

Tags and categories are complex and not very easy to adapt. I tried tags in Things and was not able to create some meaningful tag hierarchy.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, I know how confusing that can be.  If nothing else, just add a couple of fields like: F1 and F2 which the user can sort and filter on.  Then what F1 means to me can be different than what it means to someone else ... but I'll be able to filter my tasks on it.  Of course, you'll all the ability to sort and filter (both) on due date, and such, right?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  7) We will do that. also I am thinking about different paper templates, colors, etc.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Sweeeeeet ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  8) I believe export to Excel should works fine. Excel has really nice analysis features.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I had not even thought of that ... the analysis angle.  I was just thinking of printing.  But some might like to do analysis.  Good idea.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  We made very detailed page how to install app while it in review.

I am not a native English guy, so I'll appreciate any help with this. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Your command of English is impressive.  English has pitfalls which non-native speakers fall into.  The problem is that those can be pervasive.  In the case of your documentation, it is mostly errors of "agreement" for want of a better term.  Plural terms have to agree, for example.  The only way I can describe it is that you have to develop an "ear" for the language.  I don't know what is right because of rules, though I can often cite the rule, but becuase it "hurts my ear" when I hear it.  That is why I offered to error check for you before you put documentation out there.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  And than you for you feedback.

Have you considered Excel?  I know you mentioned it elsewhere.  I suggest it because ListOmni uses Excel as its interface ... it is apparently a lot of work for anyone to make a desktop application.  I am sure text will work as you can import/export from Excel to text.  It would just be a tad simpler to use Excel as a desktop substitute.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  8) export<br>Why do you want to print something from app? How are you going to use those printed pages?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Nothing at all, actually.  I was just representing those who seem to need a printed copy to carry.

By all means, offer options for users to customize the look and feel of the app (as Mike suggests), but I think you have done a great job on this.<br><br>From an Autofocus point of view, I would love to see some kind of "tickler" mechanism built in to the app - with a repeating function, if possible. <br><br>Other than that, my only qualm is the use of in-app purchasing for additional notebook pages.

Also, I think you have to prepare yourself for a string of negative reviews from people will dowload the app for "Free" and then resent having to pay for refills. <br><br>Will give more feedback once I have been using the app for a little while more. <br><br>Trevor</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2009 at 12:35 | Trevor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Trevor,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Other than that, my only qualm is the use of in-app purchasing for additional notebook pages.

But would be a non-starter.  Do you really think that is Alex's pricing model?  I thought that he meant that there would be a "free version" for trial and then you could purchase an unlimited version for some small price ... maybe $0.99 or so ... which is the common price for iPhone applications.  I can't imagine that he plans to sell the application by the page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2009 at 12:57 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mike,<br><br>I only have the Ad Hoc version installed, so I can't say - at the moment - whether the finished version will have the same pricing model. There is a countdown setting in the settings which shows how many pages you have left - at the moment I have 91. When I click on the countdown there is the option to buy another 100 pages for $2.99. <br><br>As I said, I don't have a problem with the concept in principle, but I think there should be tiered pricing for the refill pages.  <br><br>Alex was kind enough to provide me with an Ad Hoc version with 100 pages to start, and I am down to 91 already. The app store version only has 5 pages to start according to Alex's post above, which I'm already convinced isn't enough to give people enough time with the app to decide whether it really is right for them.<br><br>Based on my limited use of the app so far, I am really enjoying it. However, if the pricing model isn't right, with plenty of choice and really generous refill bundles, I can see the app getting a lot of flak in the app store.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2009 at 14:30 | Trevor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Forget the 2.99 refill... the Gucci alligator skin was enough of a turn off for me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2009 at 14:57 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hey Trevor, Mike<br><br>Txh a lot for your feedback.<br><br>The pricing models is simple. Initially app is free. When you install it you have 5 pages in your organizer. I believe it would be enough to make some impression about app. When you run out of 5 free pages you have to buy 100 pages refill bundle for 2.99$. When you run out for your 100 pages, you have to buy refill bundle again.<br><br>Each page can have 8 tasks, so you buy 800 tasks for 2.99$. I am doing about ~10 tasks daily, so 100 pages will be enough for me for about 2.5 month. As for me 2.99$ for two month not a big money if app is really helpful. . I am paying more for BigMac that is really junk  But I am still expecting a lot of complaints about that.<br><br>What do you think? Is my math is wrong?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2009 at 16:34 | Alex</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Alex,<br><br>For what it's worth, I'm another person who's immediately turned off by both the pricing model, and the look of the app. <br><br>Pricing: Although it's true that, depending on one's usage, it might not be a lot of money in the grand scheme of things, it is a lot more money than one has to spend for similar apps (even if most of them aren't quite as well suited to AF). And quite apart from the money, there's the hassle factor of having to actually stop working one's list to purchase more pages every so often. <br><br>Look: Tastes vary, of course, but I'm quite put off by the alligator skin (like Avrum), the look of the pages themselves, and the choice of font. I wouldn't mention this if I didn't think that there are probably lots and lots of iPhone users like me – especially all the Mac users. The look of the app is very much at odds with the dominant Mac aesthetic, and that's surely taking a risk. Anyway, maybe it's superficial to disregard what maybe great function for reasons of form, but if so, it's clear from the blogs, reviews, etc., I read, that there are lots of similarly superficial people out there. I didn't even really explore the app once I'd seen how it looked (and this was before I knew about the pricing).

The pricing models is simple. Initially app is free. When you install it you have 5 pages in your organizer. I believe it would be enough to make some impression about app. When you run out of 5 free pages you have to buy 100 pages refill bundle for 2.99$. When you run out for your 100 pages, you have to buy refill bundle again.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Ooops.  That rules it out for me.  I would not even bother testing it given that marketing model.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Each page can have 8 tasks, so you buy 800 tasks for 2.99$. I am doing about ~10 tasks daily, so 100 pages will be enough for me for about 2.5 month. As for me 2.99$ for two month not a big money if app is really helpful. . I am paying more for BigMac that is really junk  But I am still expecting a lot of complaints about that.<br><br>What do you think? Is my math is wrong? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>It is not your math that is wrong.  What is wrong is the basic marketing model.  It is a basic rent vs. buy problem.  I'm a "buy" kind of guy ;-)  Once I decide I like something, I don't want to pay for it over and over.  Once is enough for me.  This is especially true of a software package.  There is really no justification for paying more than once for a product.  After all, once it is purchased, there is nothing more to buy.  What is the value added?  What is the justification for the nickle and dime approach?<br><br>If it is a question of buying bandwith, or storage space, or upgrades to the function of a software package ... then I can see it.  An ISP is giving me something for each payment I make.  The seller of backup services is maintaining a disk farm for me and keeping it running and backed up.  If I don't want new function in a product I don't have to buy it ... but the product will not STOP running.  In the model you have decided on (assuming your mind is made up) you are selling me something that will just stop working if I don't continually pay you ... pay you for what?  That is the question.  I guess it is bothersome because that question has no answer.<br><br>The other aspect is the old "Is this really too much to pay if it helps you?" challenge.  It is not new.  We are asked to "invest" in a product, not "buy" it ... by the sellers of encyclopedias and audio courses, with that technique.  The thing is, that kind of involves the seller of a product into my life in a way that repulses me.  I don't want someone measuring what things might be worth to me, in that way.  It may be, as you say, that I can get more than two months of use of a product for the price of a burger, but that is beside the point.  I don't compare burgers and software in that way.<br><br>The local health club here is selling their membership fee with the argument that it costs less than a Starbucks coffee every day.  So what?  What does coffee have to do with a gym membership?  Nothing.  It is just a marketing technique that confuses people when they can't figure out how to answer the question ... and while they are confused, the salesman slips a pen into their hands to sign on the dotted line.  LOL ;-)  The answer is really this:    Am I likely to stop drinking coffee now that I have the gym membership?  That is the basic flaw in the argument.  It is not a trade, it is an ADDITION.<br><br>I don't know if I explained it, but the whole idea of buying a product that is intentionally "broken", then paying someone to keep it running, is repugnant to me.  It feels a bit like extortion.  "Hey, you want to keep using your program?  Then pay Vinnie here every month.  Oh, and for just a bit more we'll make sure you don't have a fire."  LOL ;-)<br><br>Others may have a different view, of course.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 November 2009 at 23:58 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Martin,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  For what it's worth, I'm another person who's immediately turned off by both the pricing model, and the look of the app.   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I would probably not have given it quite the same look but it is not all THAT bad ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Pricing: Although it's true that, depending on one's usage, it might not be a lot of money in the grand scheme of things, it is a lot more money than one has to spend for similar apps (even if most of them aren't quite as well suited to AF). And quite apart from the money, there's the hassle factor of having to actually stop working one's list to purchase more pages every so often.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Exactly.  And what exactly IS the grand scheme of things?  ;-)  Personally, I am concerned that I'd start thinking about how to enter tasks "economically" and not as dictated by my personal context.  It just adds confusion.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Look: Tastes vary, of course, but I'm quite put off by the alligator skin (like Avrum), the look of the pages themselves, and the choice of font. I wouldn't mention this if I didn't think that there are probably lots and lots of iPhone users like me – especially all the Mac users. The look of the app is very much at odds with the dominant Mac aesthetic, and that's surely taking a risk.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, but all iPhone users are not Mac users, nor do they particularly care about "Mac aesthetic".<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Anyway, maybe it's superficial to disregard what maybe great function for reasons of form, but if so, it's clear from the blogs, reviews, etc., I read, that there are lots of similarly superficial people out there.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>LOL ;-) ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 November 2009 at 0:09 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  If you follow the AF notion of little and often, you could do 50 tasks (usually the same ones) in a day.

To make it work I’ll need to buy more and more, probably every week if I am writing a lot of text. I am thinking about that notebook’s manufacturers could probably make it with unlimited paper by delivering new refills every month to my door for free   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Well, a notebook is a physical thing.  The manufacturer is providing new paper each time and it costs him to do so.  He has to go out and cut down trees.  Software is ... well, soft ... it has no physical existence.  In the case of software it must be intentionally made to stop working to force a person to pay more money to have the function he has already paid for.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  2) I am not going to buy a car because then I would need to spend 30$ weekly for gas.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>As above, the car manufacturer is selllng you the car and you know it takes gas to run it.  The car manufacturer is not coming out every morning at disconnecting things to make the car stop running unless you pay HIM money not to.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  3) I am not going to buy any virtual goods like new weapon or shields in “World of Warcraft” because they are not real and I already bought game software.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, exactly ... if I understand what you are saying.  If the manufacturer breaks the software so you have to pay more, then that is a form of extortion, in my view.  (Unless you are saying that those things are upgrades of some kind.)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  All our points of view is just a matter of relation to how world is working right now. If rest of todo apps would charge for page/task/color/num of runs/anything else, we probably going to think that GED business model is quite right. If someone would sell cars with unlimited gas refill, we probably going to think that GED business model is wrong.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Two points there ...<br><br>1) What people do or don't do with who they sell things does not make things what they really are, <br><br>2) That said, if a business model works, then it is probably best to follow it rather than invent a new one.  While it is possible that you could come up with a ground breaking new business model that would amaze the world ;-) it is more likely that people would just turn on you and your product would not get off the ground.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway I am sure that I have to change how things are works.

Looking at what works in the iPhone market it seems to be:<br><br>- Provide a free app for people to evaluate.  The limited number of records is one way that is commonly used.  Nag screens or initialization delays are another then,<br><br>- Sell a fully functional application for some price.  What price?  It seems that this kind of application typically sells in the $0.99 to $1.99 range.  The ones that fetch more money have more function.<br><br>Also, it is worth considering that lower price points sell more units and so the overall income is more likely to be higher.  Oh, and one thing you don't want to do is get a negative buzz going.  The iPhone has a broad following and some of them are pretty nuts.  Once they get on your case they start talking it up and you end up fighting a bad image.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 November 2009 at 10:31 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Store in App already have "nice" price per 100 pages - it's 2.99$<br>... like buy new moleskine each half year :)   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, but two things worth noting:<br><br>1) it is not a notebook ... it is software.  The two are not the same, except in your mind, if you choose to make them the same.<br><br>2) I would never spend that kind of money on a blank book.

I think you should set a low price initially, perhaps $2.99 or less to draw in new users and hopefully get a few good reviews. Update the app frequently, and experiment with raising prices incrementally.<br><br>GED is showing up when I do a search of the app store, so I guess it must have been approved by Apple. I haven't downloaded it yet because I'm still using the Ad Hoc version. I think you need to simplify the promotional info and encourage people more clearly to watch the video on your website, which does a better job of explaining what GED does.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is nothing in your promotional info which says that people are going to have to pay for more pages when they reach their limit. I think that's a recipe for disaster, frankly, and &lt;b&gt;I would pull the app from the app store before any damage is done&lt;/b&gt;.<br><br>As I've said before, I really like the look and feel of GED, and would certainly consider paying for it at the right price.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 November 2009 at 14:24 | Trevor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"GED has a broader market than just current AF users.

(I appreciate that 40 would be a stretch on an iPhone.)<br><br>If you go through the AF4 example slides and count the number of times Mark selects a task, you will find that it is a lot more than 8 a day.<br><br>Do you have a filter for open tasks only? That would help with the number of tasks per page displayed. <br><br>I don't have an objection in principle to paying for usage rather than up front, but I think that you need to look at the pricing carefully. "standard" Autofocus uses an A4 refill with about 35 lines per page, 200 pages, 7000 tasks for around $2. <br><br>And you do need to think about the legal obligations of a service provider, which could be more stringent than those of a software provider.<br><br>Ed, Do what I do: use the &lt;End&gt; key, or just &lt;Page Down&gt;.

Especially as it usually makes some sort of sense. I do think in this case that equating a pay per use model with extortion is taking things a little far.

There is on my TV right now something called "Cats 101".  Love it ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Especially as it usually makes some sort of sense.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Well, that too.  ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I do think in this case that equating a pay per use model with extortion is taking things a little far. Even in jest.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Well, in case you've not noticed, political correctness is nowhere to be found in my makeup.  Quite the contrary, in fact.  But then again, have you noticed Rosie being politically correct?  LOL ;-)  We can learn a lot from our furry friends ;-)<br><br>As to taking exception to my choice of terms, I can't imagine it would raise any eyebrows.  But then again ... "Psssst, hey, you wanna keep working on your tasks?  Well, pay up or you're out of business!"  LOL ;-)<br><br>I can sympathize with Alex's circumstance.  I'm guessing he's a talented programmer and is looking to make a pile of loot ... so bought the iPhone SDK and went to work.  Now that he has a product, he is confronted with some hard reality ... a really nutty customer base.  I can tell you, *I* would never want to deal with iPhone users.  Sheeesh.  I was looking at the comments for one program (a TM program of some kind) and one comment was (I swear this is true):  "This game sucks.  I can't figure out how to play it."  ROTFLMAO.<br><br>If I were to guess, I suspect that there is very little money to be made in writing iPhone apps.  It all comes down to the expectations of the iPhone customer base.  Even FREE apps are showered with criticism.  I mean, talk about gift horses!  Who would even want to step into that crap?<br><br>Anyway, I'm watching with interest to see how Alex fares.  I wish him all the luck in the world.  I think he is going to need it ;-)<br><br>P.S.  As to the number of tasks per page .... some of us are getting older and do not cope well with small point size.  One thing I liked about the look of Alex's app is that it is easy to read.  That just shows how hard it is to please everyone.  In the end, you wind up making the whole damn thing configurable.  Might as well just give the SDK to the end user!  LOL ;-)<br><br>Say "hey" to Rosie for me.  Louise would wave at you but she is snoring right now ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 November 2009 at 2:08 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>There's nowt so tiresome as someone who likes the sound of his own voice.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 November 2009 at 2:52 | Trevor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike,<br><br>Rosie certainly sees herself as the gift that keeps on taking.

I'm not sure where people get off charging in the $50 range for an app.  When I see that price I don't even bother wasting time reading the description.  I'd love to see a breakdown of app price vs. total income.  I did see somewhere numbers to indicate that apps sell well if the price has been reduced.  No surprise there, and I'm sure that accounts for every second app being "on sale for a limited time only".  LOL ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  This is a friendly conversation which you are very welcome to join. Don't expect any us to change, though.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Hope springs eternal ;-)  There is a fascinating phenomenon one sees not only on the Internet, but more and more in public discourse lately.  It is the absolute intolerance of anyone who expresses an idea with which one disagrees.  I'm thinking of the (not so recent now) almost riots at various universities when someone was invited to speak who expressed a controversial point of view.  The irony, of course, is that a university is exactly the one place where one would go to hear controversial points of view.  And so it goes.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  You raise an interesting question, though. Being English, I have no accent (and I suspect that you are the same).  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>How very droll.  ROTFLMAO ;-)  Of course, classical RP is the world standard and so only deviation from that can be properly called an accent  ;-) ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Mike, who do you sound like?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I'm not sure I know that I sound like anyone in particular.  You'd have to as someone else as we are not good judges of our own speech.  I do know that I have a VERY slight Boston "flavor" to my pronunciation.  I picked that up from my father as I've never spent more than a couple of weeks in Boston ... or anywhere else in Mass.  I also speak rather quickly ... which is somewhat at odds with the general Northeastern modality.  Most of my tean and early adult years were spent in Los Angeles so that probably tended to flatten out any accent I might have picked up from my earlier years in the Northeast./ Mid-Atlantic area.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 November 2009 at 10:25 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leanrning,<br><br>A good lovely Monday morning to you ... and best wishes for a productive (and, dare I say it?, FUN week ahead ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Rosie's pix working her ToDo list is so cute that she's staying up for another month!

I agree with some that we should not be wondering how to use our tasks as economically as possible. If you'll browse through Mark's day with AF4, I think he made about 80 tasks or so that day. Granted, that's probably more than the average user, but that would basically mean it would cost $10 to use the app for a month. Would I pay $2.99 for unlimited tasks? I'm pretty sure I would. As for the trial version... 5 pages or 40 tasks really is not enough to "try" the system. Maybe it is for those who already now that AF works for them, but for those who don't, this is really not enough. At 25 pages (200 tasks), users will already be much closer at figuring out if it works for them or not.<br><br>2) I really do like the looks of the app as it is now. However it might be an idea to compliment this nice and warm "realistic" look with a minimalistic apple-style look so that people can choose between two very different styles to suit their taste.<br><br>Regards,<br>Tijl - who is still not sure whether he'll buy an iPod Touch, an iPhone with a plan, or nothing at all... :(</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 November 2009 at 0:05 | Tijl Kindt</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>must admit first up that I have not read all of the comments yet... so mine undoubtedly will duplicate what has already been said<br><br>great looking app... couple of comments/questions...<br><br>-- does the upgrade cost for unlimited pages auto default within the app to the local currency of the users iTunes Store ?<br>-- the page turning feature GUI... needs to reflect the actual graphic used on the page... displays rings of a ring binder on the left but the page flips upwards... as if tearing the pages out... therefore needs to be a horizontal motion... very annoying visually at the moment :-)<br>-- need to be able to double tap to be able to add a new item rather than having to hit the "+" button<br>-- need to be able to do the standard iPhone GUI of swiping over the entry to get a delete button for the deletion of an item... single tap for the selection (green highlight)... swipe to delete<br>-- I thought one was meant to be able to write below the "Closed" (red) line... if there is a closed line on a page the "+" adds a new page rather than a new item below the line... new to Autofocus so my idea of this could be totally screwed :-)<br>-- the auto function referred to in the forum could be added but as a preference/option under the settings<br>-- love the look of the app... the UI is great... except for the page turning direction<br><br>cheers from Oz</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 November 2009 at 4:29 | TrevorML</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
