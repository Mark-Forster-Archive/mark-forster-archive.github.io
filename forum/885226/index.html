Draw a line at the end of your Open List -- that is now your new Closed List.  All the highlighted items are now "dismissed".  Add a task to Review Dismissed Items.<br><br><br>Basically, the only difference is that, instead of being forced to decide something on them the first time you come to them when you cycle through the Closed List again, you just "put them on review" like you would in AF1, AF2, or AF3.<br><br>It's very AF1-like, it seems to me.<br><br>I'm guessing, Mark, that you already tried this, and maybe you felt that the "on review" method just wasn't effective enough.  The new AF4 method certainly does force you to take action.<br><br>But what I liked about the old method is it allows a task to "ripen" some more, and keeps it around in an easily available location so you can find it later if you want.<br><br><br>I would be quite willing to "dismiss" my Closed List by highlighting it for future review.  But since I know that, following AF4 rules, I'll be forced to either act, delete, copy forward, or copy to my Tickler, on every one of those items, I just keep cycling through.  Even just copying them all to my Tickler would be painful and time-consuming.  And even if I do copy them to my Tickler, they suddenly become harder to find.  I really liked AF1 because I could just leave them all in AF and would know exactly where to find them if I ever wanted to.<br><br>As a result, I keep cycling through, cycling through, whittling down that Closed List.  Meanwhile my Open List is 15 pages long and growing unmanageable.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 0:26 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello Seraphim,<br>I can see the appeal of your suggestion, and I don't think it would devastate the psychology of AF4, but I do think it would weaken it.<br>Yes, the forced decisions in AF4 are hard, but that is part of its power.  WHY are you cycling through, cycling through, and never deciding on these things?  I was in a similar situation this morning and finally the frustration of my growing 'open list' forces me to dismiss around 20 items over a similar number of pages.  Then, when I got to go back to them, I was forced to examine each one carefully KNOWING that I would not get to look at it again. A few I could dimiss entirely, but for meany I finally realised why my eyes had been gliding past them without even seriously considering doing them.  Then I reworded it, or broke it down into a few tasks or changed tack on it entirely.  and already I can feel myself drawn to them.  eg. For a few tasks, I had to write a protocol for a new procedure.  Not much fun.  But then I reworded it as "Create simple laminated document for XXX".  Now I think: "You mean I get to use my laminator!  Let me at that document!"  (We're silly creatures)<br>Sure, after going through my dismissed tasks my new open list was already over a page long, but I want to do some of them: well worth the concentrated focus it took.<br>Your suggestion just weakens the tension a little bit between wanting to close the open list and shrink the old closed list.  USE that tension for all it's worth.  It's one of the key things that stops AF from being a shopping list of to-dos.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 0:52 | Ben</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My thoughts are to follow the instructions except that after fully considering a task and NOT deciding to kill it and NOT deciding to add it to the Open list, to just leave it highlighted.  Those that are killed or added to the Open list are lined out, but those that are left remain available for review and could be left alone (identifiable by highlight, but no strikeout) or they could be added to a Someday/Maybe list of some sort.  <br><br>To me, that seems to be an option that is equally valid along with adding an item to the Open list or abandoning it.  It is just a variant of adding it to a reminder system in accordance with the rules.  I this case the reminder system is AutoFocus!<br><br>Now if it is too tempting to just breeze by all these highlighted tasks when they are considered according to the rules, then this will likely weaken the system as you noted.  But if you really consider each one properly and diligently, This might be OK.<br><br>It will be quite a while before I get to this point, at least on my home list (which is the only one I am working on this week), so I may find my own idea to be lousy when I have to put it into practice.  Right now, I am getting a lot done, so I am going back to my list!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 2:07 | MartyH</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ben and MartyH -- Thanks for the comments.  Very good insights.  <br><br>Yes, I agree that my suggestion would weaken the power of the AF4 highlighting process.  <br><br><br>Ben wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;WHY are you cycling through, cycling through, and never deciding on these things?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Absolutely the ONLY reason why I am even considering the idea of AF1-style dismissal, is the sheer number of tasks in my Closed List.  I haven't even dared to try to count them till now.  As of right now, there are 352 open tasks in the Closed List, spread across 48 pages.  That's after 6 full days of AF4, and many times cycling through.  When I started AF4, I probably had 1500+ tasks and 60-70 open pages.<br><br>While I'm at it, here are the metrics on my Open List:  I started the Open List on 9/4.  I have added 404 tasks, of which 144 are completed and 260 remain open.  These are spread across 11 pages.   That's about 67 new tasks generated every day.  <br><br>On my Closed List, I closed ~1200 tasks = ~200 tasks per day, and on my Open List, I closed 24 tasks per day, for a total of ~224 tasks per day.  <br><br>That's a good ratio of new opens vs closed -- actually better than I was expecting:  about 1 new task for every 3 or 4 closed tasks.  That bit is encouraging at least.  It means I may actually get through all this.  :-)<br><br>The problem is, I feel that I am slowing down as the Open List gets longer.  So, while it may seem I could finish off my Closed List with just a couple more days focused attention, realistically I think it may take twice that, or more.  And that's assuming I can keep functioning as my Open List continues to grow.<br><br>Sorry if my extra-long list keeps generating extraneous questions...  For me, it's pretty interesting, not just for my own productivity's sake, but for the sake of time management theory, and getting a better understanding of how and why the mechanics of Mark's systems actually work...  If AF can handle my constantly expanding list of tasks and interests, then it can handle most anything, I'd think.  :-)   Plus, the strain of all those tasks seems to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of each iteration of AF more quickly than might happen with a smaller list.  So, it does seem interesting from a theoretical point of view.  But maybe that's just me and my fascination with systems of all kinds (and not just TM systems).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 5:22 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim, I must confess your situation does sound difficult.<br>Marty's suggesting does seem like a good one (and I think completely within the rules).<br><br>Hopefully Mark will turn an eye to this one.  I am certainly not stretching things as much as you are!<br><br>Perhaps your name is sounding true: if my understanding of the seraphim as 'the firery ones': beings living among the flames!<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 6:53 | Ben</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt;As of right now, there are 352 open tasks in the Closed List, spread across 48 pages.

When I started AF4, I probably had 1500+ tasks and 60-70 open pages.&lt;&lt;<br><br>That sounds like pretty impressive progress to me! <br><br>Maybe you could just ADD an AF1-style dismissal rule until your closed list gets more manageable. That is, make it a rule that you have to close the oldest page EVERY time you cycle through the closed list. <br><br>It is overwhelming to have to decide about hundreds of tasks at one time, but eventually you have to decide something about each of them. Closing out one page at time sounds much more manageable, and you might still be able to close pages at the rate of 3-4 a day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 September 2009 at 11:06 | Jessica</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks again to everyone for your replies.<br><br>For now, I am just continuing to power-through.  I am finding myself skipping / skimming the first several pages of my Open List whenever I come to it, and spending a lot of time on the last page of the Open List (always chasing the end of it).  That allows me to deal with pressing issues throughout the day.<br><br>When the urgency and pressure of the day start to wind down, I find myself making a natural transition to working the Closed List again -- except on days like today where the urgency and pressure never wound down.  :-)<br><br>So, I think I'll just keep doing this till I finally close out my Closed List.  <br><br>In the meantime, the beginning of my Open List is turning into a set of moribund Middle Pages.  But that's OK.  I also had moribund Middle Pages with AF3 (AKA RAF).  But there is a huge difference between AF3 and AF4.  With AF4, I am actually spending a LOT more time closing out the backlog of earlier tasks, rather than giving them only 3-5% of my attention like I did with AF3.  Pretty amazing difference, given that the overall feel of my day hasn't changed at all -- same amount of urgent, pressing tasks.  I feel like I am just getting a lot more done, and the Tyranny of the Urgent has been tamed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 September 2009 at 0:55 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>How's your list coming, Seraphim?<br><br>I'm fascinated that you are able to cope at all with so many pages. How did you end up clearing that initial closed list? AF4 or another solution?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 September 2009 at 14:10 | Jessica</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jessica,<br><br>I had a rough week last week with lots of pressing urgent work.  I almost never left the Open List -- I just kept chasing the end of it without ever reaching it.  :-)<br><br>But when I finally got to the end and moved to the Closed List, I got LOTS of things done there and cut the pages in half (or better).  I can now get through a cycle of the Closed List in about 15 minutes, and the end is in sight.  I'll have to count up the open tasks there to see exactly how much progress I've made.<br><br>Meanwhile my Open List has grown to 22 pages, but almost all of them are 80-90% completed already.  <br><br>So, while I still haven't dismissed my original Closed List even once since started AF4, I can still say that this has been my best AF experience yet, the most productive, and the most responsive to both urgency and importance.  Maybe not exactly what Mark was envisioning, however...  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2009 at 19:13 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Meanwhile my Open List has grown to 22 pages, but almost all of them are 80-90% completed already.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>What do you mean there?

Different people's mileage may vary, but I think it has made me more effective.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 September 2009 at 23:07 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, Lawrence,<br><br>&lt;According to the "rules" once you've worked on an item and stopped, it is done.&gt;<br><br>I read this along the following lines. <br><br>If on average it takes 10 visits (= AF4 tasks) to complete a piece of work, I think Seraphim is saying that many of pieces of work have been through 9 tasks, so next time they will disappear, shortening his list. <br><br>Seraphim,<br><br>I found that the final review stage of my closed list pounced on me unexpectedly.

It is gone from the page.  The page is nearer to being closed out.  True, the item is probably rewritten at the end to be worked on again, but each "task" must be crossed off and be reborn.  So I was confused with the statement about 80% done.  In AF4 all tasks are binary, with respect to completion ... they are or are not.<br><br>Will ... but the context was about how many pages he had and how soon he would close out is pages.  It sounded as if one day, a whole bunch of things would close because they were 80% complete now.  It sounded as if he was describing an earlier version of AF ... which was why I asked.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 September 2009 at 12:21 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Will,<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I found that the final review stage of my closed list pounced on me unexpectedly.

I meant that if you look at all the items on my Open List, about 80% of them have already been crossed off, leaving only 20% of them as open tasks.  <br><br>In other words, although my Open List is 22 pages long (now 23 actually), most of the tasks written on those pages have already been crossed off.<br><br>In still yet other words, I've entered 1055 tasks on my Open List since starting AF4 on Sept 4th.

AH, I get you now.  Yeah.  The old AF1 page centric system did help get rid of those pages with all of the holes in them more quickly.  With a 20 line page you had only at most 20 cycles before the page had to close.  With AF4 it could be a good long time ... I guess it comes down to the number of passes equals the number of total items on the closed list before it must be closed out.  Of course, if you spend a long time caught in the open list, it could be even longer.<br><br>2.  No, clumsy writing on my part.
