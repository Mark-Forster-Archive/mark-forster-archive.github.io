Would you use a shopping list when you go shopping? Would you use a packing list when you are packing for the holidays? Would you make up a call list, if you were calling prospective clients?

I really like Mark's approach here,as explained in his several posts in that thread. Now to figure out how to completely assimilate his thoughts.<br><br>My fav quote:  &lt;&lt;Indeed that may well be the case [that you already know what the project requires], but the purpose of an action list is not to tell you what you don't already know, but to break the project down into steps so that that you get a lot of successes along the way. The effect is to give you many small(er) tasks within the main project so that you are less tempted to want to return to the main list.&gt;&gt;</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 October 2010 at 1:50 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+AJPM+<br><br>Alan,<br><br>&lt;&lt;The effect is to give you many small(er) tasks within the main project so that you are less tempted to want to return to the main list.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Oh! I totally missed that one! Good eye there, Alan, that looks very important.<br><br>Now about that previous post of yours...I thought about it for some time.<br><br>&lt;&lt;As for you, are you thinking AF1 and some of your pages are actually projects?&gt;&gt;<br><br>I do not think that is a good idea...unless you can move pages.  You see, AF1 works by making each and every page before the last one to be closed lists; now since projects would be open lists, you cannot insert them as pages in AF1 without ruining the whole thing.<br><br>To be honest, my previous incarnation of the Maintenance Checklist was using movable pages (that's why I have a Rollabind notebook: to try if that will work) so that, in AF4 fashion, you move whole checklists as individual items in the list.  I also included my project lists there.  Suffice to say, it became too complicated and I rejected it.<br><br>Of course, anyone else who would want to try it is free to do so.  I think Post-Its will be of much help.<br><br>Anyways, my idea had been to stick it all in AF, without cohesion of any sort.  I think I may have been too rash.  Lemme think about it.<br><br>&lt;&lt;As for your chcklists, keep them! If you insert a checklist directly into your AF list, why not?<br>You're done that page when a column of checks is completed and then reinsert the entire page later. Though some checklists I think are better handled through hard triggers. When XYZ happens, pull out the corresponding checklist.

I haven't done mine yet because I cannot visualize it in theory yet, so any tip how others do it would be really appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br><br>I'm still refining how I handle projects, but I'm getting closer.  What I'm doing is in line with what Mark's posted in the discussion under "Using Resistance as a Guide" and as quoted/referenced above.<br><br>A project starts as a grouping of related tasks, or as a goal which needs tasks defined. I add a page for the project, give it a name, and reference that name in AF.  Within that page I write anything I want to.<br><br>When I encounter a project in AF, I may look at its page, and then decide whether to work on it.  All of these count as "Working on a project".<br>	- Defining or rewriting its goal<br>	- Defining intermediate goals<br>	- Defining or refining tasks<br>	- Planning out how to achieve the project<br>	- (Most importantly) Working on any tasks.<br><br>As Mark says, any of the tasks may be put individually on the AF list, in addition to being on the project page, if I so choose.<br><br>This approach is very general, and can be used for other task groupings besides projects.  E.g., checklists.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 October 2010 at 16:33 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I do pretty much the same thing that Mark describes in the above-referenced discussion.  How I handle any given project depends on what needs to be done for that project as well as how I'm feeling about it at any given time.  For example, my current DWM list of 42 items contains (based on a very quick scan &amp; count) three or four items that could go under the project "dissertation".  I know there are also more than a handful of related tickler items waiting to cycle into the list when I get past a bunch of looming deadlines.  In that case, I never REALLY have just "dissertation" on my list.  But things like "sewing projects" or "house projects" definitely do either get listed as just the project name or as itemized tasks depending on how I'm feeling about them at the time/whether or not there are hard deadlines for them coming up.<br><br>(Which reminds me... I need to add to my list to get back to the contractor about the drywall work in the basement.)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 October 2010 at 16:49 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If I have a small project which needs to be done quickly, I might jot the tasks down on my DWM list in the order they occur to me, on +mo. I allow myself to do the tasks on a single day in any order when I am in "project" mode, rather than cycling through the whole list between tasks. The short break between time tomatoes has the effect of letting my inner wizard bring anything he's worried about to my attention.<br><br>This works particularly well with AF2.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 October 2010 at 11:34 | Will</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"time tomoatoes"!

If you have a system like AF that constantly has items for your projects on it, you do not need another list.  If you have projects you work on occasionally you may need a project list.  If you have a big or long project, it may require its own plan outside of AF or your system.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 October 2010 at 3:47 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>+AJPM+<br><br>Thank you Gerry.
