There have been several times when I simply haven't felt like using it - which I never felt with AF1 and only rarely with AF2.<br><br>You'll find a hint about the way the new system works in my latest blog post.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>31 August 2009 at 22:42 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting that Mark should mention the addictive nature of AF1, basically it is this "pull" factor which is what is keeping me using AF at this moment. I switched over from an Outlook/phone system a couple of weeks ago and the main reason is that constantly reviewing task lists means old work doesn't get ignored as it was too easy to do with my electronic system. <br><br>I have found though that I am missing the electronic efficiency as far as recurring items is concerned as I don't always remember to re-write the task, and they don't show up on the day like  they do with Outlook. Some sort of hybrid is looking like the best solution and that will probably be using AF1 to cycle through long standing work as urgent and recurring tasks will probably stay in Outlook.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 September 2009 at 6:18 | Ashak</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm getting so addicted to the new version that I actually got up early today to get moving on it.

I think this idea has got lost from the revised versions of Autofocus, and has made them less attractive to me. I think it is the closed list idea, along with the concept of dismissal which is really its partner, that is the most powerful contribution you have made. <br><br>Isaac</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 September 2009 at 11:51 | Isaac</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ashak,<br><br>Yeah, something like the task manager on a cell phone would be ideal ... or Google Tasks works nicely as well.  It will send you SMS when your task is due.<br><br>But if you want to stay with paper I find that a simple list of recurrent tasks works well.  Just make it such that you have to see it often.  A wild color or a note in your AF list to check the recurrent list works nicely.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 September 2009 at 12:09 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Isaak:<br><br>Yes, the new system puts emphasis back on both the closed list and dismissal (whatever name it goes by).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 September 2009 at 12:44 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Wow!

I know you say you need to try it out to see if it works, but if you posted about it here now you wouldn't have to make any promises about its efficacy. And you might benefit from further testers, people's ideas about how to develop it, etc.<br><br>Or that might really annoy you, I suppose!

Thanks for the suggestion about the list of recurrent tasks but I am trying to reduce the amount of places where I look for lists to as few as possible so Electronic version which I always have handy is what I will stick with for now.<br><br>I am very much looking forward to this new version of AF Mark is working on because the closed list and review update sounds like it will be much more natural for me personally.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 September 2009 at 14:38 | Ashak</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Ludlow:<br><br>One reason is that I want to keep the option up my sleeve that I might actually charge for this one.

Whilst I am finding RAF very effective for the new stuff (my house move items are tripping along very well as they are fairly immediate), I am now finding some issues with the middle and older pages as has been expressed elsewhere on posts, and to some lesser degree dismissal. I use tickler files and calendar reminders for less immediate things e.g. those with deadlines or due dates over 10 days, but there are still a number of items which are starting to get "stuck".<br><br>I am also I feel hankering a bit for the closed lists element that was part of DIT in a more formal way. Seraphin's post on Mike the Mechanic made me think more closely about this and how it might be applicable to those of us who don't have specific tasks to undertake on cars but like a little more structure around our to-do's and day. I'm thinking about my task diary again (and not just because it was a lovely book to use!), but trying to think about running it alongside my RAF list and dropping the electronic reminders and having all to-do's paper based as that is how I seem to work best. Just some observations to add to the mix.<br><br>@David - lack of patience - no not at all - wouldn't have noticed one bit!! Nice to have you back hope that all the commitments aren't grinding you down.<br><br>- Titch<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 September 2009 at 18:29 | titch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Titch:<br><br>I'm not sure how you'll like the new version, but it certainly has a strong closed list element, and removes most of the problems associated with the "middle and older" pages, while still allowing a fast reaction to urgent stuff.<br><br>Since you mentioned electronic versions, I'll mention here that it works perfectly well without actioned tasks being displayed.

You'll have a short actual list at the end which will be handled in Reverse Mode or AF2 manner, and the rest is one or many backlogs for which there will be different rules. Maybe you'll be allowed only one pass during which you have to decide, "do or dismiss"?<br><br>Rests to guess how and when you switch from one to the other. Most likely by adding a task like "clear backlog nr 5", and it stands out in the actual list, you jump to that chunk of your list? And jump back as soon as... hmm?<br><br>Actually, I am curious. RAF was a surprise, so RAF2 might be as well.<br><br>But this gives me an idea... Because I am using one notebook for everything, my AF lists ARE already chunks scattered throughout the book - 10 pages here, 12 pages there and so on. (I colorcode them on the edge to find them easily.) So, maybe I could make use of this constellation? Have to think about it...<br><br>Did I mention I am curious of RAF2? Oh yes, I did. :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 September 2009 at 9:26 | AndreasE</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I may have taken a left turn somewhere along the line but ...<br><br>I made the decision to categorize tasks in only two ways:<br><br>- Those I am committed to doing this week<br><br>- All others<br><br>I can choose to see the "all others" as a backlog but I simply put them all in the "someday/maybe" bucket.  After all, if I am not going to do them this week, what does it matter what I call them?  During my next weekly review, I go over that list, sort it out, and select those things that I will commit to doing during the next week.<br><br>This has had some dramatic effects:<br><br>- My list is very much smaller than it used to be (about 10 pages this morning) and so I get through the list much more quickly ... several times a day, in fact,<br><br>- I am much more focused because I don't have so many fantasies on the list.  I dismiss them right away so they don't get in my way,<br><br>- Not CALLING it a "backlog" helps me a great deal.  I don't even like the term.  And what does it mean?  There will always be more to do than there is time to do it in, so does that mean I'll always be "backlogged"?  That is not a helpful construct for me.  It represents a category of "quasi importance".  Things I need to do but am not willing to commit to doing, but I still feel I need to do them more than other things.  HUH?  That is a foggy way of looking at things, I've decided.<br><br>Moreover, in thinking about this, I noticed that all such descriptions end up referring to time in some way.  Things are important mostly with respect to when they will get done.  It seems, to me, simpler to make a binary decision ... will they get done now ... or NOT.  Rather than WHEN will they get done ... now, or a little later, or a little bit later than that, or a lot later or ...  I think this realization was triggered by that discussion about someone's new software that requires estimating a completion date.  I wondered why that felt so repulsive to me.  It was a schedule without a schedule ... daft!  Now I better understand why that approach is wrong.<br><br>I can't think of anything I've lost by taking this approach.  If I really do have more things I MUST do than I CAN do, calling it a backlog does not change that fact.  Recognizing what I WILL do is more pertinent than any other consideration.  So I wind up focusing on what I WILL do and dealing directly with that.<br><br>So basically AF is working to manage my time among tasks that I have decided that I really will do this week and, of course, continues to act as a grass catcher to collect junk that drifts on by. <br><br>As to the list "rules", I'm finding that it matters a lot less than it used to.  My list is so short now that it makes little difference if I'm working forward, backward, or cherry picking.  I tend to work from the end, but that may be more a matter of habit than anything else.<br><br>My dismissal rules have also morphed.  Now I continually look at tasks with the question: "Am I STILL really committed to doing this task this week?"  I'm still surprised how many times I get "NO!" for an answer.  Something changes, I guess, and the urgency or importance drops so I dismiss it right then and there.  It will probably go on again when I review in less than a week.  Or maybe something else will tickle me to put it back.<br><br>One more thing, I'm liking that suggestion of putting a "!" in front of tasks that are added back after being dismissed.  That really does serve to make me think about why I'm not doing it.  Why it is happier being moved from one list to another but not to be acted on.<br><br>Just some musings this morning ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 September 2009 at 10:31 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Titch:<br><br>&lt;&lt; which element does my post suggest that I will not like? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Although it strengthens the closed list element, it does not do so in the same way as DIT does.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 September 2009 at 12:39 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>&lt;&lt; I made the decision to categorize tasks in only two ways:<br><br>&lt;&lt; - Those I am committed to doing this week<br><br>&lt;&lt; - All others &gt;&gt;<br><br>That wouldn't work for me.

It is just what we ADD people have to deal with.  If we are to have a hope in hell of doing anything, we have to develop the resolve to get rid of the almost infinite barrage of "interesting" things.<br><br>It's just crazy in here, I tell 'ya, crazy!  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>2 September 2009 at 23:12 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, I don't have ADD, but I have the same problem.  <br><br>Thanks for the refresher on your method.  I've combined my 2 books and cut my estimated time to complete down to a week too (for C's - no time frame for A's)  I've put A's and C's together, just noting what level of importance they are in front of the item.  I'm pre-filtering in accordance with what I've said "yes" to, as acedia suggested, not using the list as a grass-catcher - yet. :-)  Hopefully at some point once I've trained myself, I won't even need to consciously filter or classify tasks.  That's what I do at work, so I know it's possible.<br><br>I only have 6 pages for the week, however there's no way I could get 300+ tasks done in 5 days or so, nor would I want to.  I like focusing for a couple of hours on a job where I can (like I said, I don't have ADD, and tasks that are too small seems to encourage a short attention span).  Hopping between tasks is just one step above multi-tasking to me.<br><br>Thanks again for all your help and feedback.  <br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 September 2009 at 1:32 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>My filtering is to get the list down to a manageable size and to keep it uncluttered.  So at 10 pages, with 20 items per page, that is just 200 items ... BUT ... most of those are completed now.  Some pages have only two or three tasks left on them.<br><br>I am  not yet monitoring the list with metrics, so I can't tell you much about the dynamics.  I think I added about 15 items to the list today, and completed about as many.  I expect to close a page or two tomorrow.<br><br>The method does not matter so long as:<br><br>- The list is of a manageable size<br><br>- It is easy to read ... I.E. is not cluttered with things that you are not going to do in the current review period<br><br>- The rules for processing are not burdensome ... (RAF is, for me, just on the ragged edge of having rules so complicated that the list becomes the focus and not the work.  As I said, with my smaller list, I just brows it in any order that strikes me and don't worry much about forward or reverse mode or complex dismissal rules.  If I won't do a task, it gets dismissed.)<br><br>- It is dynamic enough to keep up with your needs (that's why my grass catcher function of the AF list works for me ... a lot of things coming on to the list just occur to me ... but most of what occurs to me is nonsense ;-)<br><br>My grass catcher aspect is, as I mentioned, just to keep me from using a separate notebook for that purpose.  So long as I dismiss them instantly, there is no longer a problem.<br><br>I think it is probably good that you collapsed the two books into one.  Once you have sensitized yourself to A vs. C, it ought to be just as good ... and with one fewer books.  Reading for A tasks and ignoring C tasks is much like my ignoring dismissed tasks on the list.  They don't seem to get in the way.  I have found it helps to use the "bar" method that Mark suggested.  I connect my check boxes between completed or dismissed tasks so as to form a visually prominent "bar" that makes it easy to see the active tasks.<br><br>I'm happy things are working so well for you.  I think that the AF experience helps with getting things done in general.  It really does "change you".  For the better, I hope.  ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 September 2009 at 2:07 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have an easy metric - I can tell how well it's working by how much I'm billing out. August was quite a bit higher than any month I've had in the last year (and with a week off on holiday thrown in) with excellent progress made on my house renos.  More importantly, I'm feeling energized, not drained.   I just feel really on top of things and happy to have clarity.<br>I do feel that I have somehow let the system down by not being able to "autofocus" as was originally intended.  That the system should filter and get you to do what's important to you.  I don't know why this doesn't work as well for me as it does for others - or is it really working that well for them?  I wonder...  What is their metric / KPI?  I guess it just proves Lakein's theories of A's vs. C's are true - for some people.  I find it difficult to  believe that people on this forum are that different than 99% of the other people I've met in my working life though.  Sorry - using my inside voice there.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 September 2009 at 2:40 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>Billing:  Yeah, that is one good metric.  And the progress on the renos is good as well.  I don't know a good metric for enjoyment, relaxation, etc.<br><br>What I had in mind was just to track my througput over time as compared with myself.  I really don't see how it makes sense to compare with anyone else, or any arbitrary standaard.  If I wanted to cheat the system and raise throughput all I'd have to do is chunk down each task and then knock off three or four instead of one ... for the same amount of work.<br><br>I do think that kind of thing washes out once you get it set up and start moving.  I think that we tend to chunk tasks to the size that represents the same level of difficulty over all.  I'm  not going to have "Price Auto Insurance" one time then "Look up phone number", "Pick up phone", "Call First Insurance Co.", etc. the next.  I don't think we work that way.<br><br>I'd mostly be interested in things like tasks completed per week and tasks dismissed per week.  That might tell me something about how I'm working.<br><br>As and Cs:  Yup.  I think we are all the same there.  Cs are seductive.  They give the illusion of progress.  I do notice that I have a different internal feeling based on what I've done.  I can go a day knocking off Cs and feel very different about the world vs. spending the day working on one big A.  I think listening to that feeling is the best metric over all.<br><br>Cheating:  Well, I dunno.  I'm perfectly happy trusting my reasoning power.  That is why I have that ability.  I don't disrespect or distrust it at all.  Intuition is all well and good, but it operates at all levels.  My intuition tells me to dismiss a task because I'll never work on it.  My intuition tells me what project I want to work on this week.  Autofocus, using intuition, tells me which task to work on this moment among all of the tasks I've rationally decided that I want to work on this week.<br><br>I hear what Mark is saying about letting the list decide.  I just don't have machinery set up to work that way, I'm afraid.  I know in an instant ... the instant I write a task on my list ... thorough an internal feeling as I subconsciously project into the possible future doing that task (or not doing it) that it is right or wrong for the list right now.<br><br>So I don't feel I'm cheating the list.  I'm using it to decide from a collection of alternatives that I've rationally decided that I need to be doing this week.  I'm running a deadline in less than two weeks to get money spent on medical things.  So collecting receipts, looking at available balances on medical benefits, making an eye appointment, etc. are things that I MUST and WILL do within the next 12 days.  And those tasks are on the list and highlighted in bright pink and also on my list of "must do today" (when applicable).  I'm sure AF will tickle me to do things ... but not necessarily in a useful way.  I can't wake up on the morning of 9/15 and decide to try to get into see the eye doctor and slave away all day getting receipt collected, summarized, and in the mail.  That's crazy when there is a simple and obvious solution ... put the deadline on the calendar and the tasks on the "Ht List" so they get done in a timely way.  Just makes sense.  But then "sense" depends on who you are and how you function, I guess.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 September 2009 at 10:02 | Mike</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
