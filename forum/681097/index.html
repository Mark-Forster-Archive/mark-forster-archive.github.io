You can't mark tasks as done here, but you can re-add dismissed/done items or choose to never re-add them, which removes them from review view. <br><br>Added Option to display “Quick Add Task”<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>Finally you don't have to go to the separate task add page to add tasks to your list, but you can choose to display a quick add bar above or below your list. This can be configured under "Settings".<br><br>Added Option to display day markers<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>You can now choose between the old page creation date once on every page or day markers that appear within the list every time a new day started. This is also configurable under settings.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 March 2009 at 23:06 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Note that sometimes updates change the internal data model, which may make it necessary for you to login again even if you selected the "remember me" option.<br><br>If you have any suggestions, feel free to post them here.<br><br>Here's what's still on my list:<br><br>- The interface gets slowly more cluttered with each new feature, I want to create to different clean interfaces for mobile devices and the big screen.

So there are now multiple columns (classic one column layout will still be available). You can see tabs at the top to switch between multiple lists, and there are separate small lists for deadlines and due tasks. Note that this page is a non-working layout demonstration. <br><br>Please tell me what you think. For all IE-Users: the new layout doesn't really shine in IE6- (usable though). It looks best in Firefox 3.1 and Safari 3+, still great in Firefox 3.0 and good in IE8, IE7, Opera, Konqueror and Chrome.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2009 at 5:39 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas,<br><br>That looks very nice.<br><br>There is an article <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=a-recipe-for-motivation">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=a-recipe-for-motivation</a> that I think bears on your application. If the journalist who wrote the article describes the science correctly, our motivation to do a task can be increase by the physical clarity and neatness with which the letters in the words describing the task are written. <br><br>There have been other threads about neatness on this forum. I have a real problem with handwriting neatly, which is one reason why I find your application so exciting.

I long ago given up long hand and went to lettering.  Even so, I wrote in a crabbed style which was poorly spaced with letters of uneven size.  Then I realized that if I just slowed down and put my focus on each letter I COULD do better.  And it worked.  Now it may seem like a big sacrifice to slow down, it is not.  The payback I get from being able to quickly read what I wrote (rather than having to decipher it) gives me that time back each time I read my writing ... which is more times than I wrote it ;-)<br><br>I suggest just trying it for a day or so and seeing if you have the same results.  Form each letter carefully and keep the vertical size and horizontal spacing even.  Lather, rinse, repeat ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2009 at 19:30 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This looks good. I like the option of having time-related info (deadlines or ticklers) available as that would give me one place for everything.

I for one would gladly pay for the kind of service you're offering.  You've done a *lot* of work there.<br><br>Also, have you thought about having an iPhone app that syncs with the web version?

Would you consider adding some sort of API to the web interface to allow for remote syncing from an iPhone app?  Zenbe Lists works like this (and it's rock solid)...combining the web goodness you've written with a similarly-behaving iPhone app and allowing them to sync together would be a killer combination.<br><br>Just some thoughts...<br><br> - Erik.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 April 2009 at 21:41 | Erik</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas,<br><br>The voiceover surprised me as well.  I kept skipping to the next page and listening to two voiceovers overlaid. If you really don't have the time or patience you can find most of the material on the rest of his site, though the course is more productive. Or you can print the visuals (I'd print them to OneNote), which are generally pretty self explanatory. <br><br>You'll want to print the worksheets in any case.<br><br>BTW, comparing the web material and the visuals gives a great example of how the visuals should not just be bulletted notes.

And use lettering rather than the old Palmer style they taught in school.  It is slower but you more than make up the  time when you read it later.  No doubt his course is better than my advice, but if you don't have the patience for a course ... just slow down and you'll get a big pay off.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 April 2009 at 11:54 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas - I walked away from AF for over a month.

I'm working on mine also.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 June 2009 at 18:20 | AcademicPuff</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>You cannot dismiss tasks. You can only dismiss a page. If you try to move to another page without having done any tasks on the current page, you will be prompted to dismiss the page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 June 2009 at 19:20 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Looking at the previous four post, I come to the following conclusions:<br><br>a) Déjà-vu ^_^<br>b) Perhaps I should take the time to write a short help page with instructions.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 June 2009 at 10:47 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Confession: I sent Andreas a personal e-mail about a month ago with this same question.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 June 2009 at 19:19 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas - I love AF.cc -  will you be able to revise the website to the new AF2 approach?<br><br>Many thanks,<br><br>Derek</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 June 2009 at 22:02 | Derek D</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Derek:<br><br>Yes, I will. Just have to finish my thesis (deadline is today!) and give a presentation about it on Thursday, then I'll give AF.cc a major overhaul. You'll be able to switch between AF1 and AF2 rules on the fly. <br><br>Problem is, I will need to change the database structure, which means there is a risk of damaging existing data in the conversion. I will be as careful as possible. I will make a copy of the database and keep the old version available in case something goes wrong. <br><br>I will also inform everyone a few days ahead via email. I never did that before but I think it's necessary in this case. The new version will also sport an option to disallow me sending you emails. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 1:37 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Great news Andreas - and good luck with the thesis!!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 8:06 | Derek D</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Andreas,<br><br>Good luck with your thesis and Verteidigung(?)....<br>What is your field of study?

I'm studying software engineering.<br><br>There are currently 409 registered users, but my guess is that most of these just tested it and are not using it actively anymore. Haven't looked too deeply into it, though. I should implement a "delete my account" function. So far one person requested me to manually delete her account.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 11:07 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>In addition to "delete account" it would be nice to have a function "purge completed items." I've played around with it, like it, may start using it soon, but then I'll have these (completed) bogus tasks cluttering up the first page. Yes, I won't notice them anymore once I have a decent list going, but I'm a bit of a neat-freak :-).<br><br>BTW, thanks for making this public, it seems like a very nice and very streamlined application!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 16:10 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Nicole, as a fellow "neat freak" I use the "hide completed and dismissed" tasks in settings, I dont like seeing completed tasks either.  Andreas is the only software I know that MAKES you follow the rules of AF, well worth a go, especially once it is AF2 friendly.   <br><br>Andreas - any chance of an option to have new items placed at the top of the list somehow?, I would love to be able to work down the list when working back through the list.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Derek</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 0:56 | Derek D</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Andreas,<br><br>Thanks for satifying my curiosity.
