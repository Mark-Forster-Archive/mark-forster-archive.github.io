It got me thinking, recently the forum exploded with a bunch of new systems and of course the usual tweaks and add ons to those systems.  Yet, many do not persist for long periods of time.  I am sure some of it is the curiosity of the new, but I also think many systems just breakdown due to complexity.  the complexity of trying to have a system do everything or handle each possibility.  With complex systems comes the overhead of maintaining the system.  The reality is each moment spent organizing and managing time is a moment spent not doing something that needs to be done.<br><br>I have found simply writing in one place (a cheap notebook) got me 80% of the productivity of a complex system like GTD with virtually no overhead.  Has anyone else found a simple principle that have provided a huge benefit or like to comment on the issue of complexity?<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2010 at 18:52 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Complex systems do tend to break down, but I don't recall reports of anyone struggling with these new systems which really aren't all that complex anyway.<br><br>Simple principle that worked for me: To build a new habit, attach it to an old habit.<br><br>For example: write it into AutoFocus, or post it in your bedroom (I always get up in the morning...).  <br><br>They say it takes 30 days to establish a habit, but following the above principle it's trivial to keep many things going for 30 days until it's ingrained.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2010 at 20:20 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Gerry, <br><br>Actually I agree with you. I feel trying to account for everything and every eventuality with a complete system can feel a little like a straight jacket to me. And I spend time thinking about productivity at the expense of being productive.<br><br>A question for you re triple task: What signal do you have in your notebook to show there are no more outstanding tasks on a page in your notebook? (By the way, I personally do not like removing pages).<br><br>I think my simple principle to offer up is 'inbox to zero'. It's made my life a lot easier by following this idea.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2010 at 21:38 | leon</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon,<br><br>You could just line through the entire page, so you will ignore it when you flip through it.  Alternatively you could put a post it flag on the pages that do have tasks to be considered.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2010 at 21:48 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>leon:<br><br>&lt;&lt; What signal do you have in your notebook to show there are no more outstanding tasks on a page in your notebook? &gt;&gt;<br><br>My practice with all forms of AF and its derivatives has been to write a cross (X) on the top outside corner of a finished page and to put a circle round it when there are no earlier pages with outstanding tasks.<br><br>Putting a vertical line in the left margin which joins the horizontal deletion marks also helps one to see immediately how many tasks are on a page.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 December 2010 at 22:42 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Leon,<br>I use a notebook with squares rather than lines.  To the left of each entry I draw in a narrow column and after working on a task I fill in the square beside it - this makes it really easy to see unactioned tasks, and when the page is complete you have a fully filled-in column.  It would work equally well on lined, rather than squared paper.<br>Best wishes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2010 at 11:45 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with Alan. "Complex systems do tend to break down". David Allen said in GTD that complex world needs complex systems. I don't agree at all. Since AF1 i realized that simpliest system could really work and leads to efficiency. <br><br>Gerry, little by little my system becomes lighter. As it's still moving i won't curve it in the marble. But I may explain how it is now, and you may be surprised by it simplicity... <br><br>I have a A4 thin binder and sheets of paper i add little by little. All in handwritten. <br>Pages are organised like this :<br>1. monthly objectives weekly detailed. Monthly objectives is XXX, YYY, ZZZ<br>ie W50 do this and so on, W51 XXX, YYY and so on (...)<br>2. Detailed weekly ojective. <br>+Heuristic weekly objective<br>+Daily objectives from monday to sunday<br>3. Project list<br>4. AF list . I finally prefer SF as summarized by Ubi. (but i tried AF4R)<br>the only exceptions are how are organised my others paper sheets (see 5 to 14)<br>5. UNFINISHED tasks (this comes from AF4R<br>6. RECURRING TASKS<br>7.TIKLER organised by quarter<br>8. DO EVENTUALLY (it's a GTD someday may be list)<br>9. Personal AF1 list<br>10. Projects (one page by project) <br>example Cergy building, example Company organization, accountant<br>11. Some check lists ex.  weekly review<br>12. Historical : it's my tasks journal. I like reporting each evening what i have done to decide what i will do. <br>13. Notes (Daily notes are classified and summarized if necessary later. If they don't I trash them)<br>14. Contacts list. These lists are useful for me them help me to focus on some people.<br><br>The system is indeed simple. I could do it on a computer, an ipad, a paper sheet or even on the web (google and so on). But I prefer it on paper with my own handwriting. I have a better focus. All details, documents and so on are on my computer<br><br>I noticed some real advantages about my way of working and thinking.<br>I have a real control about things. I feel focus and quiet. <br><br>I often take time to work on a specific project (often in the night because i d'ont always sleep very well so i wake up and work or read) when i feel in the mood and I have the energy to do it.<br><br>If I look back and take some altitude about my own organization I notice that I follow most of advices of MF and this forum which helps me very much. Life is quiet complicated. More complex are the things much complicated becomes life. So I indeed believe that whatever system we use they must suits to our own way of feelings and doing things. Some needs complicated systems to be efficient, some like me prefer easy system to give them nothing but guideline in their way of doing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2010 at 12:54 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I can see each individual thing is simple, but you sure have a lot of them.  By comparison I keep 7 of those:<br>1. quarterly goals<br>3. AF list of projects<br>4. SF list<br>7.Calendar<br>10. Project pages (alphabetical)<br>12. Completed AF pages<br>13. Notes aka Work journal</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2010 at 13:45 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yes Alan. The main basis are these. <br>I like your ability to synthesize things ;-)<br>But point 5+6 help me to focus on the MIT<br>8. is a kind of warehouse i often read which gives me ideas for the future,<br>11 Check list are very helpful when i need to do a complicated project example buiding analysis,<br>14. Is helpful because i know a lot of people and it's difficult to focus on each of them. So i extracted from my data base some of them to focus the most I can.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2010 at 14:54 | FocusGuy.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This may be slightly off topic, but, would you please talk about what you mean by a "heuristic weekly objective?"<br><br>Thank you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2010 at 18:42 | mary</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Well heuristic = mind mapping. it is a method invented by Tony Buzan. The idea is to draw schemes or mind map. I love it for creative work and use it a lot even in meetings. <br>A few years ago, before using AF  I used it for everything but it was too much. <br>Now I use it when I am on the rush to simply extract from my mind the ideas. <br>It's very powerfull.<br>Here is a link. <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.brianmicklethwait.com/education/archives/MindMapSmaller.jpg">http://www.brianmicklethwait.com/education/archives/MindMapSmaller.jpg</a><br>and an interesting video <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_2undwiqY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_2undwiqY</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2010 at 7:35 | FocusGuy.</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
