Changing systems is like changing the type of exercise you are doing from running to weightlifting and then to yoga and then back to running  - you're never going to get fit that way.

Unless you're power lifting and trying to swim competitively, for example, using different skill sets and types of energy usage is a good all round way of staying fit.  Before I was disabled, I did many different sports in the same week.  I liked the variety. Even if I was rehearsing for a competition, I still enjoyed different sports.  If I run a few miles in the morning, water ski in the afternoon and dance at night, I can still run the next morning, maybe swim some laps, and play some soccer or basketball in the afternoon.  That wouldn't stop me from going dancing that night.  I think the variety of skills and difference types and levels of competition and mastery building kept me interested in sports all of my life.  Same with seasons.  The outdoor sports I engage in during winter are going to be quite different than the outdoor sports the summer offers.  As I said, if you're not building opposing muscle sets, there's no harm.....but a lot of challenge and fun!<br><br>As usual, everybody's different.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2015 at 2:06 | Learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi all<br>I agree with Gerry in that I like to know what I need to do and what I want to do.  I do it via my weekly version of Mark's DIT.  I'm good at creating my Will Do list and thanks to Mark and this forum, I don't need to fret too much about high resistance.<br><br>Nuntym,<br>If you make your list, randomization helps immeasurably if you need a bit of help with resistance.  What I do is create a sublist of a few items and add percentages. 40% chance of getting the most dreaded job (the reason for the randomization), 30% chance of another MIT on the will do list and 30% chance of choosing my work.  Along with the Will do list, I always add a few other tasks and/or jobs that I want in my concerns.  They can serve as relief tasks when I'm doing head banging work or work that I hate. The principles behind DIT are pure gold.  Mark's resistance principle and the concept of using work arounds against the resistance is also pure gold but, little and often, is pure platinum!  It's impossible to fail with these three principles of Mark's.   The Will Do part gives me determination.  The resistance tricks help with my stubborn refusal or overwhelm and the little and often wipes out any flimsy excuses not to keep starting until it's done.  I'm not saying that it's easy.  Like Mark says, "It's doable."</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2015 at 2:16 | Learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>I think that one of the best things I learned here is not to fret when I find that I've veered off course.  Whether it was purely because of brain damage or clever, subconscious avoidance doesn't really matter.  The Will Do list is there to reassert my determination.  If there's no resistance, I simply proceed as usual. If there's resistance, then I combine little and often and any resistance work around.  It may sound silly but I feel more confidence knowing that I can redirect my efforts when I've gone astray than trying to do it correctly all the time.  I'm fallible to say the least.  There's no loss of pride in getting back on the horse.  "Cowboy up!"  I'd never be foolish enough to expect myself never to falter.  What I don't expect is to give up because I went off course and then blow it off because I screwed up.  That would failure!  Mark has given us a fail proof system as long as we keep at it one way or the other.

I find that thinking puzzling. A system of any kind is simply a standard operating procedure. A consistent way of doing something. Your approach has been fine-tuned so the results you want show up consistently and efficiently, and not just once in a while. If time management systems and other standardized approaches are crutches, our entire world runs on crutches. And I'm glad it does.<br><br><br>"They should help up develop willpower and good habits if we are lacking those."<br><br>... Agreed. Slow, perfect repetition of a sequence, system, method, or approach builds consistent habits and lowers resistance as you gain confidence in your skills and your systems. Lack of willpower is lack of confidence in your systems and skills to get the job done efficiently. Developing better systems develops better skills which develops more willpower. You internalize what you can (principles, rules, sequences) and externalize what you can't (critical checklists, lists, new standard operating procedures etc.). Speed of execution and efficiency follow automatically as you practice accurately.<br><br><br>"The question is whether we should live the rest of our lives with crutches or should we wean ourselves of them."<br><br>... If that's the question, the answer is we should live the rest of our lives with crutches. But that's not the question I would ask. I would ask: <br><br>"How can we standardize our approach to our life management in a way that allows us to keep all of our commitments while not building our resistance; is sustainable, easy to use, teachable, and uses the fewest easily-available resources as possible? And after we have a working system, where is it lacking and how can we improve that in the simplest way possible?"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2015 at 20:00 | Michael B.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Michael B:<br><br>I agree with you 100 per cent.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2015 at 20:49 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Michael<br>Ideally, I agree 100% but it's not my wonderful system that needs improving (thanks to Mark). I am a flawed human being.  No system can alter what's going on in my body or in my brain. I feel no shame in adding little and often and resistance work arounds to my operating procedure. Without learning these coping skills and tricks (thanks yet again to Mark and also the forum posters), I wouldn't have the confidence to create my will do lists plus many other things I also accomplish in the day.  I'll further state that many days, the will do list is completed because of my resistance "prosthetic devices" and the determination that comes from drawing up a will do list.  <br><br>There's nothing overall wrong with my character nor my working results.  Since I was a child, I've always struggled with surmounting boredom.  My teachers went so far as to segregate me from the rest of the class because of it.  It did not stop me from getting superior marks in school.  It never stopped me from doing a superior job in my career.  I wish I didn't have the type of brain that creates such a struggle for me.  On the other hand, this old lump of grey matter also serves me well in other areas.  It's easier for me to not compare my methods to any ideal.  I simply focus on getting my desired results no matter how ridiculous my work arounds may seem to others.  I'm definitely not alone.  Society calls it "artistic temperament" or ADHD or other assorted labels.  I call it doing the best I can with what I am. There's no shame in that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2015 at 22:25 | Learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>p.s.<br>If you're creating or problem-solving, sometimes there is no standard operating procedure outside creating your hypothesis, running your experiments according to criteria set by other scientists in your field and evaluating your results and drawing conclusions. However, much of the actual thinking that is needed is definitely outside the box thinking. It could happen in your dreams, spontaneously while you're in the shower. Original thought isn't bound my facts and rules. It simply implements them as tools much like an artist manipulates paint on the canvas.<br><br>see AndreasE's new thread: All-consuming tasks.  He's an international best selling author of science fiction.  His writing technique may follow certain basic formulas for novel writing, but the content is his pure, unbridled imagination.  His imagination guides his thoughts and writing. I can guess that he's not even aware of the passage of time when he's in the flow. He certainly isn't constricted by "operating procedures"......until maybe editing time.  LOL!<br><br>Bottom line, imagination is required for problem-solving, planning for the future and creating anything.  Trust me, there will be resistance.  There's no "shoulds" about it.  You just do what you need to do without worrying about it.  If you meet resistance, you don't think "There shouldn't be any resistance."  You just work around it.  No judgements.  Only results.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2015 at 22:48 | Learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Learning:<br><br>In my new book (to which Andreas has kindly contributed a chapter on writing) I say that there is a hierarchy of routines and/or systems. If one doesn't get the low-level routines right, then that is going to impact on the high-level stuff. For instance a concert pianist who hasn't got their basic administration sorted out is going to find that their lack of organization will impact negatively on the higher level artistic work.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2015 at 22:59 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark<br>I totally agree with that.  Our basic habits are the structure of the day.  I'm suggesting that resistance isn't always controllable via a system.  I don't judge my system based on resistance I feel.  I've been bypassing resistance since I started school.  LOL!   I've always preached to myself to keep my responsibilities current or slightly ahead so that I can create without worries tamping down my passion or imagination.  I also like to stay current in case life offers a surprise opportunity.  I'm simply stating that experiencing resistance doesn't necessarily reflect badly on my system.  It doesn't even reflect badly on me as a person.  It's only an emotional response to a stimulus. But you already know that.  You are the leading expert on both the nature of resistance and how to bypass it and also encouraging a passionate life while meeting one's responsibilities.  No other productivity guru comes even close to addressing these issues as intelligently as you do.  Furthermore, your various principles and systems give proper attention to resistance.  You know that we're not robots.  We're people who experience resistance for many different reasons ranging form a visceral recoiling from boredom to approaching original work that's unknown to you when you embark on creating it.  You truly understand us.  That's why your knowledge and advice is so valuable.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2015 at 23:12 | Learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Michael B: I agree with Mark Forster, your answer was excellent.
