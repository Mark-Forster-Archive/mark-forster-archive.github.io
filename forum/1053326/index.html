I personally have never cared if a list is open or closed.  I personally came to realize I must prioritize and plan my work flow and no system will do that for me.  As I mentioned I use my system to make sure I have captured what I need or would like to get done and then just review the list which is in my case a steno notebook and start doing things.  It doesn't bother me if the list grows or shrinks is active or backlog, this to me is the ebb and flow of work and life.  <br><br>To me the best processor is my mind and not a mechanical system or sequence.  At the end of the day, we all need to pick the next thing we need to work on and start it.<br><br>Gerry<br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simple-time-management.com">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2010 at 16:35 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gary P wrote:<br>&lt;&lt;&lt;I can't see each page as a closed list, I just see one 28 page open list that ends at today+20 but is still growing. i.e.a really big todo list.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>You don't get the "closed list" effect from the list as a whole, but rather from each individual page.  Each page is a closed list, except the +7 and +1M pages.<br><br>So, it is as a series of closed lists.  The DWM rules have you looking at one page at a time, and each page is a closed list (except the +7 and +1M pages).  <br><br>Unlike AF1, in DWM each closed list has a slightly different time pressure on it, which affects the "standing out" of the tasks on that page.  <br><br>Some days, I have time to cycle through all my pages, several times.  But on many days, I don't have time for that, and I just focus on the small set of tasks that will expire within the next week.  This set of pages is itself a closed list, and that helps me focus.  When I feel I need a break, I might go on an excursion and look at later pages for a diversion.  But then I try to get back to the more pressing tasks on the first 6 pages and focus on them.  Those first six pages effectively become my DIT "will do" list for the day.  Once I take some action on them, if they aren't done yet, they get pushed out to Today+7, so I don't have to keep looking at them right now.<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;You are saying with DWM(28) that I have 26 active closed lists and 2 active open lists.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, that is correct.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;And that I don't have to complete ANY active lists regardless of whether they are closed or open.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>That is correct -- with the caveat that any tasks remaining on today's page will expire and be deleted at the end of the day.  In practical terms, this can mean several things:<br><br>(a) Those tasks are really not important to you, and you can let them go.<br><br>(b) Those tasks represent a commitment that you are failing to meet, and you need to figure out why.  Was there a temporary setback of some kind that caused you to let these tasks slip?  Or are you just overcommitted?  Do you need to learn to say "NO" to new commitments, and maybe prune down your existing commitments?<br><br>(c) Maybe the problem is motivation.  Maybe the task just seems to daunting.  Is there any way you can overcome that hurdle?  Maybe delegate the task to someone else / pay someone else to do it?  Maybe reformulate the task / break it up into smaller chunks?  <br><br>(d) Maybe it just isn't the right time yet?  You can put the task on the back burner, and feed it back into DWM in a few months, to see if that makes any difference.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;Do I have to work the tasks in sequence?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Mark recommends that you go from the beginning of the list (i.e., the first task on today's list), and sequentially move through the entire list, taking action on anything that "feels ready" to be done.<br><br>That's usually what I do, but sometimes when I am feeling pressed, I focus only on the first 6 days, as I described above.<br><br>The nice thing about this approach is establishing a methodical habit.  I just keep cycling through, keep cycling through.  If I start jumping around, it becomes more frenetic and less methodical, and I end up not really knowing where to start, and feel overwhelmed.  F<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;Do I start each day at task 1 of today?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>Mark recommends that you just continue where you left off.  But if you have been away from your list for a few days, I find it best to start from the beginning.<br><br><br>Hope that helps.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2010 at 2:44 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry wrote:<br>&lt;&lt;&lt;To me the best processor is my mind and not a mechanical system or sequence.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>The form and context of how you present choices to yourself matters a great deal.   The mechanics of Mark's systems don't replace the processing power of your mind.  Rather, they provide a systematic, regularized form and context that presents your tasks to you in a way that allows your mind to do the processing.  The different methods (ie. AF1, AF2, AF4, DWM) of formatting and contextualizing your tasks are all general enough to be useful in different environments, but as Mark explained in his recent blog posts, each method has its strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>It sounds like your steno-pad approach is another way of doing the same thing -- forming a habit that allows you to consistently format and provide context for each task.  <br><br>I think that's all a system can be expected to do.  None of these take away your decision-making power or your need to think and process.<br><br>It's like an assembly line process.  An assembly line doesn't remove the need to actually do the work.  It just organizes it and provides a framework around it, so that you can focus on the tasks.  But different industries need different assembly line setups -- what works in the auto industry won't work so well in the semiconductor industry, but both industries can gain insights by looking at how similar problems are handled in different industries.<br><br>Sorry if that last paragraph is veering off into theoretical la-la-land...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2010 at 2:52 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have often found in work and life, that when you present people with a blank page, and ask them to come up with ideas, it can be very painful and slow and unproductive.  But when you present a straw man for people to comment on, suddenly you bring out people's interest, they start to criticize the straw man, they start to improve it, they suggest that it be discarded and replaced with something new.  <br><br>In other words, it can be helpful to provide some lines to color inside of.  But the purpose of the lines is not necessarily to force people color inside of them.  The purpose of the lines is to get people thinking about where the lines really should be drawn, and to redraw the picture as needed, until you finally get the picture you want.<br><br>Another analogy -- if I ask my kids, what do you want to do this weekend?    Sometimes they have a clear idea of what they want to do.  And that's great!  But quite often the answer is, "I don't know".  Silence.  Nobody says anything.   So, I can start presenting ideas, maybe this, or maybe that, or maybe ...   Still, no answer.  If I then present "either A or B", then it can sometimes get the discussion going.  Maybe someone likes A, nobody likes B, and it gets them thinking about it, and finally we decide on C.  <br><br>A free-form, system-less method for managing tasks can easily generate that silence, that lack of motivation, that uncertainty about what you should be doing next.  When you focus it down to a closed list, then it makes it a lot easier to get going.  It's not a magic pill, but it gets your engine started, and you can make some progress.<br><br>FWIW, YMMV, etc.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2010 at 2:59 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim wrote: "The form and context of how you present choices to yourself matters a great deal."<br><br>This is so nicely put!<br><br>I think we all know that if we consistently commit to more tasks than we complete or delete, we will increase our backlog.
