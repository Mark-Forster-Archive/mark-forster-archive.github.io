I haven't seen her for some time, during which she's married, and so changed name, and moved.  It will take a little effort to track her down.  But I did get a card from her announcing the birth of her first child, so that will tell what I need to know, if only I can find it.<br><br>Going through the last few years of personal filing is an unappetising task, so I have procrastinated on it until it's the last item on the page.  Did I really have to do this tedious thing now, or choose to consigning recontacting an old friend to the rejected tasks list?<br><br>And then I realised that another friend probably knew the necessary information.  One quick email to him, and I had a repy quite soon afterwards.<br><br>This makes for an interesting contrast with GTD.  I've never been an adherent of that, but as I understand it a key idea is to write down the next action for each goal.  Doing that, I would have written "Find Sarah's address in files".  It would have taken a leap of imagination to escape that tramline once committed to in writing.  AF's encouragement to refactor the question has the opposite effect, deferring definition of the next action as long as possible, and leaving more room for the discovery of creative alternatives.<br><br>It's ironic that the deferral I'm enthusing about here is itself a kind of intentional procrastination.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 12:24 | David C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi David<br><br>That's a really helpful post and identifies that in fact our very procrastination can be the key to finding the solution.  Somehow our mind knows the answer but our usual practice is to overlay that with our logic or to attach it to another task so firmly that it takes something quite drastic to dislodge that link in our minds.<br><br>Thank you for that post - that has really helped me to identify why a couple of similar issues have resolved for me the way they did.  The absolutely best thing for me about AF is actually NOT the getting things done but the fact that I can now see WHY I was not getting things done and can do something about that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 12:33 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I completely agree with your comment Christine about why you don't get something done - I've been reviewing the home notebook over the last few days and questioning the tasks I was even adding to the list. I felt so much resistance to so many of them and realized that actually, I wasn't even that bothered or committed to a whole swathe of tasks I'd added - I'd put them on the list because they were things I felt I should do, e.g. read books I've had for ages, tasks for commitments that I'm really not that bothered about, etc.<br>It's led to me to the point where I'm completely rethinking what on earth my free time should be invested in and for what purpose. When you see everything you do laid out in black and white it's quite astonishing - I just flit from project to project, idea to idea, with no real goal in mind for any of them.<br><br>I've refactored/rephrased a number of tasks recently, and they are much more approachable now - having time to look at and think about what you want to do really allows your mind to subconsciously find the right path to do so, if it's something you genuinely want to get done!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 12:51 | faye</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting point.  One of the things that has occurred to me over the past few days is how restrictive (for me, at least) is the insistence of defining a precise 'Next Action' that needs to be written down.   This works well enough for most things,  but for me it was the cause of procrastination a lot of the time,  simply because working out what the prescriptive 'Next Action' should be often triggered a Reactive instead of a Rational response.<br><br>AF is much more open to an alternative way of thinking - more along the lines of 'how do I move this along'.  Because the thing that will move a project along will differ from one moment to the next.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 14:14 | Dave</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>All the above comments are very helpful. This is a sharp divide between GTD and AF. Despite the fact that both of them subscribe to the principle of analysis, which urges us to divide big things into small, digestible pieces, their implementations of that principle differ markedly (sorry about that).<br><br>The NA concept forbade phrasing items vaguely. With AF I usually phrase my items by some vague reference to the overall project. Then when it's time to action that item I shape that action to fit the time available, my energy level, etc. In AF the plan is to do _something_, but what that something is, is usually not predetermined. In GTD the plan is to do the next required physical action.<br><br>In reality, the restrictions on NA formulations were almost impossible to fulfill. Any action can have an infinite number of descriptions. Is it "Kill John" or "Flex my right index finger"? How we describe it is extremely sensitive to our mood at any given time. Is it "Call potential customer," or "Open telephone list to find customer's phone number"? It all depends, and AF allows much more sensitivity to this indeterminacy.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 15:29 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>David C,<br>Thanks for the phrase "the mounting pressure to do something about an obstinate task."  That describes perfectly the psychic effect of having to review something on the list over and over again.  In a different system - true for how my GTD system has ended up - if I didn't review it (not good with weekly reviews), then I didn't see it over and over, as with AF.  It would just periodically bubble up in my mind and gnaw at me or I would suddenly come screeching upon a deadline.  Looking at my AF pages again and again means it's always in front of me.  It's in my face.  I have something like that right now that I'm trying to get a breakthrough on.  It's a set of important red tape things I have to do as part of my job, but it doesn't feel very urgent.  And, it's a huge pain.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 17:42 | Balfour</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>yes yes YES David C! Thanks so much for posting this. The whole "next action" step of GTD never really worked for me. I have found some surprising solutions to tasks using AF, whereas a GTD "next action" could just result in some huge stuckness/ procrastination problems for me. With AF, I am finding that the "long gestation" (frequent reviewing) lets me "poke away" at a problem over time, and sometimes results in an unexpected, but happy solution ... sometimesI can't even say exactly how I got to it, other than it is from the "inspiration" that sometimes comes when one's subconscious has been mulling over something ... <br><br>THANKS all who have contributed such great thoughts to this thread! Very much appreciated. I am going to see if I can nurture this aspect of AF even more ....</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 17:57 | Bev</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This thread spurred me to take a look at something obstinately lounging on page one of my notebook and I was able to do one teeny thing and then move the whole item/project forward!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 18:07 | Balfour</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Isn't it amazing how just that one, previously unidentified action can absolutely unblock something.  It's like struggling to open a stuck door only to realise that you hadn't seen a tiny catch - once that is released everything can flow through!  With most systems we'd be left pulling and pushing on the door with brute force - with AF it's as though we can just stop and ask "why isn't this opening - oh look, it's because I haven't undone the catch"  and without panic, without struggle, without someone saying you MUST open that door immediately!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 18:53 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Got an email back from Sarah within 24 minutes of sending mine, about ten years after last seeing her.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>4 February 2009 at 23:23 | David C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Very cool.
