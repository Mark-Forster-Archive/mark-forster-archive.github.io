I started putting a date next to them but its tedious having to scan all pages to find and count up the tasks I've worked on or done today - all I want is a quick method of recording the total done. <br><br>Two questions: is there any real benefit in keeping a track of tasks done per day and if so, what's the easiest way to do it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2009 at 8:51 | Linda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Linda<br><br>I don't feel there's a major benefit to keeping track of number of tasks; I guage my progress more on a sense of productivity.  However I have kept track to a degree simply because it is interesting to know :-)<br><br>The easiest way I think is by using a table, in for example Excel. Just list the number of items outstanding on each active page, total it, and record the total against the relevent date.  Next day, or when you want to check again, just update the totals, take one from t'other, and there you have it.  If you average say about 15-20 active pages it shouldn't take long to count the number of items left per page and then keep that running total.<br><br>Hope that helps ........</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2009 at 9:09 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hello Linda,<br><br>Although I keep my listst on my iphone and pc, I keep record of the tasks I've done simply by writing them down in a little notebook. For me that's the easiest and most fast way. <br>Also the fysical act of writing and seeing all these items together in a book gives me a great feeling of satisfaction. For me that's the benefit of keeping record of tasks done: it's works as a compliment and encouragement.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2009 at 9:40 | Canta</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Linda,<br><br>Are you using each page of your AF book as a closed list? If you are, you shouldn't really need to scroll back through numerous pages to work out what you've done, I think?<br><br>If you're using your AF list as one long to-do list, I'd heartily recommend the closed list approach as it seems to have helped my productivity no end.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2009 at 9:44 | little b</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Also, I should have added that on long, ongoing tasks and projects, I am noting next to them in the margin how long I spent on that particular task on that particular occasion. Also crossing it out in red so that the black writing underneath remains legible yet the 'ongoing' nature of the task remains visibly clear.<br><br>If I beat my previous 'personal best' time on a particular task, I use it as an opportunity to reward myself with a coffee, magazine or favourite TV programme, which is proving great motivation for tasks that I was really resisting.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2009 at 9:47 | little b</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Linda: <br><br>Although I'm sure it's not necessary, purely a matter of personal choice,  I think it's very interesting to keep a record of how many items have been added to the AF list and how many have been crossed off.   I do my calculations at the end of each day.  Since I started AF (on 19 January) I have added 755 items, and crossed off 406 (i.e.the percentage of crossed-off items compared to the total number of items on the whole list is about 54%).  <br><br>I use the right-hand side of my notebook for the AF list, and the left-hand side for any notes I want to make.  On the Notes side of whichever page I start on, I write today's date and  every time I cross off an item on that page,  I put a small mark beside the date, then it's easy to go through each page I've worked on and count the number of crossed-off items.  When you add the first item of the day to your AF list, put the date in the margin, so then it's easy to see how many items you've added that day.  I then total up the crossed-off items for that day, and total up the added items for that day, and re-calculate.    (One thing that I can't yet get my head round is that on most days, even though I'm adding more items than I'm crossing off, the number of crossed-off items as a percentage of the total number on the list is getting higher).<br><br>At first I felt guilty that I'd win 6 cross-offs for doing a one-off non-recurring item.   For example, I had an item "send cheque to X" appearing 6 times on my AF list, not because I was doing some action on it then re-writing it at the end of the list, but because I added it to the end of the list every time it crossed my mind.  So as well as gaining a cross-off on page 9 where it first appeared, I also gained 5 cross-offs for where it appeared elsewhere on the AF list.  That made me feel I was cheating, until the penny dropped that I'd also ADDED it 6 times, so in the end it all balanced out when I calculated the percentage of crossed-off items compared to the total number of items on the whole list.<br><br>One thing that I feel is especially good about the AF system is that, even on days when I feel I haven't done much, when I do the calculation at the end of the day,  I have crossed off about 50 items.  I suppose that's because at times when I'm not working from the AF list, I still do some of the items on the list, so next time I'm working on the AF<br>list I can happily cross off several items.   So although it's not necessary to do the daily calculation, I feel it gives a boost to my motivation.<br><br>Mark, I'm really enjoying trying out Aufofocus, and the forum is fantastic - it's wonderful that so many people are taking the time to describe their experiences.  <br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 January 2009 at 13:21 | Margaret1</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Margaret:<br><br>Thanks for your posting - it's very interesting to see how different people work with AF.
