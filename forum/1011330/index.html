I do a mix of scheduled work and creative work.  I would love to be able to schedule my time and have it magically work out the way it does for Mick Cool in DIT, but I can't ever seem to make it work. <br><br>Example: Today I had a client call scheduled for 9am and I blocked off an hour.  I called and got voicemail.  Left a message reminding her of the meeting and then went to work on my DWM list.  20 minutes later, she returns the call and we talk for an hour (her phone lines were down due to an ice storm).  Now my day is off by 20 minutes and I'm late starting the next project block on my schedule.  I can't not take the call or cut off the client early when things like that happen, especially when the delay was weather related.  I am a freelancer and client calls = money.  I try to work with the client as long as it's reasonable to do so.<br><br>My second issue is with creative work.  I would love to start off every day by doing only creative work for a few hours.  I can block off this time (and reschedule as needed when I have to take a call).  What I can't determine is if it makes more sense to block out time for creative work and then cherry pick the "creative" tasks from my DWM list, or keep those items on a separate list and refer only to that list when I'm working on creative stuff.<br><br>Same thing for client work.  If I send an estimate to a client for 6 hours of work and he agrees, then I immediately block off the time on my schedule so it's booked.  Should I then dump the tasks that need to be done for the project into my DWM list or keep them separate and refer to them when I get to the time blocks?  <br><br>I think the reason I struggle is that often times I block out 3 hours to start the project only to find out that one hour into it I need to clarify something with the client so it gets put on hold.  I can't "map out my day" because there are so many variables.  Case in point...today we are having a snowstorm and my kids are home from school which changes my routine for the entire day.   <br><br>On one hand, I like having things mapped out so I don't overbook, but on the other hand, my "map" can get blown out of the water the minute I step into my office.  Even "buffering" between time blocks has failed on many occasions.  Given the advantages of AF1-4 and DWM, etc.  What is the best, most flexible approach to scheduling issues like these without the fear of overcommitment?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2010 at 16:56 | Gretchen</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I suppose the other option is to throw it all into DWM and let my intuition sort it out.  My only fear with that option is that I will overbook and miss client deadlines.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2010 at 17:02 | Gretchen</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would not throw my creative work into DWM or DIT or AUTOFOCUS or any other master list.   I don't want my creative work mixed with chores, errands, or anything of that kind.  I keep it separate - and I go to it first thing every day. Call it your Current Initiative, or by any other name -- but keep it separate.  That's my view.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2010 at 17:17 | Steve</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seems to me you only need to get the hours in, not schedule them, because scheduling isn't working.  Me, I'd put these in the list because I don't want two sources of work (the blocks and the diary).<br><br>If you don't want to overbook, maybe marking expected hours beside the tasks (the big ones only) would help.  Any more than 40h/wk (or whatever) is overbooked.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2010 at 18:00 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gretchen <br><br>My reaction was that your client doesn't value your time.  Perhaps you could have explained (even if its a lie) that you have another client at 10 so she only gets 40 mins and that your rules are that she pays for an hour.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2010 at 20:07 | Man of Kent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gretchen,<br><br>Perhaps 'lying to the client', like Man suggested, would have helped in that particular case, but I'm afraid that there will always be something unexpected happening and ruining best laid plans. C'est la vie. And honestly, if being '20 minutes off' messes up your day badly, it might be a good idea to look how you schedule/block time in your calendar. Do you allow yourself enough 'buffer time' between the blocks to cope with the unexpected?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2010 at 20:26 | JMTee</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Gretchen<br><br>I think you've raised some important points here and I'm sure you will get different opinions on what's best.<br><br>My way of handling project-type tasks that have fixed deadlines is to time-box them. I treat them as the 'Big Rocks' in my week that I really want or need to achieve. For example if I'm preparing a set of teaching material that must be delivered in three weeks and needs about 8-10 hours work, I break the task down into sub-tasks of about 2-3 hours and map them on my calendar over the next two weeks, to make sure I can complete the work on time. It reduces my anxiety level, just knowing that I have time to finish it!<br><br>If I get a competing request for a block of time I've set aside to work, it's much easier to say to others - sorry I'm not available, or at least (if it's something I can't avoid) look at my calendar and see where and how I can re-schedule my scheduled work. It helps me to see if I'm getting over-committed as well.<br><br>I only schedule 2 - 3 of these self-appointments a day and try to have plenty of unscheduled time for working my list as well. The key thing I find is not to over-book my week but leave plenty of buffer time, as delays and interruptions are inevitable. The downside, if any, is having to manage work which lives both in my calendar and my list but I don't find it a problem in practice.<br><br>I don't put these scheduled tasks on my AF list but on a project checklist. I keep my list for tasks that don't have a fixed time of the day associated with them and I work the list when I have no appointments.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2010 at 20:58 | Linda</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gretchen:<br><br>How often do your days get interrupted and thrown off schedule? For many people the answer to that question is "every day". If that is the case, then planning your day without leaving time for interruptions is just asking for trouble. As JMTee says the answer is to increase your buffer time each day. And to do that probably means cutting your commitments. Which probably means you are overbooked already.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 February 2010 at 21:55 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I was using two AF4 lists but, since I started DWM I use only one list. I realized that I need to take rests regularly (I do a creative work most of the time) so having errands and little tasks between the ceative and work tasks in fact is good. Because doing 5 minutes a little taks is a way to rest from my main work (would it be "read Mark's forum", or "go buy chocolate", or "check mail").<br>I am doing DWM for a week and I was very busy at work, but I managed to follow the deadlines every day. And more easily than before DWM.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2010 at 3:12 | isd</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks for all the replies.  I probably am a little overbooked.  I run two businesses and manage a band - all three of which are taking off very successfully.  I am learning to delegate things as much as I can with other members of my team.  That being said, I think my main issue is that I try to touch on all three businesses every work day and that makes it feel like more of a squeeze on my time than it really is.  I think I will try rearranging my week so that I'm focusing on each of these areas on specific days rather than a little bit each day.  Might help with the mental shift as well.  <br><br>I will probably remove the creative work from my DWM list.  Since I have a time block for it on my schedule, there's no need to have it in the list.  It can be housed in it's own list for reference.  I'm also going to shorten my time blocks from 2 hours to 90 minutes to see if that helps with the buffer times.  Thanks for the ideas.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2010 at 14:19 | Gretchen</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>My work cycles rapidly between "discretionary time" and emergent work. Without going too much into how I handle this with AFx (this is a site for discussing Mark's work not mine), I have found the following to be helpful. I like paper. David Seah's emergent task planner is a big help for me.<br><br>FWIW.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://davidseah.com/blog/comments/emergent-task-planner-free-version-updates/">http://davidseah.com/blog/comments/emergent-task-planner-free-version-updates/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 February 2010 at 15:13 | Norman U.</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
