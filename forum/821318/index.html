Rausch</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If older items become urgent, then your rational/intuitive mind will begin to "drive" you up the list.  This is one reason for reading through the list each morning.  You will find that the newer items just don't "stand out" as much when there are older items that are more urgent.   One thing that does help mitigate this is to do things early and often.  Every "old" item was at one time "new" and I find that working early and often helps keep items from becoming a crisis later.   When this is not possible, I trust that my intuition/rational mind will drive me up the list where necessary.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 June 2009 at 19:37 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Chris,<br><br>Yeah, but I don't work that way.  If it is out of sight, it is out of mind ... unless URGENT.  But many important things are not urgent and so can be overlooked.<br><br>Bob,<br><br>I have thought of that, or just using my "index card" for "on notice" as well as "hot" items I need to do today.  OTOH, if you just keep going back to the front of the list where those "on notice" items live, you'll see them there anyway.  You just have to remember to continually go back, it seems.  Or I suppose you could use the Post-it flags idea mentioned elsewhere.  (Debs, maybe?)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 12:15 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt; I was wondering if during the morning scan, you moved your urgent items that appear on the older pages to the last page would help? &gt;&gt;<br><br>Huh, I just did that this morning. But I'm wondering if I should avoid the temptation. I'm confused. What is the difference between adding new items to the list vs moving old items to the start of the list as they become "must do" items?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 13:20 | Avrum</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum,<br><br>I'm not sure.  I think you'd have to identify them as "on notice" so they were not simply perpetually reactivated.  You'd have no dismissal then.  But it does seem an option to me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 13:23 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thinking more about that, I'd be tempted to rewrite the "on notice" items in red pen very slowly while thinking about their wording and the reason I really think they need to be done today.  Make it a sort of ritual.  It would also make a nice divider between today's and yesterday's tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 13:25 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&gt;&gt; they were not simply perpetually reactivated &gt;&gt;<br><br>Worse, what if I keep placing "surf the net" as my activity.

But if you keep doing that, you probably have decided intuitively that websurfing is your most important activity. Then when at some point in time you review all your dismissed items, you may start to wonder if it really IS your most important activity...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 13:45 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>To follow-up on the post-it tags: I've started doing that. A few times a day I have a look at the tagged items, and when I work the list I evaluate the list (not entirely consciously, but it's somewhere in my mind) against these tagged items: is the item I am looking at now important enough to stop my progress towards the end of the list with the tagged items?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 13:47 | Nicole</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I think that if you get in the habit of rearranging your list to match priority, or urgency, then you are not doing Autofocus.  Of course, that is not really what you are doing, maybe.  In Autofocus 1, because of the dismissal rule, we dealt with the problem of an urgent item being possibly 6 pages or more away, by applying Mark's Meta-Rule:  "If you need to do it, do it."   This is less of a problem in AF 2.  I live in Arkansas and it had been getting up to near 100 degrees with very high humidity.  It can be barely livable even at 8:00 in the morning.  There are a number of routine tasks (some that vary) that I really need to get done in the morning.  In AF1, I would have a separate "Outside" list.  IN AF 2 I don't worry so much (at least not yet.)  One of my tasks each morning is to pick ripe fruit and vegetables.  This task was "urgent" this morning at 6:30 but was 20 item down my list.  There were several other outdoor tasks scattered around, and a couple that I only do every other day or so, that by tomorrow may be 30 items down the list.  So what I did this morning was that I moved my dividing line to the next group on notice, read through my list and noticed two things.  I had a group of outdoor tasks, and there were no "urgent" indoor tasks at all.  But still I did read down through each item, fairly quickly (I work top to bottom on my computer screen) until I came to the "Pick fruits and vegetables" item and, not surprisingly, it "stood out."  I did this item, then quickly did two other items outside (without consulting my list) before I came back in.  I reentered the items, then went back to the most recent items and started again.<br><br>Mark has said that in AF 2 any item on the list is potentially actionable.  I suspect this may be what he means.  In theory, you can skip 40 or 50 items without fear of dismissal, if they don't stand out, and something further up the list does.  <br><br>So why not just move those items to the most recent page in the morning?  Specifically, why don't I just move my "outside" tasks to the end of my list each morning?   I think by leaving them where they are, and forcing oneself to at least give a cursory glance at each item as one moves through the list, keeps all items in the mind, which may decrease the chance that they become urgent in a day or two.  There is a definite psychological balance that goes on here, and I don't want to tip it one way or another.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 13:52 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>For urgent items, during the first morning scan of my AF list, (whether in AF1 or AF2 mode), I highlight in Yellow the items that MUST be done today (not the ones that I only want to do today). <br>Then I start my day by doing them, turning the pages in search of only yellow highlighted tasks. Once done with them, I work in AF2 mode, confident that everything old and urgent is taken care of, and that any newly urgent item will be in the end of the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 13:55 | Alex B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum: I think moving things to the end without working on them because of their urgency might not provide the incentive to go further up the list, thus missing out on things that may be less urgent but important. The active filter that you apply to move things gives you ample reason to stay at the end of the list, because you know that all the stuff you need to work on is there.<br><br>For eg, I have a task further up my list that to work on is like pulling teeth, but its really getting important for me to work on it as soon as possible. Moving it to the back might give me further reason to procrastinate, because I know I'll pass through it pretty quickly on my next throwback to the end of the list. <br><br>Just thoughts on my experience: things further up the list provide the uneasy tension I need to get them out of the day or risk some unfavourable outcome.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 13:56 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting thoughts.

At item 63 I couldn't take it any more, had to stop. <br>So that's my limit, at least today, for "keeping all items in the mind":  62 items.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 15:20 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This is the second time this particular suggestion has come up already. My answer is still the same. <br><br>The purpose of keeping the "on-notice" items at the beginning of the list is to give you the incentive to move back through the list. Moving back through the list helps to keep the whole list in your mind. That helps to spread the action you take over the ENTIRE list, instead of just bunching it at the end.<br><br>I know that it takes quite a time to look at all the items from the end of the list to the beginning, but since the earlier items tend to be the weightier, more difficult tasks the time spent is not out of proportion.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 July 2009 at 15:35 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Avrum:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Worse, what if I keep placing "surf the net" as my activity.
