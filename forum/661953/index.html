Any work around or solutionÉ<br><br>Thanks</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 22:55 | H-F</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have been a user of Things, but I must admit that it doesn't put you into the AF mindset since the program (and Omnifocus) rely on giving you customized views of your lists and sublists. Where AF shines in the short time that I have used it is that you are constantly reviewing all of your actions and allowing your brain to pull the items that *Stand Out* (certainly the most powerful aspect of this system). <br><br>Task paper is just about as close to using my Moleskine as it gets, although I am a relative newbie with this program. The idea of "pages" is more difficult to implement since the program will simply keep scrolling as you add to end of the list, and I am not sure how to impose a "line limit" to it. I started playing with it today, and created a separate file for work and home. The "Project" (read: Page) is the date that I start that particular list (I put the date at the top of each of my handwritten pages). After a physical count of my actions, any other action above 32 gets put into a new project (if it's the same day, I followup up the date with a letter eg: 02-12-09 and 02-12-09a [yes, I'm American]). <br><br>If I can find some way for Taskpaper to limit the number of actions to 32 in a Project, I would be extremely happy since the counting step is tedious. Taskpaper is tag-enabled, but I am fleeing from the complexity of Things and Omnifocus, so the only tags I am using are @done (taskpaper throws a nifty date stamp next to this one), @waiting, and @dismissed.<br><br>The most obvious benefit of using Taskpaper over my moleskine is the fact that everything is searchable (eg - when did I pay my property taxes again?). The most obvious downside is that my moleskine is pocketable, and my mac is not. The software developer is currently working on an iPhone app which would solve this dilema. I would be very curious to see how others are using this program with AF. Here is a screenshot for my list today: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7925615@N07/?saved=1">http://www.flickr.com/photos/7925615@N07/?saved=1</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>12 February 2009 at 23:06 | palletguru</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>TaskPaper &amp; AF work great together.

There's also some discussion of using Omnifocus there (which some prefer, but which I haven't tried).<br><br>Things (and Omnifocus) are already available for the iPhone. I work with Things on my laptop most of the time, and use the iPhone only when I'm elsewhere, and it works pretty well for me (still). If you were trying to run AF entirely on the iPhone, though (H-F?), neither of the solutions to the items-per-page problem I described on the other thread would work, so that might be more of a problem.<br><br>Palletguru: If you use Things to do AF in the way I described on the other thread, you can just ignore the more complex options Things gives you; I don't find it any sort of impediment to being in the AF mindset. (My only tags are 'Kate' (things I need to talk to my wife about), 'errand', and 'department' (so I can easily check for things I can only do when I'm at my office, when I am), but the vast majority of my items are untagged.)<br><br>I haven't tried Taskpaper, though, so no comparative claims being made here. Just point out that there are ways of dealing with the items-per-page issue in Things, and that Things can be used in quite a simple and minimal way to implement AF. <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 June 2009 at 19:55 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I red a great article somewhere but i dont remember where and who wrote it.

I have realised that to be fully operationnal i had to show in contexts nothing but the active tasks. Then i work in omnifocus way as i did before.<br>The main difference is about how i make it operational. I found a lot of difficuties about working on my tasks on a computer in omnifocus but also on taskpaper.

Another adavantage is havng it on my iphone so i can update OF in my spare time and advance in my review and planification. <br>Hope this help for OF users...<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 June 2009 at 6:39 | Jupiter</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
