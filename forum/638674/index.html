The Index Card system didn't work for me - apart from the fact that the items that were concerning me were not vital same day but rather tasks that were just assuming a sort of intrusive urgency - having that extra page just didn't seem right somehow, although others have clearly found it works really well for them.<br><br>I have tried two approaches, both of which seem to have worked, and I would be interested in feedback from anyone else who has tried this.  <br><br>One has been to rewrite items that cause concern on my last page (I think someone else mentioned that they had done something similar). That seems to have a number of effects, the act of writing them down again starts the mind working on them but at the same time seems to reduce the concern over them.  It is as if it is reinforcing the fact that those items are most definitely in the system and will be actioned.  It also seems to provide a degree of comfort that they are closer to being actioned and that they will be seen each time anything new is written down.  In that way, if they do become same day urgent then they can be addressed.<br><br>The second approach I have taken is as follows: When reviewing my lists at the end of the day, I have written down on a separate paper any tasks that I feel need to be actioned or have any concern about.  I then just put that paper to one side and forget it.  I don't refer to it with my AF lists (all of the tasks are already in there anyway) although I obviously know it is there if I need it.  Strangely, at the end of the following day most of those tasks will have been progressed.<br><br>I get the impression that it is the act of writing those items down that is the key, and is somehow creating more emphasis within our subconscious but not in a way that produces the level of resistance which any form of a "must do" list seems to generate. <br><br>Both approaches seem to be working for me but I would be interested in any views .......</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2009 at 0:11 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>It's always great reading your thoughts Christine. Very interesting, I was wondering, what times of the day are you working with your AF list. Do you continue working with it  throughout the day and until bed time? <br><br>One of the processes you've reminded me of is the subconscious ability to work on tasks while your attention is elsewhere. Especially while sleeping. While in some books its a 'no-no' to occupy your mind with work activities near bedtime, instructing your subconscious to work on a task just before going to bed can be very effective. <br><br>So my next question was what kind of tasks were you listing as urgent. Tasks that required thinking/problem solving? Or straightforward tasks like 'call mr x'. <br><br>What I find interesting about the idea of pulling out tasks from AF on the side is that they may get extra 'attention' from the subconscious. It could create a similar effect as instructing your subconscious to work on a problem while you sleep. <br><br>Another scenario might be: consider you've just added an urgent item for tomorrow that requires 'thinking time'. You've highlighted by one method. Maybe like you have by rewriting the items, writing them on an indexcard, or writing a special list like your second approach Christine. If now you continue AF on whatever page you were and you pick tasks that allow you to think on the urgent items, like 'doing the dishes' or any other safe routine tasks that don't involve intensive thought, you can 'prepave' by thinking on your urgent items while doing the more mundane routine tasks. <br><br>To give an example, I might do some household tasks while preparing a reply to an important email. <br><br>Strategic Autofocus at it's best!<br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2009 at 3:27 | Peter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Christine,<br><br>Maybe it would be a good idea, in the end-of-day review, or maybe at start-of-day, to actually list those items that you feel are "urgent" at the end of the AF list, rather than on a separate page.<br><br>That way, you get the act of writing to reinforce your subconscious, but you also get the double effect of having them show up (perhaps repeatedly) in your AF list.<br><br>I find that the tasks I am most worried about have shown up in multiple places in my AF list.  I can't remember if I wrote them down already, or in some cases just want to be extra sure to get the task done.  If I come across the task more frequently as I work the list, it gives me that many more opportunities to move the task forward.<br><br>Well, I will try this, and let you know how it goes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2009 at 5:28 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>DOH, I just re-read your post (Christine), and realized you had already tried the exact thing I was describing.  I need to read more carefully next time!  <br><br>Sorry about that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>23 January 2009 at 5:29 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim<br><br>I'm glad you came up with the same idea as well (and I don't blame you for missing it on first read - my posts are often quite long!) I think it does reinforce the item/s and I don't worry about there being duplicate items - I think when the lists grow a bit (which mine have!) then it is inevitable.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2009 at 20:49 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Peter<br><br>Glad you enjoy my posts - thanks!  The time I am working on the lists varies.  I have quite an odd structure to my week as I have a lot of demands on my time with elderly parents with health needs.  Generally I find that I am working on my lists until late into the evening and the interesting thing with AF is that working on them doesn't feel like work so I don't generally have the same levels of anxiety.  Also I tend to catch up on the forum last thing but that tends to generate a more thoughts about how the system works rather than thinking about the items themselves.  I am most definately finding that I am coming up with ideas etc whilst doing mundane tasks.  Rather than be internally grumbling about having to do whatever I am doing I am actively planning other things, with the result that the task I would have grumbled about just gets done almost literally without thinking about it.<br><br>I have just been away for the weekend and was talking about AF to the friend I was with who looked at me in amazement when I said I was actually looking forward to doing my VAT returns this week.  Now how weird is that?!! <br><br>So far the tasks that I have pulled out have been more complex tasks so I guess that I am thinking about them subconsciously overnight.  I think there are so many nuances to AF coming out as we go along - I certainly had not anticipated the amazing way in which my mind seems to focus more easily and recognise reasons for resistance almost instantly now.  Long may it continue ........</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 January 2009 at 21:04 | Christine B</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
