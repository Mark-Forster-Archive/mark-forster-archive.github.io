However, I've added a recurring item - 'Process day list' - which consists of the following steps.<br><br>1. scan through the AF list and make a note on a separate piece of paper (usually the back of an old envelope) of the few things that are important or urgent enough to warrant it.<br><br>2. Add any other time sensitive stuff if necessary, like visits, calls, errands etc.<br><br>3. work through the shorter day list for as long as I can stick it or until I've got the stuff that needs to be done today finished.<br><br>4. Go back to the AF list and process as normal,  potentially going back to the day list (because its a recurring item on the AF list).<br><br>For me, this has a couple of benefits.   <br><br>* It reduces distraction or the danger of cherry picking the simple stuff.  <br>* It also allows me to use the 'burst mode' approach that Mark described in Get Everything Done.<br>* Its a great way of using all those junk mail envelopes that would otherwise go straight into recycle.<br>* As I tend to travel a fair bit with the job, it allows me to build more structure into my working life.<br><br>Comments anyone?<br><br>Dave</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 23:19 | Dave</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Yup, that is exactly how I've done AF since the days of AF1.  I think of it this way:<br><br>- AF is my collection point<br>- My "today" list is my "key" TM tool<br>- I process the AF list only when I am finished the "today" list or can't proceed for the moment<br><br>I also use a system of "focus areas" to help guide what I cull from the list.  IOW, this week I am focused on cleaning up shopping for the holidays so anything that supports that gets priority.<br><br>It is a very effective way of keeping focused on what needs to get done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 December 2009 at 23:27 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Though I call the items on my "today list"  my "most important tasks" (MITs, Zen Habits), and though I write my today list in my diary, my usage of AF is the same like Mike's.<br><br>"Areas of focus" with feasible goals have proven to be very helpful, too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2009 at 8:50 | Rainer</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF4 is indeed fantastic for having a big list of all actionable things but i am right with you for focus on today list it is not easy. I didn't find one solution but 2.<br><br>Solution 1 :<br>1. extract on a paper sheet a mini autofocus list from Omnifocus (my project manager and tickler)<br>2. Add what is actionable on AF4<br>Result for me &gt; It takes time, it cut the dynamical process of AF4, sometime nothing advance. <br>But it help me focus on what are my essential priorities<br><br>Solution 2<br>1. Extract on AF4 from omnifocus all activable things and report them on AF4 if there aren't there. During the day let AF4 fill with everything which happens  and write it on the active list.<br>2. Take a paper pencil, read one the all AF4 and put a .dot in front of everything which must absolutly be done first. If you have some phone calls have eventuelly a call list with all the subjects you have to talk with people<br>3. Then do first the .dot<br>4. Then follow af4 <br><br>For me it works but my AF4 is not very long 2 pages because all non actionable things are reported on omnifocus project by project and cross on AF4 excep if they are waiting items incoming in the next 2 days. I must admit that i have also during the all day a project list on my desk which never leave me with all my essential projects.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2009 at 9:38 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A couple questions:<br><br>1. When you extract your tasks from the master list, do you cross them off ? When you stop working on the short list, do you re-enter the unactioned tasks to the open area of the master list?<br><br>2. Do you process your sub-list using AF rules? If so, when you work on a task but not finish it, do you re-enter it at the end of the short list, or at the end of the master list?<br><br>Thanks,</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2009 at 16:44 | Walter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Walter,<br><br>I view it this way:  I only pull things off the AF list that I really NEED to do.  So the idea of not finishing them, putting them back on the list, and working on them again and again does not apply.  I don't cross them off until I actually complete them, but I also don't put them back on the list ... I just get them done.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2009 at 17:26 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I find that AF4 works fine "as written" for my needs 95% of the time.  But if I'm away from the list for a few days (illness or travel or whatever), I do this:<br><br>(1) Go through the whole AF4 list from beginning to end and move any "pressing" items to the end of the Open List.  This takes about 10-15 minutes, sometimes less, since my total page count tends to stay around 10-12.<br><br>(2) After I'm done with (1), I start working through the Open List.  From this point I just follow the normal AF4 rules.<br><br>(3) If those "pressing" items are still really "pressing", I find myself skipping through the items on the Open List till I come to the first of those "pressing" items.  And then I just work through those as normal.<br><br>Works great.  <br><br>I prefer this over a separate "daily" list because it's too easy for that single daily list to become a list of daily lists and then you're back to piles of scraps of lists and stickies and stuff.  At least that's what would usually happen to me.  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2009 at 23:48 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I do something very similar.<br><br>Walter:<br><br>1) When I copy a task, I put a dot next to the item. When I return to the master list, I cross it out. If the task was not completed, I re-enter it. <br><br>2) Whether I apply AF rules to the sublist, depends on how large list might grow while I am away from the master. Usually, I only have ten or fewer items on the sub-list at a time. But if I get caught up away from master list for most of the day and a lot of new tasks arise, I start applying the typical AF rules for that list.<br><br>Also, I re-enter everything from my sub-list to the master once I return to it, even if it is a task that appeared and was completed without ever entering the master list. Keeping as many tasks worked on as possible on my master list gives me a simple record of when things were done and I believe allows me to be more confident in doing the task which stands out. <br><br>Hope this helps. Good luck.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 December 2009 at 23:58 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I extract the next half-day's tasks into a separate list, for the reasons of focus/distraction minimisation that others have mentioned.  But though it has these advantages, it has one disadvantage.  <br><br>The mood that you have now may not be the mood that you have in a couple of hours' time.  One of the ways AF keeps productivity high is that it keeps you doing at least something, rather than messing about.  In objective terms, the something that you are doing may not be the most lucrative, or important; but it's better than spinning wheels, if that is what would otherwise happen at that moment.  In due course, your mood will change, and your subconscious process will naturally pick out more valuable things to be doing.<br><br>I think that this characteristic of AF is lost with a "today's task list".  I've found a half day list a reasonable compromise.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 December 2009 at 9:35 | David C</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Interesting, thanks for the answers.<br><br>I try to follow the rules, but do a full scan of the list before starting.<br><br>Should the system include some native method to deal with pressing tasks?<br>AF2/3 addressed that. Was that enough?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 December 2009 at 14:56 | Walter</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
