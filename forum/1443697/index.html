Also, I assume you just move all the "active" tasks that are dismissed to the Dismissed folder.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 March 2011 at 3:29 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Sarah you gave me a fantastic idea about contexts. With Gtd I alway had some problem with this because i used the wrong contexts. Ie @Call (I have a phone every where) @Mail I have a mail everywhere. Seeing your demo on toodledo let me realized suddenly at a glance that i could organize it differently. Instead I could do it about what i really do then they became <br>@Strategy (when I work about the strategy of my company), @Négociate (when I focus on my negociation, @Backing (when I consolidate my negociation ex making a contract), @prospect (when I try to find new clients or new buidings) @Organize (When I organize my stuff) @Leaning (when I take time to learn things) @Playing (When I take time to play) @Family (when I do something about my family) @Errands (when I buy things)<br><br>I know it's just GTD but since then I never did it like this and I admit it's incredible efficient because it's the way I work.

I decided to give this method a try. I have pretty much kept your setup intact. I am thinking of using the Star to mark the task that's in progress if I decide to step out. The one thing that I am a bit confused is that when I refresh the page after any changes (task completed etc.), the sort seems to change the order of some of the tasks (btw, tasks sorted by priority within a page). I didn't notice that in your demo. But, have you seen this issue? Or is there another setup that I am missing? Thanks again for your help.<br><br>GC</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2011 at 3:09 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>DS- pages are 25 items long. Unfortunately I haven't found a good way to keep track of this other than just counting. I can usually tell when it's getting close, though.<br><br>GC- I don't know why it would be changing your sort order... I've never noticed it changing mine.  My sorts are (I believe) priority and then date added.

I also use the "Starred" subtab, to see my current task (that I star), and two special starred tasks "**Start**" and "**Top**" that I use to record what page I started on for the day, and what page is the top and when I get to it (still only getting about 1 cycle per day).<br><br>I do have "tags" field active that I may use for projects, but haven't done so.

I was looking at a low overhead electronic implementation and thanks to Sarah's Toodledo demo, I think I have it. I have used this for 3 weeks and I think I finally have something that's working for me very well. So for those who might be interested --<br><br>My setup:<br><br>As with sabre23t, I use the priority levels to distinguish contexts and Columns:<br>3 Top -- C2<br>2 High -- C1, Errands<br>1 Medium -- C1, Work<br>0 Low -- C1, Home<br><br>Pages in Folders -- Sorted by "Priority : Forwards" and "Date Added : Reverse". This setting keeps the C2 items on the top and C1 items below. So, I always look at C2 items before I move on to C1 items. <br><br>I tried a few other settings but discarded them as the overhead became too high.<br><br>When the total number of tasks in Priority 0, 1 and 2 (basically C1 tasks) reaches 20, I rename the folder to show that it is closed and no C1 tasks can be added to the page -- Example: Page1 becomes Page1C. My C2 count is pretty small and I keep this to a minimum. C2 creates a ton of resistance for me unless they are really urgent. But, I do like the flexibility of having urgent tasks in C2 as part of the workflow. I try to breakdown the tasks to bite sized chunks so that it can be completed in one sitting and the next task in a project goes to C1. This has kept the C2 to very small in number (at the most 5). As ubi mentions in a separate thread, this has been working for me well. <br><br>The workflow is very similar to what you see in Sarah's demo. The one addition is that I mark a task with star to show that the task is being worked on.<br><br>I have a "Dismissed" Folder. When a page gets dismissed, all the tasks from the page is moved to this folder. I do have a recurring task "Review Dismissed Items" so I can check on them regularly. If I feel any of them is ready to be done, I move it back to C1 of the last page.<br><br>Once a page is dismissed or fully completed, it is archived to keep away the clutter.<br><br>I also keep tickler in Toodledo. I have a folder called Tickler and have created a saved search: Recent7d - Tasks overdue last 7 days and due in the next 7 days. I check this everyday to see if any of them needs to be moved SF list. I prefer this because the Outlook I use is work based and I didn't want personal items in there. Any tasks that have a due date goes in here. <br><br>I keep all my projects in Evernote. The next step is always available in Evernote and it gets moved to SF when the previous task is complete. <br><br>I keep my Toodledo and Evernote pinned in my browser. I also have iPhone apps for both Toodledo and Evernote for mobility.<br><br>GC</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>14 April 2011 at 23:27 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt; "Date Added : Reverse" ...

I did that initially but find it a bit too much overhead. I change to sorting by "Date Modified : Forwards", so I don't need to clone partially completed tasks.

I break down the tasks to bite sized chunks that can be done in one sitting - more like the next action from GTD. This keeps the cloning to the minimum. Also, even if the task is modified it will move to the end of the page. But, it needs to move to the "next" page according to the rules. So you need to touch it anyway, right? <br><br>BTW, I am experimenting with the addition of 1 task - "Current page - First C1 task done?". When I come to the page for the first time, I star this task to show that this is the Current page. Then when I finish the first C1 task, I check this task off. When I move off the page, I uncheck the task and un-Star the task. Every page has this task. This is working for now but it hasn't been long enough to hit any corner cases. I got this idea from Mark, to mimic his circle method in toodledo workflow! This seems to be foolproof so far - as long as I get into the habit of checking/unchecking the task properly. <br><br>I have one nit with Toodledo. When I check the task as completed, the task text becomes grey. However, when I refresh the page, the text becomes regular font color again. I am not sure why that happens. Anyone using Toodledo see that?<br><br>GC</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 April 2011 at 19:16 | Greenchutney</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like the "First C1 Task started?" idea - I'm going to have to try that!<br><br>I have noticed the greying out of a recently-checked task but it doesn't bother me.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 April 2011 at 1:40 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Greenchutney said ...<br>&lt;&lt; I break down the tasks to bite sized chunks that can be done in one sitting &gt;&gt;<br><br>Ah, I tend to have many tasks which are just "do a little of".

I was doing similar earlier on, with C2 pages named with additional "a", so typically the sorted folders tab looks like ".01", ".01a", ".02", ".02a" etc. However, I found managing the C2 tasks as separate folders page to have significant overhead. Hence, I've added "priority" field to differentiate C2 and C1 tasks (mentioned earlier). I find it to be less overhead.<br><br> &lt;&lt; My approach to repeating tasks or those that need a bit more work get transferred to their new location by just changing the tab/page label. However, I understand others may wish to see that growing list of completed tasks. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I do so too. Seeing a decreasing list of active (uncompleted) tasks gives me similar motivation. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 April 2011 at 0:20 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I realized I am not using the context field at all. So, I have moved to sorting by Context field instead of priority. If I were using the context field for some other purpose, I would probably stick with priority. So, my setup is now sorted by Context: Reverse and then by Date Added: Reverse and with the following contexts...<br><br>1-Home<br>2-Work<br>3-Errands<br>4-All C2 Tasks<br><br>Now, I don't have to think about how the priority equates to the contexts as they are self-explanatory. If I need project category, I am planning on using the tags.<br><br>I am tempted to use different pages for C1 and C2 tasks. But, the current setup is working very well and so I don't want to jinx it :) Plus, I am using C2 very sparingly, so it may just add to the clutter.
