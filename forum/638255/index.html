His ideas have been really<br>invaluable to me. And I would also like to thank the other testers and<br>commenters on this forum, whose discussions helped me solve some<br>doubts that I have faced in the last days.<br><br>A brief introduction if I may, and enough of lurking around. I am now<br>an PhD student in Astronomy. I found GTD when I was starting having<br>problems writing my Master's thesis and was feeling overwhelmed. My<br>main problem was the stressful feeling I had in the evenings and<br>weekends -- when I was having fun, I had that thought in the back of<br>my mind that I should, in fact, be working on my thesis. GTD made<br>sense for some months. But I was soon stressed with my never-ending<br>lists.<br><br>Then I found DIT, which gave me a great sense of relief by allowing me<br>to call it a day. My problem with DIT, like others have mentioned, was<br>the fact that I was always trying to cut down on my tomorrow's<br>list. So, it ended up being a not very fun list. And I resented that<br>-- when will I have time to allow fun and creative and some personal<br>projects on my list?<br><br>AF to the rescue. I just started this week. I signed up on the first<br>week, but it turned out I had a trip then; second week I had a major<br>personal problem and decided I'd take the week off. This week is the<br>week of the truth!<br><br>So, I took the leap of faith. I started AF with a clean slate. I<br>bought a notebook -- still not working very well, but I will post<br>about this in a moment on this same thread, as this post is already<br>long enough. My week started with my dealing with the red tape in<br>France, which always makes me exhasuted to no end. But I was already<br>fine on Tuesday, hanging on to my AF list. Yesterday I spent most of<br>the day away from the office, finishing off a project. But today I<br>already picked up where I left off.<br><br>So, it is great so far. More relaxed, less paranoia. :) To finish off<br>this post, AF reminded me of something I listened to at Radiolab. This<br>episode called Choice talks about a guy who loses the ability to<br>listen to his gut feeling. He is all rational. But he cannot decide on<br>what box of cereal he should buy. Turns out Spock-like people are<br>terrible at making decisions. And I was proud of being one of those!<br>Anyway, AF is really helping me to trust my gut feelings again. If you<br>want to listen to the segment where this is discussed, it is here:<br><br>***********<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/11/14/segments/113278">http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/11/14/segments/113278</a><br><br>Overcome By Emotion<br><br>Instinct or analysis? Wouldn't things be easier if we could get<br>emotion out of the way and let rational analysis lead? Except that so<br>often, that gut feeling turns out to be right. We explore both<br>extremes. Antoine Bechara, a psychology professor at USC, tells us<br>about the case of Elliot, an accountant who, after having a tumor<br>removed from his brain, became entirely rational.<br>***********<br><br>I'll be back on this thread in a few minutes.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 January 2009 at 17:45 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I see the last post is a bit hard to read because of the line breaks,. I will try to mend things on this one.<br><br>First topic I wanted to comment was the notebook choice. Although I prefer text files on my computer for many things (e.g., GTD and DIT where partially implemented with them), I just could not see how a digital system would be any better than pen and paper. Oh, note: I use a pencil -- not a mechanical pencil, not a pen -- a simple and soft pencil. I get distracted when the ink on a page is different, and I dislike mechanical pencils, so pencils are always my first choice.<br><br>My first attempt (week #1) was to recycle a small Moleskine diary from last year, as it had many blank pages. It had 19 lines, and the lines were too small to write things. As someone already said, AF, to me, requires more writing space than DIT, because some tasks hang around for more time so it is nicer to have them more spelled out.<br><br>I then searched for a A5 notebook. I ended up with A5 graph paper notebook. I really prefer lined paper, but I thought it would be OK, as I have been using graph paper on and off. Pros: because the boxes are smallish, there are many lines on each page. I use 37 lines, but there are, in fact, 41. Had it been 42, I would have seriously considered filling out all of them. :) But I leave 4 blank lines on top of each bage to mark when a page is closed.<br><br>So, first day (week #3, week #2 I was off work) I started listing my taks, line by line. It got really croweded, even with my small-ish writing, so I thought: why not simply skip a line between entries? That way, it was much easier to read and see what had been crossed. The problem was that I had then only 19 lines per page, as I was skipping every other line.<br><br>I realised this would not work -- I saw it myself with the small moleskine, and I also read Mark's reasons to recommend 30-40 lines per page. So back to using all lines I went. I also felt better about not wasting half of my notebook skipping lines.<br><br>But it got very croweded again, and I noticed today, as I have a lot of completed items (yay!, but still none dismissed), I was not notincing some items because of how croweded the pages have become.<br><br>So, I got a A4 lined-paper pad (Rhodia, top-flip) I had lying around and will test it. It is has 36 lines. I will keep using both, as I am very lazy to transfer the items on the A5 notebook to the A4.<br><br>A nice side-effect I noticed: my writing is getting clearer now, as I am getting more practice during the day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 January 2009 at 17:47 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Last comment after my almost-a-week experiment with AF. I had a great feeling today when I cycled back to my last page. There I had listed many routine things, but I had also rewritten tasks on which I worked a bit today, and had been resisting starting for some time. You know, the last page, the open page, where most of the action is supposed to be, is a great motivation to keep using AF! "Look at what you have done today! Way to go!", it screams at me. I hope it keeps going this way. :)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 January 2009 at 17:50 | Natalia</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Natalia,<br><br>thanks for sharing your experiences.
