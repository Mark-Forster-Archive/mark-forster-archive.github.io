They don't want to cut my hours back to part-time because they're an institution and they would lose the budget next year when I'm gone.  <br><br>So do I drag the day out, or do what I have been doing and try to finish my work off in the morning and basically play around on the internet, do my personal business and visit with people in the afternoon?  If anyone else in my department was overloaded, I would offer to help them out, but a) they do very different work from me and b) they don't seem any busier than me - all leave promptly at quitting time and seem to take a lot of sick days to boot.  There's one lady that works a lot, but she seems to do it because she doesn't have anything else to do outside of work.<br><br>This all feels wrong to me though.  It's wrong to drag the day out, it's wrong to do a bunch of personal stuff at work.

But generally speaking if you have to be there then find some project that you can do while you are there. You say that you generally finish your work in the morning. I guess that leaves you with about 3-4 hours to fill in. That's about the amount of time needed to become a real expert at something. So the question to ask yourself is "What would be most beneficial to me or my work if I spent four hours a day on it?"</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 June 2009 at 7:58 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mel:<br><br>I dealt with this subject extensively in my first book "Get Everything Done". I called it the "end effect".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 June 2009 at 8:00 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>GED does cover this topic and very well too.  More from the perspective of people who feel they have too much to do though.<br><br>I bet the problem of not having enough work to do is very common.  I've certainly run across this problem almost everywhere I've worked.  People need to be busy and challenged to feel fulfilled.  <br><br>At a contract job I had one job prior to this, I had the same problem, only they agreed to let me work part time.  The staff would complain to each other that they were bored and didn't have enough to do, but they wouldn't ask the manager for more work.  If they did, she'd say 'just enjoy the down-time, we'll be super busy later."  Fortunately, the manager left shortly thereafter, I took over her job, we had some attrition without re-hiring so less people and a system upgrade so more work came, and we got to re-work the pattern of how everyone worked to reduce those downtimes.  <br><br>I think my perspective has changed because I'm only at this job for 6 more months.  It seems silly to work my butt off here trying to become an expert at fund accounting (especially since I don't like fund accounting).  Or start writing that novel... just kidding! :-)<br><br>They have a lot of "shared positions" here and I should request to be shared with and work part time with another, central department.  I can then make more contacts so that just in case I ever want to do some contract work in the future, I know more people.  <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 June 2009 at 13:17 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Jacqueline<br>I've NEVER, EVER had a job with not enough work.  I can't even imagine the sensation of slacking off on another person's dime!  What was I missing all these decades?  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 June 2009 at 15:11 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Learning:<br><br>I've certainly been in that position and it is far more soul-destroying than having too much work. In my case, and I think a lot of other people too, it certainly didn't have anything to do with slacking off. It's often a question of politics, as in Jacqueline's case about losing the budget. In my case it was literally politics - it was Margaret Thatcher's instruction that Government Departments should incur no new expenditure for the remaining six months of the year. Since my job concerned new expenditure I literally had no work to do at all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 June 2009 at 19:13 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I often found on returning from holiday that projects I worked hard on just before going away haven't moved on at all making me wonder whether it was worth the effort.    <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 June 2009 at 19:43 | Man of Kent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark<br>I didn't mean to insinuate that she initiated the idea to slack off.

It was so disheartening to see that when the cuts came through they eliminated the positions of people who were actually working and kept the seat warmers.

Wouldn't it be quicker to get it through amazon.co.uk ?

I'd check my local library first though.  Nowadays, they have inter-library loan and will source books from anywhere in the province/state in most areas of the country.  Your library might not have the book, but others will.  <br><br>Mel, I can pdf you some dog-eared pages while you wait for your copy (if that's ok Mark).  But contrary to a lot of books, the dog ears are scattered throughout the book.  :-)<br><br>learning, I've found that most managers don't really know what their people DO or how they do it (often because they've never done the job of the people they're managing), so have no idea of how long things should take to do.  They don't actively manage or sit down with their people on a regular basis to find out what's on their plates either and maybe help them re-prioritize or cut out some steps that they shouldn't be doing.  Then when someone leaves, they're hooped.<br><br>Mark, I have thought of doing something like that - but it would have to be "The Autofocused House", then in 6 months, "The Autofocused Sabbatical."  :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 June 2009 at 14:17 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A "trick" I sometimes use just before I go on leave (and at other times when I just get fed up with drifting through the day) is to say to myself "if I could only do one task and then had to go home what would it be"  I know this is isn't true AF, but sometimes it's the only thing that helps me get things done.<br><br>...
