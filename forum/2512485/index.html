I wrote a wooba's thread, and the one about colors (I dont remember who gave this great idea) and DIT. I tried to optimize the system and did a mixt.<br><br>The result was very interesting and efficient. <br><br>It is a very easy system. Any one can do it with paper and a 4 color pen. <br>It is fast and force you to focus on what you really want to do. There is no question, no algorhythme, no process here is how it works <br><br>I indeed thanks everyone for your ideas. I did not invent anything. In only took what I thought some best ideas and did one method around it. <br><br>You will need <br>a paper notebook <br>a 4 color pencil <br>Your attention and your brain <br><br>You will need to choose one color per day.<br>We are thursday the chosen color is blue. <br><br>Making &amp; starting <br>1. Do one long list of everything which comes to your mind in blue (today's color) <br>2. Write everything one after the other it can be ideas, projects, someday may be <br><br>What if ?<br>- If you plan to do it tomorrow, or if it is something new coming today which can wait, write it in red, it will be your tommorow list. <br><br>- If something must be done or could be done later than tomorrow (we, monday....) write it in another color let’s say for the we green and set a date at the end of the task (ie 06/18)<br><br>- If you dont know what day to do it,  write it in blue (the day’s color) the system will sort it anyway...<br><br>- If something is indeed important or so urgent highline it in yellow and do it asap or follow it...<br><br>So your list is complete, and your system operational. <br><br>Acting <br> use wooba’s system. For memory :<br><br>"Write a list. Everything goes on the list (but see notes below). Work the list in order. You cannot skip an item, but you have options for each item:<br><br>1. Cross it off<br>2. Do it and cross it off<br>3. Do some of it, cross it off and rewrite at the end of the list<br>4. Schedule it on calendar and cross it off<br>5. Don’t do it, but cross it off, split it into two new tasks and write them at the end of the list"<br><br>Except reading the list jump on colors that matter (avoid the red it is for tomorrow) avoid the green it is for later) <br><br>Begin by the back log (ie black for monday and tuesday, blue for wednesday and thursday. <br><br>Tomorrow morning begin with the highlined tasks (the most imprtant or urgent) and the red one (your wednesday list) dont do others tasks before having done the red one or the highlined. If you have finished go back to the back log and do it one by one...<br><br>So try this and tell me how it works for you if it does (LOL)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 June 2015 at 16:50 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here is an example about what happened today <br><br>I decided to make a convention <br>Black is Monday and tuesday<br>blue is wednesday and thursday<br>red is wednesday <br>green is for the week end<br>If I dont know I put it in the day'color<br><br>So, <br>I woke up and wrote new items - Today is wednesday so the chosen color is red.<br><br>I wrote in the left marge today's date so it appears ike this 06/12 Make exercises about concentration <br><br>So I have in front of me a long list full of<br>Black items (monday &amp; tuesday) <br>Blue items (wednesday and thursday) <br>Red items friday (today) <br>green items (saturday and sunday) <br>Some are highlined <br><br>action ! <br>- I began on monday (black item and skip all green (saturday and sunday) <br>- I red them one by one, eliminate, report on my diary some as wooba said<br>ie blue I decided to do one immedialtly so I did it<br>Red dit it also<br>Red idem <br>Blue reported monday (black) <br>Red done<br>black skiped<br>red done <br>blue done <br>blue erased <br><br>I arrived on yesterday list <br>blue I dont know so skiped (dismiss)<br>red done <br>blue reported wednesday blue <br>red done <br>red unfinished so at the end of the list green (I will do it this week end) <br><br>I am now on today's list <br>there is one green I skip <br>there is one red (I wrote it this morning intending to do it today) now it is done <br>The is one black I skip (monday or tusday)<br>There is one black with a big date 06/6 I report it on my diary and fix 1 hour to do it it is a pitch. <br><br>Now it is 9:30 and all red items are finished.

Ifound a black (monday and tuesday last week) i reported it at the end of the day in green. Nothing else was actionable except the greens. <br><br>So I red all the green one by one. I reported one on my diary for monday. It is a difficult project so I decided to do it at 9 Am next monday like an appointment.  I also crossed 3 green unusefull items. <br><br>One was to do now it was go running. So I went running and I perfectly know now what I want to do today and the time it will take. My priorities are fixed. <br><br>I discover that the system maked a perfect daily list automaticaly.If something is missing my brain add it automaticaly during my morning review <br><br>The system is still very adictive. I decide to use the same color than tasks for notes so I immediatly know when it appears. I also added the day in the marge on the day's color such as Monday 8th So I can skip on what is late, now or see what will happen later.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 June 2015 at 11:00 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jupiter,<br><br>Great ideas here - thank you for posting!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>13 June 2015 at 16:34 | tomcal</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Day 4 sunday green <br>5am can't sleep decide working on the list THE SYSTEM IS improved <br>1) procee ADD <br>Began by joting ideas and tasks green <br>Added some notes and ideas  left page about improoving the company <br><br>2) Prepare my day<br>Read the all list in reverso page per page like AF1<br><br>P103<br>Black can do it today reported green <br>Green unvalable crossed<br>Green actionable skiped<br><br>101 red unavalaible crossed<br><br>99 blue decided for monday black<br>Sudently idea about improoving the company decide think monday black dated<br>Green go running diary for i like controling days i go running<br>Blue  (read mf podcast about simplification decide to do it today green ref MF post<br><br>97 black (las monday or tuesday) decided not to do anything but think so dissmiss in the system <br><br>3 ) review of the green go p 101 wednesday <br>One green is non actionable until thursday blue<br>103 one green is finaly un usefull crossed<br>4) planification took diary thought about an apointment reported today i took last night (see mum)<br>Reported a waiting call on monday also took yesterday night and jot some notes about others subjects to speck about with him<br>Quick look on the incoming week will report some block apointment with my self for working on next week project tonight : planed tonight to do it <br><br>Conclusion <br>The system works it force me to do things .

I realize that it is better to pick acording to the numerous pages, the colored items of the day and make a new list adding also what i am thinking of at the moment when i make the list. It can appear simply like this<br>16/06 tueday<br>Xxxxx<br>Tttttt<br>Fffff<br> And i can use the bullet journal technical too.<br>In fact the fv list is like a general list which pre select information for the future and collect tasks and notes (on the other page) <br>Will see how it will be at the end of the week</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>15 June 2015 at 22:19 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One of my last comments about the system about my testimony concerning the system<br><br>Today was a difficult day. Lot of things to do. <br><br>I started my day with today's date Tuesday 16th /06 and jot on black (we are tuesday all I thought about hoping to do it today.I also put some blue items for wednesday and thursday &amp;  red items for friday. At the end of the day including all what happened I had 27 items. I crossed 12 <br><br>Reading the past list I admit that it is like a FVP list.  I have 3 items for tomorrow (blue) <br>There is nothing which really matter before today's date except some tasks I think about. I also fixed my system like the bullet journal https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=59&amp;v=fm15cmYU0IM<br>xhich helped me a lot about collection and future items. <br><br>I can now track the past, collect the present and act on it and anticipate the future. <br><br>So my systems works. In fact it is like a FVP list except that I report at night for the next day what really matter to me which most of the time is of the color's day. I also track projects and see how events and tasks are relative to my agenda monthly, daily, and hourly sometime<br><br>Then I am ok with my action list system. I noticed something strange. looking at the colors made me realize that most of my tasks were note crucial. There is a problem with my tasks acording to my goals whish are badly fixed. <br><br>I will work tomorrow on my goals. I am at the end of a cycle. I am far away from the vision of what I wanted to realize since january.  My system is ok it is my business which is not. Sometime we have to start again some new cycle. This is what I am engaged too now. But we are far away from my initial thread.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 June 2015 at 20:46 | Jupiter</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>we are saturday and so my system is working since the 11th<br><br>Here is how it works now : <br><br>You have some materials (paper)<br>- One is your main list I use a rhodia 96 Page 48 sheets 14,8 X21 cm black  (paper) where I jote ideas, tasks, waiting for items - Dated day per day in the marge. (1)<br>- One is my note book I use a Molekine professionnal but I could use anyother notebook 21X13 it includes notes on the left page and right can be for collection (projects) ie Building X or client X there is a summary at the beginning ie Building X p 34 (it used to include my master list.) niw it also include negociation or check lists (paper)<br>- You have some specific folders ie My objectives or some buidings or some client where I jot anything  (paper) - I work on some everyday<br>- You have your computer with folders, doc emails but it it could be on the web with an ipad and your diary where you put dead lines and control the advancement of your projects…. (Digital) -<br>-I use 2 colors blue for task I want to do from now until one week and black for other tasks. <br><br>For tasks <br>For my discretional time. Read the main list (1) once during this just do what stand at you (ie what you feel like to do) - incousciously I think "what task is worth my time ? the dot what is worth.  So do the stuff one by one. report if unfinished, add at the end if new or interrupted. That is the basic- you may also on busy or crucial days report the items of the day on liste (2) or (3)<br><br>For my day <br>take a sheet of paper it is your CALL list (2)  write all call you intend to do you can take them to help from the main list you intend to do today. (I have many calls) <br><br>Take you List and focus on blue items. <br>chose one project it is you project of the day you can make it in parenthesis ie (PROKECT X) <br><br>Do your calls (2) on by one and project(s), return to your main list (1) when you have discretional time. <br><br>Write on your note book all what happens and jot notes about what you think on one page (right or left always the same) on the other page write projects or collection. Report at the beginning the sumary ie project X Page 23<br><br>If something is complicated open a project  (paper) work on it and make a reference in you project list (note book) <br><br>As you see it is a global simple system. Not really complicated. It is focus on acting. That's all.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 June 2015 at 10:45 | Jupiter</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
