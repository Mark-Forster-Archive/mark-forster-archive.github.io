But in practice, I got stuck, because this just didn't work the way that my mind seems to work.  If the project was "make Christmas happen", I'd feel stressed that I would forget something &amp; that I didn't have a clean mapping between the two lists.  <br><br>With AF2, I notice that with projects that have just started to come into my awareness, I like writing it on my list as a big chunk like "make Christmas happen."  Then as I see it, and start to get ready to move on it, at some natural time &amp; in a natural way, it starts to break itself down.  <br><br>And when I'm really working on something &amp; it's in my present time frame in a specific way, I naturally write things down in a more detailed way, to guide myself through the day &amp; remind myself of things I might forget.  When I was getting ready to go out of town, I used my list to jot down the things like "cancel newspaper" &amp; "charge camera batteries" that I needed to do that day.<br><br>I love that I can do this on one list &amp; not have to manage the mappings between the two.  My intuition seems to just take care of it.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 16:43 | Kathy</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>AF, GtD, and classic project management approach this in very different ways:<br><br>- Project Management: Plan EVERY step in advance<br>- GtD: Plan ONLY the next step in advance<br>- AF: Plan NOTHING in advance<br><br>Your milage really does vary on this point.  ;-)  How much you plan depends on how familiar you are with the project, how important its success is, what is the price of failure, etc.<br><br>As to chunk size, that is a slightly different thing (bu really closely connected) to planning the number of steps.  Chunk size often has its most important impact on procrastination.  Too large a chunk and one can feel overwhelmed by the size and complexity of tasks; too small and one can also feel overwhelmed -- but in this case by the sheer number of things in front of one.  It pays to balance those too extremes of chunk size ... and I think we tend to do that naturally.  But the moment something feels overwhelming because of its size, it probably pays to try chunking it down.  Likewise the moment one feels that there are just "too many things to do", it probably pays to chunk it up so that there are only a few projects in front of one.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 18:27 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>&lt;&lt; - AF: Plan NOTHING in advance &gt;&gt;<br><br>I'd be interested to know where you got that idea from.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 19:28 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>As I said (largely because I anticipated your response):<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Your milage really does vary on this point. ;-) &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>And our mileage really vary.  But I'm agreeing with you, in different language ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 20:21 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This last week, seeing that I hadn't made the progress on my bathroom that I would like to have (it still felt overwhelming to me), I wrote up my project plan for the renovation on my AF list.  I hadn't done anything like this since my Flylady dump debacle where I ended up dismissing the whole thing (because I realized most of them were unrealistic given the amount of time I want to spend - or not spend - cleaning).   I ended up with a page of 20 tasks that should almost get the job done.  Just seeing that list of 20 things to do on one page, nothing that will take more than an hour, is a huge motivator.  I should also say that until I had found a picture of exactly what I wanted to do in my bathroom, I felt overwhelmed and was very indecisive in terms of materials, colours, etc., which was mostly why I wasn't getting anything done on it.<br><br>Having them on one page means that if I am following AF1, I have no option to skip any of the items without saying to myself that I'm not renovating the bathroom at all.   That has been a good help vs. having items scattered throughout my pages.<br><br>For some reason writing them out on a separate project list as I had before didn't seem to work to get me wanting to work on them.  I think my book might have magical powers.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>24 July 2009 at 20:49 | Jacqueline</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
