I write in pencil so that I can just erase as I only have 30ish lines on my moleskine weekly daytimer.  It also keeps the list short (due to chunking / grouping tasks vs. listing every little thing) as I have this overwhelm problem if I have a big list.<br><br>I also don't operate it as a "will do" but dismiss a la AF1.  Also don't cross it off and rewrite if I work on one of the projects a little bit during the week but don't finish it, but leave it on and just put a check mark beside it if I touched it that week.  No checkmark, no carry forward.

Almost everybody tried AF1, AF2, but few still use those.  Only 66% tried DWM, but 51% are still using it.

And they probably indicate that it's not a good idea to judge a method until you've tried it.

However, since late March, I have been 100% paper and pen and like it, to the extent I have largely forgotten some of the features and advantages of AF1 - AF4!  Is there a table somewhere showing AF1 vs AF2 etc to AF4, or maybe AFn&gt;<br><br>Having initially said I was NOT looking forward to your current work-in-progress, I am more receptive to seeing it now.

For myself, I find using software makes all the difference, but obviously most people are getting by well enough with paper.<br><br>I experimented for a little while with scanning till a task stands out, and then scanning further till one stands out more. This seemed to select tasks better, but it made the system feel more complex, so I went back to the original way, which feels better.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 May 2010 at 22:31 | Laurence</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>i thought I'd delurk to make one personal observation about my experience with question 4.  At least in my case, when I read the question, I mistakenly answered no because I currently use DWM and the wording said "in the past."  Once I submitted with a fast-twitch mouse click, it was too late to go back and change my answer.

I wonder if there is a away to factor in how long the systems have been around.  IOW, the number for DWM is less impressive to me because it is very new and people have not had enough time for frustration to build.<br><br>Another factor is that some of us have switched BACK to a  previous system.  I'm not sure how you'd express that.<br><br>Finally, it might be interesting to Mark to know how many people have dropped ALL of his systems ... probably a small number, but there are some.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 May 2010 at 11:27 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Also, DWM is the latest, and I think people use that because "it's new, so it must be better", and at some level most of these systems work it's just a question of persistence and community support.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 May 2010 at 12:59 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Alan,<br><br>There seems to be a Primacy-Recency effect here.

So constant switchers will dilute the AF numbers, and strengthen those for DWM. <br>In addition, the May 4 numbers show that the majority *has* been through all of the AFs. <br>Regarding DIT: Given that DIT has been around the longest and wasn't made available on this website only, but also distributed by the book, it should be the system that has been tried by many more people than the others. Most DIT users, whether satisfied with the system and still using it or not, will not have taken the poll. Most will not even know it. Someone who tried DIT a long time ago and abandoned it, might not be visiting this website anymore. <br><br>So this "retention rate" thing is probably moot. <br><br>BTW: It would be nice if the additional comments (personal tweaks etc.) from the poll could be made available als well.<br><br>Just my 2p, and now back to re-starting DWM...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 May 2010 at 13:34 | Alex W.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Oops, just noticed that "by the book" probably means somthing different than what I wanted to say.
