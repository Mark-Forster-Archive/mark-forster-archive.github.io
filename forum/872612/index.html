I’m a college professor and counselor for aging families. My vision is to shift the paradigm about the way we think about aging, caregiving and aging families issues. Between now and 9/8, I have 14 lessons to plan for a class on managing behavioral and emotional issues of elders. I have all of the topics laid out, folders created, stacks of books on my dining room table and tons of internet resources bookmarked. I’m a master at gathering extremely relevant resources and mining fresh ideas for how to approach and think about issues. Now, here is the challenge – preparing the actual lesson plans, is a linear process and I’m a systems-thinker. I would be most grateful for any feedback on how to get through the eye of the needle to have 14 lessons prepared so that I can deliver these lectures. BTW, the reason I would like to prepare the lessons in advance is that I’m also studying for a clinical licensing exam, marketing for my practice, seeing clients, and maintaining a blog. THANK YOU very much for listening. Kind regards, Bev</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 16:13 | Bev P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bev:<br><br>There are two ways of doing a task like this:<br><br>1) Do one lesson plan at a time.<br><br>or<br><br>2) Divide the making of a lesson plan up into steps, then do Step 1 for each of the 14 plans, then Step 2, and so on.<br><br>Method 2 is more mechanical and as such requires less investment of energy, so you may find it provokes less resistance in you.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 16:20 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mr. Forster...thanks so much for your quick reply. I guess when everything is said and done, you are right. The mundane task of doing one thing after another, is perhaps what I've been avoiding. I usually pick up on the next thing to do based on an emotional response of what has my interest most. When it comes to pulling it all together - now that's the challenge. Kind regards,</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 16:34 | Bev P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>PS - If I were to choose option two, with doing the first step for each lesson, etc., what kind of steps would you suggest? Steps I can think of so far are: gather all materials in one folder for each lesson, collect bookmarks etc., make an outline for each lesson, then fill in information where needed. Do you have other other suggestions?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 17:23 | Bev P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mr. Forster, and Bev,<br><br>I just want to remark that it is possible that some (likely not all) of the steps do not have to be sequential. If this is the case, and you choose method #2, you could do Step 1 on Plan 1, then Step 6 on Plan 2, then Step 5 on Plan 1, etc.<br><br>In order to keep track of what needs to be done, you could print out 14 checklists each having all the steps listed. As you accomplish each step for each Plan you check it off.<br><br>The advantage to this is that you neither have to plow through each plan all at once NOR have to do 14 of the same step to every plan all at once. It seems possible that some people, especially those who have many things on their plate, benefit from switching tasks rapidly following the ebb and flow of their energy level/interest.<br><br>--Joseph</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 17:39 | Joseph</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Joseph - I think your idea is a good one and I will use it. I'm also wondering if there is not a more systemic approach to the whole project. I Googled (actually "Bing"ed) the topic "systems approach to prepare college lessons". I came up with a systems approach to designing online learning activities. I think I'm missing the objective for each lesson (which may help me pull the material together from more of a wholistic perspective). If I focus on the objective for the lesson and the experiences and activities/media students need to achieve the objective, this might help. I'm going to work on this a bit and see what happens...There's too much that I want to communicate at this point to begin with a linear approach. How to bring it all together is the challenge.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 18:00 | Bev P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Joseph and Bev:<br><br>The point about doing Step 1 for each lesson in turn is that it's much quicker and more efficient. It's like batching up all your emails, phone calls, etc. <br><br>As far as what steps you should use in the process is concerned, the basic principle is keep the steps as small as possible.<br><br>I did however assume in my answer that you knew what you wanted to go into each lesson. But your latest post suggests that is not the case. <br><br>You said in your first post that it was a linear approach that was needed and now you are saying that a linear approach is not what you want. Are you sure that this is not just a way of avoiding actually getting down to writing the plans? My gut feeling is that you should write the plans first and only then do any additional research that you need to perfect them. Otherwise you could be researching them to death.<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 18:14 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mr. Forster – you are very kind to continue to clarify this problem. Often I find that in struggling to put language to a problem, I learn more about what the components of the problem actually are. I appreciate your letting me use this forum to do so.<br><br>You said that I noted in my first post that I was looking for a linear approach. In fact, I was merely stating that “preparing the actual lesson plans, is a linear process and I’m a systems-thinker”. Implied in my comment was a request for a systems approach to planning the lessons. I realize I may not have been very clear about that.<br><br>Mr. Forster, your gut feeling of “write the plans first and only then do any additional research that you need to perfect them” is right on and my college friend would be agreeing with you wholeheartedly. She would always said, after I researched a topic to death, and was having a hard time wrapping up a paper, “Did you answer the questions for the assignment?” <br><br>Well, as it turns out the very gift/fault of being a systems-thinker enables me to make connections that others may not see. My usual approach to a large project is to cast a wide net and to go as far wide as I can to gather all outlying ideas and new perspectives. Only then do I gradually come back to the beginning. I don’t know if anybody works this way. <br><br>You also said that you assume in my answer that I knew what I wanted to go into each lesson. But that my latest post suggests that is not the case. In fact, I have all of the information on hand, in one form or another, and mentioned that in the first post.<br><br>Maybe I’m deluding myself but I’m going to keep working on a way to bring the information together that fits my way of thinking. Just thought I might find some systems thinkers out there who have addressed this kind of challenge.<br><br>Until then, thanks for giving this a shot. And I hope I didn’t wear you out with my meanderings.<br><br>I’ll post any solution I might come up with otherwise.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 21:13 | Bev P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Far and away the best tool I've come across for thinking out projects like these is a mindmap program. I use Mindjet mindmanager and have been able to pull off some bigger projects in large part because of this brilliant mindmapping program. You get to organize ideas as linear or nonlinear as you like. And it is much faster than trying to work with one sheet of paper at a time or going at it from a to z. With mindmanager you can even do a lot of basic word processing inside the program, and work with all kinds of information sources, links, images, tables, etc. <br><br>I turned my partner to it (she's a teacher) and loves using it to organize her lessons. If you need to organize information it's in my opinion the best way to go about it. <br><br>I think working sequentially is great if you have trouble starting but in a lot of cases the more brain friendly and efficient way is by starting where your mind feels like going first, or what seems like the best place to start. (for example starting a thesis research paper at the very beginning of the text is often a bad place to start because it's function is to lead in to the rest of the paper (which is hard to do properly if the rest of the text is not written yet!)).<br><br>If you use a tool like mindmapping, you can stay organized working this way.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 21:21 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks Peter. Yes, I used XMIND to map out a lot of projects. I put this aside of late but will take another look at processing some of this material for the lessons via mindmapping. Appreciate your post.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>25 August 2009 at 23:14 | Bev P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bev P:<br><br>&lt;&lt; My usual approach to a large project is to cast a wide net and to go as far wide as I can to gather all outlying ideas and new perspectives. Only then do I gradually come back to the beginning. I don’t know if anybody works this way. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Actually my first thought was "Isn't this the way that everyone works?" <br><br>I'm not quite sure what you mean when you contrast a systems approach with a linear approach. Aren't all systems at root collections of linear processes? It's always possible to isolate a particular sub-system of a larger system and see how it is acting in a linear way. It is after all where we get the adjective "systematic" from.<br><br>Working in a systematic way through your lesson plans is the same as working in a linear way through them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 August 2009 at 13:05 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hmm....interesting points. I've never thought about the breakdown of systemic thinking as linear. According to Wikipedia, systems thinking is based on the component parts being best understand in relationship to each other rather than in isolation. And then, understanding the part in relation to the whole. <br><br>It's hard for me to see relationships when working in a linear, or list fashion. So I think I would have to disagree that working through the lesson plans in a systemic way is the same as working in a linear way. At least with this definition in mind. <br><br>Yesterday I opened the XMind program and started a mind map for all the topics on the syllabus. Now I'm working on a mindmap for each topic. The resistance is gone and I'm filling in all of the resources I know about for each topic into its respective mindmap. Already I've discovered relationships between the topics and moved topics to more appropriate places. <br><br>Thanks for your comments, Mr. Forster.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 August 2009 at 14:41 | Bev P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bev:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Now I'm working on a mindmap for each topic. &gt;&gt;<br><br>In other words doing Step 1 for each of the 14 topics.<br><br>What will Step 2 be?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 August 2009 at 15:00 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mr. Forster,<br><br>Ahh....very good. Step two will be going through the resource material noted in each mindmap/topic and making a summary of points to include in lecture. Step 3 will be finding supplemental material to enhance the lessons, e.g., documentary, audio, guest speakers, etc. Step 4 will be organizing points for each topic, in order of relevance, according to how I want to present the material in class. Aside from the work related to required assignments, I believe that's it for the lesson plans. <br><br>So, it appears that the technique of mindmapping got me out of the stuck place. However, your overall point is that each part of a project is a step, no matter what the method used, correct? Can you now make a connection to all of this to the process of Auto Focus? <br><br>This has been a stimulating and informative discussion. I have to thank my colleague Avrum, for recommending I post this problem on this forum. This is a first for me.<br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 August 2009 at 15:38 | Bev P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bev:<br><br>&lt;&lt; However, your overall point is that each part of a project is a step, no matter what the method used, correct? &gt;&gt;<br><br>My overall point was that it's quicker to do each step for all projects together, than to complete one project then start on the next and so on.<br><br>In this particular example, you can:<br><br> EITHER <br>mindmap, then summarise, then find supplemental material, then organise points for Topic One. Then repeat the process for Topic Two and so on.<br><br>OR <br>mindmap all topics, then summarise all topics, then find supplemental material for all topics, then organise points for all topics.<br><br>The second method is generally faster more efficient and generates less resistance.<br><br>In Autofocus I would simply put in a task "Mindmap Topics" and keep re-entering it until it was completed. Then I would start a new task "Summarise Topics" and so on.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>27 August 2009 at 13:55 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mr. Forster: <br><br>Thank you for continuing to clarify your suggestions. I have started AutoFocus per a colleague's recommendation, however, the book filled with lists just sits by the side of my desk. I find it hard to keep up with a system of any kind. I mostly operate intuitively. I do seem to manage to continue to make things happen. I'm sure I would be a lot more productive if I used a system such as yours.<br><br>Thank you again for all of your comments.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 August 2009 at 18:14 | Bev P.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bev:<br><br>The real question is whether you are reasonably satisfied with the way you are operating now. If you are then there is no point changing things. <br><br>If on the other hand you are not satisfied, then it is worthwhile learning a new way of doing things. In that case I would suggest the following:<br><br>1) Don't have the book sitting by the side of your desk - you should keep it open on your desk.<br><br>2) Don't allow yourself to do *anything* workwise other than what the system shows you. Force yourself to use the system for everything. You'll soon get into the habit of it.<br><br>3) Don't fill the list with everything you can think of straight away. That's a pretty good way of sinking any system. Start by putting the things of immediate concern on the list, and then add further tasks as you think of them or as they come up.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>30 August 2009 at 18:29 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>"2) Don't allow yourself to do *anything* workwise other than what the system shows you.

However it is a quick regression from doing Autofocus to the adolescent "I WANT TO DO WHATEVER THE HELL IT IS I WANT TO DO".

I don't know how, at this point, how to make a segue from a huge project of preparing to teach a class next week, to the AutoFocus system.
