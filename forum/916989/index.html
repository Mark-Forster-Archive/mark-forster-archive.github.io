IOW, as it stands, one can't easily switch between AF2 and AF4 as one is paged based and the other not.<br><br>Perhaps changing the cycling rule might do it.

But an alternative perspective may be worth it if there are others like me, who haven't been able to get in the flow with AF4.  I'd vote for keeping all versions of AF as options, as individuals' personal styles and work situations do vary. I've finally realised that AF4 doesn't fit with my circumstances or with my inclinations, not sure which, and it was with some relief that I've switched back to AF3 last week.  <br><br>AF4 makes perfect sense to me in theory, and I expected to follow it.  But after several weeks of trying, I've realised that AF4 seems to require more discipline and a more methodical approach to working through the list than I'm able to sustain.  <br><br>Typically my time available is in short bursts between meetings or other commitments, so I need to keep scanning the list to know I'm picking out the most important thing to be doing at that time.  I need to be able to note down quick reminders about urgent things to do when I get back to my desk as well as the bigger tasks with future deadlines.  So when trying to do AF4, after scanning and picking out the must do now items, (or the items on the separate list of things I actually need to do next), I lose track of where I was 'supposed' to be up to in the main list or even which list (closed or open) I was in; this is because I can't tell when I am just scanning quickly to pick out any 'must do now' urgent items, or making a proper pass through the list where I need to follow 'the rules' for moving to the other list (or not), or for reviewing/ dismissing. There seems to be an overhead to working the list which doesn't flow for me.<br><br>With AF3 (or AF2), none of this is a problem - it allows you to keep on top of current items, look out for things further back which are becoming urgent, and forces you to deal with the oldest items gradually day by day.  It suits fragmented work sessions, keeps you responsive to what's going on now without having to work 'off list',  and it doesn't disrupt the dynamic of the list if you don't strictly follow the process but dart about to make the most of opportunities which present themselves to get things done.  It just seems lots more flexible and simpler to me.  Just my view of course.<br><br>By the way, thanks to Mark and everyone on this forum for your thoughts and ideas about getting everything done.

I'm reading through your explanation of your work patterns and it makes sense.  AF2/3 have a bias towards urgency, and if you have a lot of urgency it will help you get there.  <br><br>AF4 however has a bias towards *preventing* urgency.  If you can get to a point where very little requires immediate action, AF4 will keep you there by first rubbing out your backlog before these tasks become late, and second giving you a chance to work repeatedly on tasks that have become important just now, by re-inserting at the end of the list, so you can move a few things along quickly.<br><br>If your job is about new things constantly coming up (e.g. respond to customer calls), then I suppose AF2 might be the way for you.<br><br>As for losing track, may I suggest a paperclip attached to the current task?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 October 2009 at 22:54 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>&lt;&lt;I can't see any problem with switching to AF2 from AF4 for a short period - though I would keep the dismissal rules for AF4.&gt;&gt;<br>Mark: Of late, my life has become fast paced, and I am thinking of a switch to AF2 to tackle the many tasks that get thrown at the end of the list.

I start at the end of the list and work my way through. I eventually complete the backlog list (though I imagine it would take longer than AF4 since AF2 does not force you to tackle the backlog list).<br><br>Do I then draw a line under the active list to make it the new backlog as per AF4?

AF2 and AF3 were much better at this, but had their own issues.  With AF4 being accepted by so many people as the final version, but that being unworkable for me, I decided to try to start making my own rules, based on the the brilliant observations of AF, but something that worked better for me.<br><br>After a month of tinkering I think I have a system that incorporates all that I love about AutoFocus, but that really works for me.

Dismissal is one of the most important invention or Mark to my eyes. I feel discouraged with ever growing lists, and I experienced that being forced to take decisions on old tasks made me much more productive than ever. So whatever the tweaks are, I think dismissal is one of the most important rules to have, and I don't think there is much emphasis on this in your blog post. <br>Can you precise how you deal with dismissal ?<br><br>Alex</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2009 at 11:21 | Alexborne</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>A few points about the above discussion:<br><br>1) I don't think that jumping between AF4 and AF2 is a good thing. I envisaged that it might be a acceptable if one had a sudden unexpected period of urgent tasks... but I saw that as an exceptional case. If you work is always predominantly urgent then you would be better off sticking with AF2. If you have specific times when you need to work urgently (like clearing your desk before going on holiday) then best to use AF2 with a special "Must Do Before Going on Holiday" list.<br><br>2) AF4 is perfectly capable of dealing with a normal degree of urgent items. As you will have seen from my demonstration, the aim is to keep moving quickly through the list. You should avoid getting stuck endlessly in the closed list. Also avoid dumping huge quantities of stuff into your list. It should reflect those things which you are actively working on - not everything that you think you might get round to "sometime".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2009 at 12:40 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>One further thing:<br><br>You should not put anything on your list which does not reflect your current commitments and goals.

I have chosen to identify these when I'm working through the backlog and run through a page without selecting any items.  This allows an item to be on there a reasonable number of times with a chance of being selected.  When I hit the end of the page I evaluate whether or not these tasks are still relevant or are going to get any attention in the near future.  Sometimes I'll dismiss a task more spontaneously, if I simply realize that its no longer relevant or was handled another way, etc.<br><br>Mark,<br><br>I appreciate the idea of only keeping tasks on your list that you are "actively" working on.  It's obvious from your examples that this is how you work and this allows you to actively move all the tasks forward quite rapidly.  I envy that.<br><br>The challenge I see with this is that means that there must be yet some other, as yet to be defined system, for keeping track of all those things that I'm not actively working on right now, but may soon.  This requires either an initial sorting or moving them onto such a list by dismissal, and then evaluating dismissed items regularly to decide if its time to move them onto an active list.  I find this moving back and forth to be a bit tedious.<br><br>I realize its your system and that AF4 works for you.  I may completely mis-understand how this really works, but as I've attempted it, AF4 either results in tons of dismissal and re-evaluation of tasks or the inability to easily get to urgent items.  I can easily see AF4 working if I lived in a slower paced world then I do, but given everything on my plate, my lists have to get long because I have many open committments, not all of which are going to get "actively" worked on on a daily or weekly basis.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2009 at 16:40 | Power Secrets</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I do think the initial AF4 instructions are slightly incomplete, and Mark's explanations in-forum help to complete them.  There is also a need to handle things beyond the immediate commitment, and AF4 doesn't address that.<br><br>I keep Maybe Later lists of possible future commitments from which I may borrow new tasks to put into AF4.  I process tasks following AF4 principles:<br>1. Everything goes to my active list.  <br>2. Later as I pass by a task I may evaluate it.  If it represents something I'm not committed to doing soon, I either delete it or move it to one of these Maybe Later lists.<br>3.

Moving a task literally takes 2 seconds, and reviewing tasks takes a couple minutes every other day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2009 at 17:09 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Several people had expressed sentiments like Alex:<br>&lt;&lt;I must admit I was also feeling too much stuck into the closed list&gt;&gt;<br><br>Honestly, I think this simply means you misunderstood the rules.  The rules tell you to work on something if you feel like it.  If you're feeling stuck in the closed list, that means you feel there's something more important on the other side and you go there: Pass over any task you feel is less important than what's ahead.<br><br>Then if you come back to the closed list and find none of these things are important now, dismiss them!  And guess what: You will now be "stuck" processing the tasks you previously complained you couldn't get to.  And for those old tasks you really don't want to throw out: You re-enter them in your new open list, and they will sit there waiting for you to come back.<br><br>It all works very smoothly provided you keep your lists to a reasonable size.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2009 at 17:11 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Power Secrets,<br><br>I read your blog post.  I think it is great in that you have devised something that works for you.  I also like your idea of a notes page facing a list.  Personally, I don't think I could keep it up as it is fairly complex and involves some re-writing which I try to minimize.  I also just use a calendar as a tickler along with a filing system.  Overall, I think the best part of this group is that there is a constant thought to improve on time management systems and customize them to suit the individual as opposed to worship the systems other have created.<br><br>Gerry<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2009 at 18:25 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark wrote "You should not put anything on your list which does not reflect your current commitments and goals." And I understand the point about not letting the list grow too large. But I think one of the freeing things about AF is that you can "throw anything at it" as they say. This is similar to David Allen's exhortation to "empty your head" by writing anything down on a piece of paper and throwing it into your In tray. I usually keep my AF4 notebook (now a Field Notes graph-paper pocket-sized one) and pen with me, and seldom hesitate to add anything I think about doing. But perhaps I should prepend "Think about ..." or "Consider ..." or just add a question mark after items that don't seem particularly important or urgent or enjoyable at the moment. That way, they will be dismissed or transferred out of the list with less fuss when I come to them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2009 at 20:29 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I like think about or consider, because you clearly get the task done whether you decide to do the item or not, which may not even need to be dismissed, since you got it done.  Then you add the item if you decided to do it.<br><br>Gerry</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 October 2009 at 20:46 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Gerry,<br><br>I'm curious what about my blog posting that leads you to say that it involves some re-writing.  From my experience it significantly reduces the amount of re-writing that I was doing with AF4.  It's one of the things I like most about it.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 October 2009 at 0:06 | PowerSecrets</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I thought you said it did here<br><br>" If not complete, I re-write it at the end of the list and continue moving backward through the list."<br><br><br>It may reduce the re-writing versus AF4.  I am trying to do away with re-writing.  In my system I do not re-write until a notebook or pad is finished.  A task is either done, dismissed to use AF language or being done.  If it is being done, I do not rewrite it, it stays where it is in the system until is done or dismissed.  The goal is to eliminate complete pages when all of the tasks are done.   I only re-write once at the end of a notebook or pad which ever I am using.<br><br>Gerry<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 October 2009 at 15:59 | Gerry</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Gerry,<br><br>Ah, I see what you are doing.  This would definitely avoid re-writing.  This is different than the instructions I've seen normally presented here for using previous AutoFocus methods although the AF4 preliminary instructions are vague on this point.  I was intending to make a comparison between what I was doing an AF4, although on this specific point I think my technique is the same as what I understand AutoFocus/Mark to recommend.<br><br>I personally like some re-writing because it keeps things that I'm actively working on on my Active list and things that aren't end up being part of the Backlog.  This is how I end up with a single list that encapsulates the things I'm actively working as well as things ready to start in the near future (anytime I feel moved to do so), but separated by the Active/Backlog line.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 October 2009 at 16:46 | PowerSecrets</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Gerry<br>I agree.  It's far simpler for me to see if something is completed or not.  I do add to this when I timebox a limit to a task/project.  Example:  If I timeboxed a task for 4 hours, then I place a dot to equal 15 minutes.  Eight dots and I stop.  I certainly don't do this with everything but I do get benefits with my timeboxing techniques.  Also if I'm reluctant to start, I frame it as "I only need to complete one dot for now....."  lol!  Sometimes it launches a flow and sometimes not.  Oh well, each dot is another chance to launch myself again.  <br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 October 2009 at 17:47 | learning as I go</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>oops....<br>and the other eight dots after lunch if it's a hard fight.... <br>learning as I go</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 October 2009 at 17:50 | learning as I go</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
