Since my WinMobile Excel also reads/writes XLS files, and my desktop OOo Calc also reads/writes XLS. I think I'll consider that option, if I get too tired of some of the cut&amp;paste process I do in Google Docs to maintain my AF4 list. Just checked that rumoured Google Docs spreadsheet macros have yet to surface.<br><br>That Dropbox synch would also be good if I want to implement my AF4 list in Blade Wiki that runs on both WinMobile and WinXP. I used to do my GTD in Blade Wiki. But AF4 list is much simpler than GTD.<br><br>I just checked my WinMo 6.1 Outlook task. No "created date", but have "start date" and "due date". Could use start date for sorting. I can do cloud synch to my Lotus Notes server for the Mobile Outlook task. May be doable, but for some reason I'm not too keen on this. ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 October 2009 at 4:57 | sabre23t</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I now have "Explore AF4 on OutlookTasks/NotesTodo/WebTodo" task on my AF4 Google Docs spreadsheet list. <br><br>I know using MobileOutlookTask is much easier than using Google Docs via Mobile Iris browser.

Autofocus.cc still only supports AF1, though. <br><br>I also wrote a small portable application, AutofocusAHK. Its last stable release supports AF3, if you download the source from Github and compile it yourself you can choose between AF1, AF2 and AF3. I'm currently adding AF4 and will release a new binary once it's ready. <br><br>Together with csvAF4, there are currently two portable AF apps written in Autohotkey. Perhaps you can take a look at it and see if you can do what you want with it. Or collaborate with AutofocusAHK. Another interesting language might be Python. You can create portable executables of python programs using py2exe, and python can also run on Linux and Mac Os, which is not the case for Autohotkey.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>16 November 2009 at 23:17 | Andreas</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Andreas,<br><br>I managed to login from my job's computer, since the browser stored the password.

I know that both communities hate each other with a passion, find their respective language far superior and that there were some ugly disputes in the past concerning licenses. I just happened to get started with AutoHotKey and stuck with it. If you like the AutoIt syntax better, then go for it. All technical and ideological differences aside, I think they are very similar in what you can do with them. And they both share the same weakness of being Windows only.<br><br>Concerning GUI frameworks, I would probably make a decision between QT and GTK. Both are supported by many languages and operating systems, so learning them will benefit you even if you don't stick with python.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 November 2009 at 13:19 | Andreas Hofmann</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
