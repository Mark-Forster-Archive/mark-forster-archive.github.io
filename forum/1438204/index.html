Like all great ideas, it had been said before. How many times have we heard that the most important thing is to just get started? But Mark's presentation of this idea was most frabjous. <br><br>Pre-Mark, I would put things on my list and they would sit there (literally) for years. Mark's systems were always good for getting me to clean out those stale items.<br><br>But, as Mark acknowledges, Mark's systems were not always the greatest for getting things completed. Many times I have opened the folder, read a little bit, closed the folder, and re-entered the item. That's the downside of little and often.<br><br>Along comes SF and it is supposed to be based on little and often, yet encourage completion. I just can't fit both those ideas in my head in the same place at the same time. <br><br>If I know that I MUST complete my column 2 items or look at them again in, possibly, a few minutes, I am going to have a very hard time convincing myself that I'll just start on this little task. I will straight away have higher levels of resistance.<br><br>What I liked about little and often, the way Mark presents it, is that it is such an effective psychological trick. The fact is that sometimes, true, I do open the file folder and then put it away again. But, more times than not, once I start something I have overcome the most power obstacle--inertia--and I have necessarily created momentum sufficient to generate some serious progress. If the item is in column 2 and the rules are that I must complete it, I can't tell myself, "I don't have to complete this, I'll just take a little peek at it."<br><br><br>So, I haven't tried SF because I do not want to break with my conception of little and often by populating my list with tasks requiring completion.<br><br>I recognize that talking about a system is not nearly as effective as using a system. But the reality is that I won't use a system unless I think that the benefit of making the switch is worth the trouble. Please convince me that I have made a conceptual or practical error.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2011 at 19:42 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I absolutely know what you're talking about. For me the key is to make the tasks that go on the list really REALLY tiny. Gone are the days of putting in "write dissertation". (ok, I never actually did that, but you get the idea.)  Instead I put in very discrete tasks - currently I have two "in progress"  tasks in C2: the first draft of an exam that I'm giving next week and the background on a small embroidery project. I could actually break the exam down even more if I found myself resisting it - either by chapter or by section of the exam. Since making tasks extra-tiny has been my method of overcoming resistance anyway, this hasn't been a big hurdle for me. <br><br>Going with your "open the folder" example, you could open the folder and then choose a discrete task, which would then go in C1, not in C2, giving you some more distance from the activity.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2011 at 22:03 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Maybe i'm technically cheating, but I don't do it that way. C2 is an opportunity to continue working, and I make a decision on each item whether it should be continued or not. Done this way, your objection doesn't apply.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2011 at 22:22 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Moises, I was excited when Mark wrote "Read War &amp; Peace" in C2 and just left it there until done. The thought of writing down something big and not (necessarily) needing to dive into "project planning" sounded wonderful. I.e., his system did not force him to over-manage the project.<br><br>So when SF was released, I jumped into C2 with two large projects. One of them is drudgery (tax return), so it will create some resistance no matter where I put it, but it also does really need to be in C2 to keep me dejectedly working on it. The other is appealing and creative and was important to me at the time, but I have lately been resisting it. Upon reflection, I am finding that my priorities have truly changed on this one, and I am wanting to back up a step and consider finishing some other related projects first. Having two resistive projects in C2 has done exactly what you feared, Moises, bogging down my list a bit. The good news is that SF makes me acutely aware of what is not working and (as I crawled through the last two pages) very motivated to fix it.<br><br>So, I think I would not be "cheating" to move this 2nd project out of C2 (to C1; I don't want to stop entirely) and make room for something that really deserves to be there. Then I will be alternating the taxes with a creative treat as I move through the pages.<br><br>Alan, it sounds to me like you are reassessing C2 items intuitively on a regular basis, which tells me you have learned to use SF quite effectively. We just have to be honest with ourselves each time: am I bumping this project from C2 to avoid it, or because something truly changed? Or ... because I found a more effective way to tackle it?<br><br>As SF beginners, we are going to stumble on this sometimes, but it seems to me we will learn pretty quickly (a matter of months) how best to handle each sort of project. And "best" will be different for each of us.<br><br>The funny thing is, I am not finding this level of trial and error to be a problem. I think it's because SF has so few parameters that it feels manageable and invites exploration.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2011 at 23:07 | Bernie</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I thnk youve misunderstood the rules Moises. You dont have to complete things in column 2, you just have to work on them a bit and then re-enter them in the next pages column 2. Of course you have to eventually complete them but thats the whole point of working little and often isnt it?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 March 2011 at 23:17 | Meryl</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi moises,<br><br>First, just to make sure it's clear, I will reiterate what others have already said. You don't need to COMPLETE the items in C2. You just need to take some action on them before you can leave the page. If it's not completed, then you do move it forward to C2 on the next page.<br><br>So, you still do "little and often", but C2 keeps you doing that repeatedly on the same tasks until they are done.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt; If I know that I MUST complete my column 2 items or look at them again in, possibly, a few minutes, I am going to have a very hard time convincing myself that I'll just start on this little task. I will straight away have higher levels of resistance. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Looking at a C2 item "again in a few minutes" is normally pretty rare with SF. It depends how fast you turn the page.<br><br>If you have 7-10 pages and you go through them 1-3 times per day (which seems pretty typical) then that works out to about 20 to 90 minutes spent on each visit to a page. So, you'd be forced to deal with this task in C2 every 20 to 90 minutes, on average.<br><br>If you're a slow page-turner like me, you might be forced to deal with that C2 task 2-4 times per day.<br><br>Either way, even for the hardest tasks, I might do the "open the file" 1-minute trick once or twice, but then that's enough to break down the resistance so the next time I see the task I actually make some significant progress. And once you've got some momentum going on a project like that, I've found it can actually help me stay "in the zone". I take little breaks with each page turn, dealing with a few C1 items, but then returning to the main C2 task and just keeping working through it. After a day of that you can really make great progress on some pretty large tasks.<br><br>Smaller tasks (like the regular clearing out of the inbox) get done in 1-3 passes for me. First pass is often "I don't want to deal with this" and so I just open my inbox and close it again. Second pass is "OK let me spend 5 minutes here" and I prune a few things (and prime my subconscious for the third pass). Third pass is "Ok enough already just get it done".<br><br><br>I was also an avid DWM user, for almost a year, but I can honestly say DWM didn't do "little and often" or drive things to completion nearly as well as SF.<br><br>With DWM, items get pushed out to Today+7 repeatedly till they are done. For large items, every time I pushed it out to Today+7, I almost guaranteed that I'd have built up resistance to it again by the time I looked at that task again. Here is what often happened: The project is going to expire today unless I take action, so I open the file (and close it again). OK, that allows me to push it out to Today+7 again. I'll probably see the task again today, but I can just skip over it, no big deal. I don't REALLY have to deal with it for a whole week! So, several days or a week go by, and now I've really got to deal with it again (or face dismissal). So, I do the "open file" trick again. And several days go by. Finally I am going to miss a hard external deadline so I HAVE to get it done. So I just power through it and get it done. NOT in the zone. NOT very happy about it.<br><br>For small items, it's even worse. If I was resisting them in DWM, they'd just sit on the list for 30 days and then I'd be forced to deal with it or let it be dismissed. If I HAD to get it done, I'd do it -- but again, NOT in the zone, NOT very happy about it. If I tried the "open the file" trick, I could postpone little tasks indefinitely. I could avoid clearing out my email for weeks (cherry picking for so-called "urgent" or "important" emails).<br><br><br>So my conclusion is that SF actually does little-and-often far more effectively than DWM. I hope this helps convince you to give it a try.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>19 March 2011 at 2:07 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Thanks to everyone who took the time to advise me. <br><br>This is the first time that Mark introduced a new system and I did not test it immediately.

I think most people are more self-disciplined than I am though.<br><br>And most people do seem to like Superfocus so maybe you will too.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 March 2011 at 1:56 | Bliss149</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Bliss149,<br><br>Thanks for relating your experience with SF. Have you found any programs that worked better than SF?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 March 2011 at 2:03 | moises</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I was doing pretty well with plain old Autofocus, moises. I think it may have been the very first one but I'd have to look back at that.<br><br>At first, I still wanted to complicate it. But then I realized that what was working for me was that it was so simple and that it gave me so much freedom that I found myself actually WANTING to work on stuff that I had been procrastinating on forever.<br><br>The other thing I really liked was let's say I had an evening where my energy level was low and I didn't feel like doing anything very taxing. Before, I would try to whip myself into tackling that IMPORTANT, HIGH PRIORITY PROJECT.<br><br>Which of course I'd resist and the end result is that I'd do NOTHING and then end up feeling like a horrible lazy worthless slug.<br><br>But with the autofocus, I'd find something on the list that I DID feel like doing, do it, and mark it off my list. Then I'd feel so good about myself and getting things accomplished, it would just sort of snowball and next thing I knew I was working on the high priority project. Willingly! Even joyfully!<br><br>It was a revelation for me because I've tried my whole life to MAKE myself do things and when I stopped trying to force myself, I actually got MORE done.<br><br>But then all the COOL KIDS were doing SF. So I wanted to do it too. LOL<br><br>I do see the need for getting the most important things done AND for getting things finished. For me, I am thinking maybe autofocus plus a current initiative. I think having just ONE high priority project at a time might work best.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 March 2011 at 2:32 | Bliss149</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Try SF but with C2 being a voluntary thing. Take the attitude that C2 is for stuff you Want to start now or resume soon. This would take away the part about SF forcing you to do stuff.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 March 2011 at 3:50 | Alan Baljeu</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
