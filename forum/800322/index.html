It's a minor quibble, but I don't particularly like having to page past "dead" pages as I work through my list.<br><br>Has anyone else dealt with this?  What did you do?  Today I got annoyed enough with it that I simply moved the items on the pages before the dismissed ones forward on the list and called their original pages "closed".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>10 June 2009 at 21:24 | Sarah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>This happened to me too Sarah, I used a paperclip to clip them together.

It's a huge motivator for me to rephrase or dismiss the tasks before the closed pages. These are tasks I haven't worked on, and there is a underlying reasons for them, obviously. I may have built up resistance to them, or simply that a rephrasing will kick start the task at the end of the list.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 June 2009 at 7:36 | JD</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with JD,  it is a motivator to work on the older pages.

Having to page through them is an important cue as it helps me to see how relatively slow moving the earlier pages are. <br><br>I'm afraid I think you came to the worst solution. The AF process is intended to gradually increase the pressure on the slow-moving items until you either have to do them or dismiss them. Moving them up the list negates that.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>11 June 2009 at 15:00 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Heheh Mike, where are your GOALS?!?  <br><br>I also don't rip them out, because I usually have a phone number/address/web site on the page.

And yeah, you can't DO a goal, you do tasks. That's basic Goals 101. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>This may be one of those terminology confusions we have so often.  "Climb Mt.

I don't like to bother with the overhead of stuff like that, a daytimer, or a tickler file. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Gotcha.  I find that I take a few notes as the day goes along and that I want my AF list to stay "clean".  I'd never get through scanning it if I had to read all of my notes about various things.  They would be roadblocks, distracting me from doing things.  I'm distracted enough, thank you very much ;-)<br><br>My system is just managable as a "pocket system".  My wife is always razzing me about the junk in my pockets, but that is what wives are for!  ;-)  I've just opened a new book, and that has made things bulkier than I like.  But that has become an even stronger incentive to close pages so I can quit hauling the filled book around.  Fortunately, since I trash old pages, it is really very thin.  But the wire spiral still takes up space.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  If I start sleeping with my book, hopefully I'll know I'm so far gone that I'm beyond addicted.

And it's working fine so far:<br><br>- I can get around 26 'lines' of tasks on a card, which is low, but manageable. <br>- I can carry 'home' and 'work' stacks, so that I have the 'home' stack accessible from work, but it's not distracting when I'm cranking through the 'work' tasks<br>- I can keep dismissed cards in a batch somewhere safe and not drag them around with me all the time<br>- When a card is finally *done*, it gets binned, and my task load is quite literally lighter<br>- My stack is a physical reminder of how much is on my plate, and if I'm over-committed<br>- It's easy to spawn separate lists if need be, like a shopping list, or a sub-project list<br>- For more urgent tasks, I can if necessary tweak the order of the pages, so I make sure it comes up on the next page.<br>- Last but not least, my nice Moleskine notebook is being used for what I intended it for: notes and journalling, not endless task lists, which always seemed a bit of a waste. And the card stack tucks neatly into the pocket at the back (or slightly less neatly if I'm over-worked!)<br><br>Ok, so it's a bit wasteful using card instead of paper, but it has a nice feel, and is actually quite a lot cheaper than most notebooks, other than the cheapest options.
