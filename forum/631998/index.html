The advantage of this app is that it makes automatically a seperate list of all the things I have to do today and tomorrow ( my urgent-list). Moving tasks to different list is very easy. Also I can use tags if I want to see all my tasks related to af certain project for example. It works very well for me. <br><br>By the way: I love the AF system! <br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 16:14 | Canta</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm using Omnifocus on the iPhone for my Autofocus list, and it is working brilliantly!<br><br>Omnifocus was originally designed for GTD, so it incorporates a lot of functionality that really isn't needed with Mark's system. I just ignore the parts of the program I don't need, and try to keep things as simple as possible.<br><br>I have set up a single project called "Autofocus" where all my tasks are entered. By default, new tasks are added to the bottom of the list, just as Mark suggests in his instructions. <br><br>The most difficult part was duplicating the "page" concept which is at the heart of the Autofocus system. <br><br>At first I tried creating "divider tasks" - that is, tasks which had just dashes or asterisks to show where a new page began. However, I didn't like how it looked on the screen, do I ditched that idea pretty fast.<br><br>Fortunately, Omnifocus incorporates a feature called "task grouping" which lets you group several sub-tasks under a top level task. So now I just have top level tasks called "Page 1", Page 2", "Page 3" etc., with my actual tasks grouped underneath those top level items. I review them one by one, as Mark suggests.<br><br>For me, using Omnifocus for AF offers many advantages over paper. <br><br>• You can set start dates and due dates for tasks, so there is already a built-in tickler system within the program. This helps reduce clutter, because tasks/projects with a future start date are hidden from view until you need to begin working on them.<br><br>• Tasks due soon are highlighted in orange, those due today (or which are overdue) are highlighted in red. This provides reassurance that you will not overlook something urgent. <br><br>• Dismissed tasks can hidden by moving them to another list, thereby reducing clutter and making it easier to focus on what needs to be done. Pages where all tasks are completed/dismissed are also hidden from view.<br><br>• Routine items are easy to track because you can set up repeating tasks. Again, this helps reduce clutter because the tasks are hidden from view until they become due. It also eliminates the need for rewriting. <br><br>• Projects are easier to manage, because you can group subtasks/notes under a top level task.<br><br>I tried using Appigo's Todo, but I simply could not duplicate the "page" concept which is so necessary to make Autofocus work properly.<br><br>The only downside to Omnifocus is that it is relatively expensive for an iPhone app ($20.00), and even more so if you pair it up with the desktop app (a further $79). <br><br>I'll post some screenshots to Flickr soon so everyone can see how it works.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 17:10 | Trevor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Trevor<br><br>I'm not familiar with the application you mention which sounds to be a really useful one.  However a couple of of things you said, in that you can hide things that are not yet due, and projects etc, make me wonder if that would negate the benefits of AF.  Given that the mechanics of AF are the regular scaning of outstanding tasks, you might miss items that you could do earlier or projects where you could start to progress on the little and often approach.  My tax return is due 31 January - I could easily set up a due date of one week or so before - but if I didn't feel like doing it then I would be in my usual state of last minute panic. Now it has the chance to wander happliy past my line of vision, attracting my attention occasionally to a few small tasks, and I know that when it is completed all I will need to do will be to check that it has been received ok.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 18:07 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Christine,<br><br>(I have really enjoyed reading your posts, by the way. So much of what you have said about AF rings true for me as well.)<br><br>The great thing about Omnifocus (for me, at any rate) is that it allows you to set both start dates *and/or* due dates. So, to use your tax return example, I would set an early start date to ensure that the task comes into vision with plenty of time available for everything to be completed easily. <br><br>In theory, the task/project "File tax return" could sit on your list for the best part of a year; in reality, apart from filing receipts and other key documents as the need arises, there is very little that can be done practically until a few months before. As Mark says in his instructions, you need some kind of reminder system/tickler to prompt you to get started on something when it is appropriate. <br><br>All I'm doing, with Omnifocus, is maintaining a tickler system within AF itself, so the task/project automatically pops into view with plenty of time to spare. <br><br>Hope this clarifies my thinking and how I am using the program.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 19:25 | Trevor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have Appigo ToDo, but I couldn't figure out how to keep the Pages themselves front and center (as they would be embedded in the project list). TaDaList has only the lists (called Page 1, Page 2, etc.) and the items themselves. Since I already have my daily agenda (must-do items for today), I am looking through my AF lists for more must-do today items and am adding them to my LifeBalance agenda. Then I can look at it AND my AF lists to choose what to do.<br><br>I did find another app that I think would be very appropriate for AF: Zenbe Lists ($2.99 in the app store). As far as using start dates, I can see using a separate system to remind you of these things. I have my data in LifeBalance right now. So when I check LB and see that my relative's birthday is coming up, I will add "Send birthday card to &gt;&gt;" to my AF list. Trevor, are you moving these newly appearing items to your "Page" lists or are you keeping them separate? I am finding myself having to resist the temptation of using an AF system that uses too many of the tags, reminders, start dates, etc., because I think it will become my old system, which honestly wasn't working as well as this one to dissipate my procrastination. In other words, I already have a system (LifeBalance) that tells me what I'm supposed to be doing when. The problem was I wasn't doing much of it! <br><br>My current approach is working beautifully. It's just not complicated and exciting enough for me. It's like being on a diet. I'm losing weight, but I miss the rich, fatty foods. LOL I plan to stick with the diet though and will try to get my excitement from actually accomplishing. Back to my lists I go!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 19:57 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Trevor<br><br>Thank you for your comments.  That is an interesting concept; as I say I'm not familiar with the program but I like the concept of incorporating the tickler system into AF in an automatic way.  I presume from your explanation that those "now due" items just add theselves to the last page - I probably misunderstood your post as I thought they would be hidden on an existing page and so effectively reduce the number of lines on that page.<br><br>I think we will all come up with tips and tricks that will enhance our use of the system according to our personal work practices but I certainly feel that Mark's paper based approach best enables the system to flow for want of a better word.  I love technology and as soon as someone comes up with a PC that makes coffee (when AF guides it to of course!) it'll have pride of place on my desk, but somehow that old pen and pad just do it for me, for now at least  ........ :-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 January 2009 at 21:51 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I just wanted to put in a good word for Things, which has an iPhone app as well as a desktop version (and which now syncs beautifully – there were some hiccups during the beta phase). See my earlier postings (and Mel's) here:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/623232">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/623232</a><br><br>for details on the (simple) way I've implemented Autofocus in Things, and a suggestion from Mel about another way of doing it; and note that my second posting there points out a simpler way of accomplishing one particular end than I'd hit on when I started the thread. <br><br>I'm not claiming that Things is better for Autofocus than Omnifocus or any of the others, as I haven't tried any of those; just that Things is lovely in itself, and is easy to employ for the purposes of (uncorrupted) Autofocus. (Without very careful analysis, it looks to me like it has all the advantages of Omnifocus, too.) And I'll just add three other notes here: (i) The way I handle the "tickler" aspect of the system is to schedule tasks for the appropriate day. When the day arrives, the task is automatically moved into the Today list. I then begin each day by simply moving anything that's shown up on the Today list that morning onto my active page. (It sounds as though this is equivalent to start dates in Omnifocus. Things has due dates, too, but I don't use them.) (ii) In line with Mark's amendment about "same day urgent" items, I've started tagging such items "same day". It's then easy to drag them from one page to another until they're done, as I move through the pages. (iii) Things is cheaper than Omnifocus; it's $49.95 for the desktop version, and $9.99 for the iPhone app.<br><br>I'm not affiliated with the makers of Things, incidentally; just a fan.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2009 at 0:19 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Martin, by active page, do you mean your last page?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2009 at 1:09 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Whoops, sorry...yes, that's what I meant.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2009 at 4:41 | Martin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Martin, I think Things is a terrific app, and I did experiment with it for AF before plumping for Omnifocus. However, I wasn't happy with having scheduled/tickler items pop up in a different view and then having to move them to the correct page. I have a lot of routine/repeating items, some of which repeat several times a day, so having to check to see whether these have popped up and then move them to the appropriate page was a hassle. With Omnifocus, everything is kept on the same screen, with tickler items popping on to the last "page" automatically. It may seem like a small difference, but I wanted to keep my digital implementation of AF as maintenance free as possible. <br><br>The other advantage, for me, is that Omnifocus also supports subtasks - so an item like "Prepare tax return" contains all the next steps needed to complete the project. Once I've completed as much as I feel like doing or is possible for today, I simply move the entire project forward to my last AF "page", perhaps setting a new start date of "tomorrow" so that the project can be hidden from view until then. Of course, individual items can be plucked from within the project and listed as separate items on AF pages should it seem necessary.<br><br><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2009 at 18:11 | Trevor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Trevor, <br><br>I have been using Omnifocus for about a year (laptop version), and while I have shifted exclusively to Autofocus at home, I am looking for a way to combine the two at work, expecially because of the volume of "urgent" tasks my superiors delegate to me where they expect "immediate" action.  So I wanted to ask, if you keep your AF list within Omnifocus, where the "pages" come from?  Or do you keep the AF list separate somehow?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2009 at 20:12 | Rick</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Rick,<br><br>If you read my first post in this thread carefully, I think you'll see how I am managing to create "pages" within Omnifocus. Of course, these are not actual pages, just top level tasks called Page 1, Page 2, Page 3 etc. with my AF tasks underneath. If you have the desktop program, it should be easy to see what I mean.  <br><br>I work exclusively from within this single view, and just work with these virtual pages in the same way as Mark describes in his instructions.<br><br>Most of the time I am using Omnifocus on my iPhone, where this approach works well.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2009 at 21:37 | Trevor</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I have discovered that most IPhone task/list apps can be set up to be used for AF. Remember the Milk, Toodledo, ToDo by Appigo. The benefit in using these more complex apps is that you can put due dates on those tasks that truly need them. Of course, the risk is that you will overdo it with the features that just muddy up the system. <br><br>I have been thinking about a way of integrating AF with LifeBalance since I have so much data already entered into it and I love the calendar part of the system. I also enjoy seeing how all my activities fit within the larger context of goals. I think I have a solution that would be applicable to other more complex task managers (again, with the warning that using this approach MAY reduce the effectiveness of AF; I plan to test it this week). <br><br>What I have done is created an Autofocus goal in LB with each Page as a subtask and all tasks as further subtasks for each page (LB works like an outliner if you're not familiar). When I am working on AF tasks, I will go directly to the outline rather than letting LB tell me what to do. One disadvantage to LB for AF is I can't see a count of how many items there are per page, though 4 screens of items is 32, the number of lines in my notebook I used originally. If I can deal with that, here is the benefit. When I COMPLETE an item, I will assign it to its real life goal and give it the true effort I put into it. that way my pie chart will be accurate, but I don't have to slow down the input of tasks by trying to determine this ahead of time. In fact, I think it's possible, that adding this information after the fact (something I actually enjoy doing) will be like an extra bonus reward for doing the task. I like to see if I'm spending too much time in one area or another--like spending lots of time trying to fix my AF system that isn't broken. LOL<br><br>Let me just say that I could really be fooling myself here and I may return to my trusty tadalist or to another app, but I'm giving it a try for now.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>18 January 2009 at 21:50 | Mel</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>If I can get permission from Mr. Forster, I could have an iPhone app out in beta for autofocus in a few weeks.

That is what I love about the digital vs. paper approach. It's motivating for me to see that number go down (and I don't have to keep count myself!).<br><br>Right now I am using ToodleDo, but I'm using ToDo by Appigo on the IPhone as my interface. I love that when I mark an item done, it gets crossed off in color (I'm very into color for some reason) and it drops to the bottom of that page (just as it does in tadalist). The things I really love so far about ToDo is any items I give a due date too are listed at the top of that page. I don't really pay attention much to it as I'm working through my pages, but I like that it's structured that way. Due dates (which I'm really only assigning for true must-do on said date tasks) also mean I can look at a Focus or Hot List while I'm working through my list if I'd like. I am tagging true errands as well as a safety net in case I do forget something I could be doing. <br><br>Finally, what I'm MOST excited about using this method is that I can look on Toodledo with a Pro account and see how many tasks I'm entering vs. how many I'm doing per day. I LOVE that! It is really motivating me to be able to see that if I do X number more tasks than I enter on a given day I should be able to clear my current task lists in X days. I also have the option of assigning completed tasks to goals (lifelong, long-term, short-term) after the fact and very quickly online. <br><br>I wish I weren't a fiddler, but I'm hoping this may be my list fiddle and I'll be playing beautiful music with my lists from here on out.
