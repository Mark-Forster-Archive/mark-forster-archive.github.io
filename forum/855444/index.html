I want to share some of my initial impressions with you ... with more to follow as I gain experience.<br><br>1) WOW!  The packaging is better than a lot of products bought elsewhere!  No kidding, very cool.<br><br>2) It is small and light... about the size of a large paperback but very thin and light.  I got the cover and a reading light with it for a total price of just under $350.<br><br>3) I wish the contrast were a little bit greater, but it is not bad.  It is not back lighted so you need a reading light for night.  The small one I got has two speeds ... LED lights which run on 3xAAA batteries.  Clips nicely on top of the Kindle.<br><br>4) Buying books is a snap.  You do get them in under a minute.  Jeff Bezos (father of Amazon and the Kindle) claims "under 60 seconds) but privately says it takes about 12 seconds if you have a good connection.  The books are a bit more expensive than the dead tree versions ... despite what Jeff claims.  He compares $9.99 for most best sellers to the hard backed versions.  But if you buy the paperback, they cost sometimes 1/2 that much.  But you do get the convenience.  You don't have to gas up the buggy (which costs way more than the book these days ;-), drive to the store, and buy more than you wanted ;-)  Click right from the Kiindle and you have it instantly.  If your time is worth anything this is the way to go.<br><br>5) Books are downloaded over Amazon's private Spring Network ... Amazon pays the tab for the network.  They are keeping it a bit quiet but you can actually use the Kindle over that 3G EVDO network to do other things.  If it becomes too widely advertised Amazon might start charging for it.  ;-(<br><br>6) You can copy some of your files to the Kindle by plugging it into your computer's USB port so it looks like a disk drive.  It will read Word, .TXT, and MOBI, as well as a couple of other things ... but not PDF.  The new, larger DX reads .PDF.  Of course, you can get free software to convert anything to anything these days so that is not a show stopper.<br><br>7) You can actually access the internet over the damn thing ... but it is slow and klunky.  You can send email using your Gmail account, access Wikipedia, Google Search, etc.<br><br>8) While reading you can get a dictionary lookup for any word you put the cursor on.  Way cool.<br><br>9) It has a rudimentary text-to-speech facility so it will read the book to you over its small stereo speakers or a plugged in headset.  It is not fantastic and the words sometimes run together and can be puzzling.  But I suppose you get used to it.  The idea is that you can "read" on the treadmill.<br><br>10) There are a gazillion free ebooks out there ... all of those in the public domain which amounts to all of the classical literature ever written.  JB's vision is to have every book ever published in digital format.  He may just do it.  Oh, and if your family has multiple Kindles, you can share the books ... up to six Kindles on a single account.  AND, it will, if you select the option, synchronize the books over their network so that when you close the book on one Kindle and open it on another, it remembers where you left off reading.<br><br>11) Jeff's vision for the kindle was to make it like a book.  When he asked himself what was the distinguishing feature of a "book" it was that it "disappeared".  IOW, once you started reading you forgot you were holding a book.  He has actually achieved that with the Kindle, IMO.  You only need to press one button (next page) with either thumb and that is like turning pages.  Nothing else to mess with while reading.<br><br>Bottom line ... I'm very impressed with this gizmo.  I was not going to get one for myself but I'm now reconsidering.  I might spring for the DX ($500) because of the PDF ability and higher resolution.  And I don't mind the almost double weight.  And, of course, my eyes are getting older and I can use the bigger screen.  I really think that this thing is going to revolutionize reading.  So what if Steve Jobs says it is a non-stater because no one reads anymore.  Harumph, for those of us who do, it is ground breaking,<br><br>After I catch up on some sleep (I've been fooling with the damn thing since we got it yesterday) I'm going to convert some of my PDFs into Kindle format and see how that goes.  Oh, and find out why my background music won't play on it (I think it is because I have it in a sub directory).  Did I mention that?  It plays music as well!  Oh yeah, and shows pictures.  And has a slideshow mode to turn the pages for you and .... on and on and on.<br><br>Please feel free to ask questions.  They will stimulate my investigation ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 August 2009 at 20:36 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Rather frustrating it's taking an age to get to the UK.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 August 2009 at 20:46 | Man of Kent</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike, they're not available outside the U.S. - don't rub it in!!!  :-(  :-(  :-(<br><br>I've heard that the Sony e-book reader is better... :-)<br><br>Here's another very good site - free chapters, excerpts - which has downloadable books (also to blackberry or iphone):<br>www.shortcovers.com<br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 August 2009 at 20:56 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike<br><br>I had a Sony Reader for about 18 months before getting the Kindle in June.  Much prefer tit so far.  The experience of buying books on the Kindle is just so much better than on the Sony.  They also tend to be cheaper on Amazon although Sony have just announced a reduction in their main price to $9.99.<br><br>From an AF perspective, it does a similar thing to what I think Mark was describing in a recent post, ie it reshuffles the main list so that the most recently read book is at the top.<br><br>Martin</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>5 August 2009 at 23:40 | Martin H</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>like the idea of the Kindle, will probably get one once it arrives in the UK. What I don't like is that the books you buy are more like licenses. I'd prefer to physically own the books I really like. (awhile ago Amazon deleted the book 1984 on all kindles that had it (which is ironic in itself, considering)).</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 0:26 | Peter Knight</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Man,<br><br>There is speculation that it is one of two reasons:<br><br>- Cell carrier resistance<br>- Copyright issues<br><br>It really is too bad.  I'm confident that the propagation is not for want of Jeff's trying.  He'd love to go world wide with the thing.<br><br>If you wanted one now, you'd have to buy it in the US, then copy books to it yourself as the network would be useless.  Hopefully soon, however.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 0:30 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Martin,<br><br>I heard the Sony was nicer but was lagging behind.  I think the Kindle will be a Sony killer simply because of the instant download feature.  We Americans are all about instant gratification ;-)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 0:32 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Peter,<br><br>Yeah, my irony meter broke on that one ;-)  I'd love to have been a fly on Jeff's wall when he called the VP in charge of Kindle operations on the carpet.  What a horrible embarassment.<br><br>Licenses:  Yes, that is a problem that is not easily overcome because of the piracy issues.  But you can protect your purchases by saving them to your local hard disk.  The kindle connects via USB port and looks like another disk drive.  Now what I don't have a handle on is how one would convert a Kindle format to something like PDF so that the file would be useful on the computer.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 0:35 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike - Does the Amazon Spring Network work in rural areas?  Is it enough if you have a WiFi network in your house?  <br><br>Thanks for the review!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 2:09 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Seraphim,<br><br>Please forgive the typeo -- it is the SprinT network.  Sheesh.  I'm tired ;-)<br><br>No. Wi-Fi won't help.  It is a cell network.  The kindle has a 3g EVDO radio in it which connects to the Sprint Cell Phone Network.  It is as if you are making a phone call.<br><br>Take a look at:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/02/a-map-for-the-k/">http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/02/a-map-for-the-k/</a><br><br>(And thanks for the prompting.)  I noticed that my Kindle said "1X" which is a lower speed connection.  I'm in the Washington D.C. area so coverage can vary by neighborhood.<br><br>That last link looks like a static picture.  Maybe this will work better.  Yeah, it does.  When I put in my zipcode and then zoom in it is clear that I am right on the ragged edge of "poor".  If I drove two blocks my speed should jump dramatically.<br><br>Now you COULD connect your laptop to your internet via Wi-Fi or whatever, and download the books to your computer and copy them across.  Not so cool but you'd still end up with them on your Kindle reader.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 2:41 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>The problem with getting it in Canada is that we don't have Sprint, and they can't negotiate a deal with the various cell phone companies in the country.

Yeah, the competition is getting stiff.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I'm curious to know how it is on your eyes for long stretches.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I can't speak to that yet.  I'll report back after a time.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Does Amazon have any public domain books for the kindle?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, they have a few things on Amazon.  But you can download the whole damn Project Gutenberg if you like ;-)  There are quite a few sites trading in free ebooks ... legitimately.  I'm noticing that authors are starting to get creative.  One author is giving away the first in her series of books and selling the Kindle editions of the others for $9.99.<br><br>I have begun experiminting with various sources to see what I can accomplish with it.  I just got my music working ... and stragely, it keeps playing when the Kindle goes to sleep.  I converted a .PDF to .AWZ (or whatever the peculiar name for Amazon's .MOBI format is ;-)  My experiment failed.  The book converted and loaded but will not read.  Back to the drawing board ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  And how much battery life you have while reading.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Battery life is cited as about a week if you don't keep the modem turned on.  Today I worked for about 6 hours with the modem on and intensive Internet access and I used 1/2 the battery.  I believe the week of normal reading.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; And how you keep the budget for books down - that would be so much temptation for me... &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes, you could go into the hole on books ;-)  But if you love the classics, as I do, well ... they are all free ;-)<br><br>I have just started an organized download of The Great Books of the Western World ... they are all in the public domain.  (I mean, is Aristotle going to want his cut of the royalties? ;-)  The downside to public domain is that some of it is a bit rough.  Who knows who did the data entry and how much error checking went on.  But you get what you pay for.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I'm curious to know too what will happen when the Apple i-Touch tablet comes on-line.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Probably not much.  Amazon already supports the iPhone and iTouch getting Kindle books.  I suspect that Amazon is more interested in selling books than machines.  It is one of those things since from forever:  Give away the camera and sell the film; give away the razor and sell the blades."  A time honored tradition.  ;-)  I'm not sure Amazon and Apple will go head to head on this one.  I'm not sure that Amazon cares.  If Apple users are buying Kindle books, why would they care?  In any case, why would Apple want to try to compete with Amazon who are breaking the ground with publishers and the distribution hassles.  Apple can continue to sell gobs and gobs of computers and phones and let Amazon sweat the publishing.  At least that is what I would do if I were Steve Jobs.  Do what you do best and let the other guy work for you.  Time will tell.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 4:09 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Here's a link that has some sites for free ebooks - not all for the Kindle:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://ireaderreview.com/2008/01/19/free-books-for-the-amazon-kindle/">http://ireaderreview.com/2008/01/19/free-books-for-the-amazon-kindle/</a><br><br></div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 August 2009 at 4:20 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>While on the topic of free books, there's also Librivox for those who like audiobooks.
