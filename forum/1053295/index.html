You can batter away at the problem in a labour intensive way (if there even is a problem perceived) through heavy moderation which is kind of silly and has been unnecessary for the most part - or create a structure that actually makes it easier to do the right thing - ie. go off topic and whatnot in the right place.  <br><br>Lots of techie people are on here that could probably assist with a transition to something else.  Norman can even set up the search tool.<br><br>Like everyone else, I think it's wonderful that Mark is retired and doing stuff he is drawn to do.  But isn't this a case sort of like the E-myth, where you have to step aside and think about working on your system rather than in the system?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>26 March 2010 at 13:55 | Jacqueline</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Jacqueline,<br><br>is there really any problem?

He's using his systems to take action on major life goals. <br><br>I noticed the same thing happening on davidco.com.

Then those who have the most valuable input, wander off as the place becomes unfriendly to them.  Like it or not, that is the way society works.  If you want value, you have to be willing to give value in return.  Norman likes to muse about this and that and pull everyone's leg.  If you try to stuff him into a box, he'll go somewhere else to play then you'll lose his input.<br><br>If you were to waste time building a matrix of the number of posts "of value" from people who were "problems" (as determined by list 'marms) vs the posts of value from those 'marms themselves, I think you'd see my point dramatically.<br><br>In any case, light the tourches, storm the castle, run from the hot lead, when it is all over and done with, this will be a friendly place where we come to meet friends and help each other ... or a very quiet place where people ask questions and get only silence in response.

I come here for time management advice - that's all really.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>That is your reason to be here.  Others have different reasons.  Those of us who have been here a while and "know all there is to know" ;-) are here mostly for community.  I have been here for over a year now so I've been through AF1-&gt;4 and DWM.  By now I kind of get what Mark is proposing.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  2. I find some of the obscure off topic discussions really off putting - they seem to appear on every thread now so it's hard to find the useful stuff from the banal.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>As much as you don't get why we like to talk amongst ourselves, I don't get why you find it so off putting.  So what if they appear on every thread.  Pass on by.  Elsewhere you say you have a hard time with the space bar because you have to read.  I just can't wrap my mind around that.  I read all kinds of nonsense and am none the worse for wear ... for wear ... for wear ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  3. I do belong to another forum - have been a member since 2005 - and it has never been nasty or bickering, just supportive and helpful - so it is possible. I also belong to other forums that I have been using for a shorter period of time and they are respectful of others also.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>As is this one.  The only disrespect I've seen lately comes from those who want Norman to go away because they don't like what he has to say.  It is not those who are chattering who are not respectful.  Is there much disrespectful about the posts by Mel, Jacqueline, Seraphim?  I don't think so.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  4. Most other forums I belong to respect others posts and don't go off topic - there is an off topic area reserved for this type of 'chat' &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Two things here:<br><br>1) Posting off topic is not disrespect ... it is simply posting information that is not on topic.  "Respect", in this case, is a characterization and yours differs from mine.<br><br>B) People don't simply answer a post with something totally out of left field.  The "conversation" (and that is exactly what it is, even if it looks like a series of disconnected posts) "drifts".  One idea least to another.  Moreover, in most cases the question has been answered directly, by serveral posters in several ways with several (often differing) points of view ... BEFORE it drifts off topic.  In fact, the drifting is often because the discussion becomes about the differences of points of view.  There is most often no RIGHT answer.  There is my answer and Mel's answer and the the wrong answer ... Norman's ;-) ;-)<br><br>3) As mentioned elsewhere, how do you know what the topic of your post is before you write it?  I don't.  I may start on place and wind up at another.<br><br>iv) Seriously, do you think that it even makes sense to read a post and then go someplace else to answer it just because your answer, while relevant, does not actually answer a question posed.  That would be highly distracting.  Every other post in that area would start with: "Joe asked ... and that got me thinking about the phases of the moon so ..."  Come on now ;-)  Does anyone do that IRL?  If you listen analytically to any conversation, it drifts all over the place.  Do you say: "Oh, wait, before we change he subject, are we finished with this one?"  You'd have few friends!  ;-)  Yeah, other places have "off topic" areas but that does not stop things going off topic in answer to posts on specific topics.  It is just human nature.<br><br>5) This is not a "forum" in structure.  It is just a list of topics which are not allowed to exceed 100 posts or so.  After that, Mark closes the topic.  So there can BE no "off topic" thread.  And if there were, people would complain that your off topic comment was off topic from the last off topic comment.  OY!<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  5. Why not just post topics that are off topic with a heading that starts OT - then everyone knows what they are and can read or ignore as they prefer?  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>What is "on topic" and what "off topic"?  To one person AF is now off topic because Mark has introduced DWM.  To another AF is on topic because the topic is Mark's Time Management systems.  To another Covey is on topic because the topic is really Time Management systems in general.  To others goals and values are on topic because in order to be effective in doing anything you need those, or so goes one school of thought.  We've had discussions on planning, intuition, and what kinds of book to write in or software program to use.  What the HELL is really ON topic?  ;-)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  6. I believe that in any forum we have to respect each other and each others views. There is nothing wrong with having a bit of fun or a bit of a ramble into other areas, but how about doing it on specific OT threads and please everyone? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Amen to the idea of respect.  But I hope I have demonstrated the futility of even deciding what is relevant to whom.  If Mark had more of a dictatorial bent, he would lay down a law.  That is just not Mark, however so we have a lot of latitude ... and it has worked for the year and a quarter or so I've been here ... and other have been here longer and seem to be thriving.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2010 at 11:54 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mike:<br><br>"iv)"<br><br>You are learning.<br><br>I had an FF extension count the number of instances of my name in your tome.

How does being willing to scan through verbosity imply a mastery of time management skills?  I can't make that connection.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  It may be that there are a number of readers who have been here for ages and know mostly what they want to know about the various systems on offer - but what about new people? It's very disconcerting to post a question then have to soft through a load of totally unrealted text to find the solution to something that may be of importance to that person.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>But is that not always the case?  First of all, the person who asked the question does not know what is related ... if he did, he most likely would not have had the question in the first place.  Secondly, if he DOES know what is related, he is probably wrong and will find out when he reads ideas he might never have thought of.  Finally, maybe he will learn something interesting about the phases of the moon that he never knew and even though it was not what he was looking for, be greatly amused.  So why do you feel that you should arbitrate, or even COULD arbitrate this kind of thing?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I respect the fact that you have been here for a while Norman, and that you probably have learnt all you want to regarding time management, but not everyone is in this enviable position.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>And that is why there are here to drink from the depths of the fountain of Norman's wisdom.  ;-)  Seriously, though, people come here for advice AND GET IT.  Your complaint might have merit if all we did was point fingers, giggle, and dance around at every question.  But we ANSWER, with vigor, and humor, and good will ... and if the answer is not understood, we answer AGAIN, and AGAIN ... and at no cost at all, except to ask for a little tolerance and understanding in return.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I also worry that Mark may just decide to pull the plug on the whole forum with all this bickering. I very much doubt that he needs all this hassle. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Why would he?  And what hassle is Mark experiencing?  He does not have to scold the children very often.  The most of his work comes from cleaning out the SPAM.  I don't know, but I get the sense that Mark can scan through text very quickly ... he's a writer, after all.  I know posts here are not exactly advanced calculus!  ;-)<br><br>Honestly, I believe that what you see is a mature forum, with multiple ideas each with its own adherents and so there will be different answers to many questions then ensuing discussion about why the answers differ.  Basically, Mark has produced five successful time management systems and opened up the floor to discussion ... that's the price of success.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 March 2010 at 12:16 | Mike</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman Norman Norman Norman Norman Norman Norman Norman Norman Norman Norman <br><br>'zat better?

That may be useful for newbies anyway. Do those of you who dislike the OT posts and humor have any idea how many deserted forums there are? We could run an experiment and see what would happen to this one if all the regulars quit posting for a while. I certainly know my prediction! I had quit visiting the forum regularly until the interpersonal stuff got interesting. I enjoy answering questions, but how many of them are there? And by the time I get here, they've typically been answered by several posters. Sure, I'm interested in on-topic stuff, too, but there's so very little to be had here these days. That's why I asked before for people to post topically and if they can't, I don't think there should be complaints about OT posts. If you can't find the information you're looking for amidst a post with many replies, repost it! There are several here who will gleefully give you the info as often as you need it.<br><br>I've belonged to groups that rigidly enforced OT rules and those that did not. I never belonged to the OT-enforced ones for long. I can Google for answers.

One way to do it is to not create a separate forum, but a mechanism when posting that allows you to select whether the post is OT or not.  Then when you view the board, you have a choice of viewing all threats or only OT threads.  I would guess though that in order for that to be worth it in terms of time for Mark or a board mod, we'd need a lot more traffic through here.  <br><br>Norman U makes a good point about this probably not being a problem, but I disagree with the primary purpose behind the forum that Mel describes. Likely part of the reason that Mark did not just toss up a FAQ was to stem the tide of questions that come his way-that's where the forum comes in.  I don't think that requires a community at all and certainly not some of the OT stuff that goes on here, but just a group of people that are familiar with Mark's writings.  <br><br>Ultimately people will vote with their feet or mousepads.  Obviously Mark is trying to drive business by setting up this site and once the site stops doing that this forum is doomed to hit the rubbish bin.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>29 March 2010 at 6:40 | TK</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>We have tried various wikis in the past, and ChristineB did a very helpful AF1 FAQ linking in posts on a number of recurring themes.

ONT).   When there is an off-topic sentence, you simply insert the corresponding abbreviation (OFT for "Off-Topic Sentence")  at the end (ONT).  Sometimes I wonder if Norman and Mark aren't the same person (OFT).  When navigating through a topic, you can use the "Search / Replace" function to guide you from one "ONT-sentence" to the end of the next "Ont-Sentence."  (ONT)  Then simply backspace to the beginning of that sentence and read it -- with full confidence that you are "on-topic."  (ONT)    I've never seen Norman and Mark in the same room together (OFT) .

You didn't get to know Proust in one sentence either. You take each one as they come. Same here or in face to face discourse. Why not adopt a stance of charitable curiosity (a redundancy in their root meanings). Of course a hermeneutics of charity does not mean simply letting a text go on and on without criticizing it or ignoring its difficult and frustrating parts and challenging them. As Augustine pointed out so long ago, it is exactly those tough spots which require most of our attention and charity. We have to willing to keep re-reading in light of that next sentence. We really have no other choice. How we attempt to read, we do have some choice in. What goes for texts goes for relationships.

Certainly hermeneutics had been used prior (but not really developed explicitly), but with Augustine begins the explicit discussion of how one approaches a text, again specifically the Christian Scriptures.<br><br>Augustine believed (in short) that in order to understand a text (again the Christian scriptures) two primary precepts, stands, modes of being, etc. had to be understood or taken up:<br><br>Love of God.<br>Love of one's fellow man.<br><br>Implied in his writing is also love of the writings themselves. In light or within the horizon of such love, only then can only fully engage in interpretation of Scripture, especially the difficult parts, which many would like to pass over or quickly explain away. (Jesus calling people dogs.) For Augustine, these "dark passages" is where understanding and relation with the text, God, and one's fellow man truly begins.<br><br>Hermeneutics over time became more and more explicitly developed especially in the 18th and 19th centuries expanding the method to texts outside the Christian Scriptures. Hermeneutics as such began to be looked at and attempted to be understood in a hermeneutic manner.<br><br>In the 20th century, a radical shift was made in hermeneutics. Heidegger applied this understanding to understanding of everyday life. To "man" how related to the world.<br><br>This insight would shake philosophy and all the social science, especially on the Continent and in the Anglo-American world (except in Philosophy.)<br><br>A so-called hermeneutics of suspicion has been described beginning in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It often suggested as a departure of a hermeneutics of charity. In other words, rather than love being the fundamental relationship of one to a text or another person or the world, the understanding of that relationship should be first put under suspicion.<br><br>The great triad of hermeneuts (practioners of hermeneutics as such) of suspicion are commonly held to be: Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx.<br><br>This is an extreme misunderstanding, for these men first and foremost loved those texts they looked at and those people they attempted to understand and the world around them. It might be hard to see at first, but within a hermeneutics of charity it is clear these men were lovers of what they wished to understand.<br><br>In fact, I doubt that any struggle to understand anything cannot be marked primarily by love, even if that love is not made explicit.<br><br>The basic tenet of hermeneutics (we are talking in the most simple of terms) is that when you approach a text, a person, or the world, you already have an understanding of it. That understanding might something like: "this is a book" or just "this is something." Nevertheless within that understanding you already bringing a lot to the table and as you read or relate further to that which you are trying to understand, that further understanding informs your prior understanding, And that new insight to your first encounter informs the next. Thus the hermeneutic circle.<br><br>This is most easily seen in texts. You read the first sentence of Proust. You have some idea what to expect before even beginning to read him. Each sentence informs your initial understanding and every prior sentence which then serves to inform your understanding of the current sentence and the next.<br><br>Thus understanding has a circular or spiraling nature. It is not one of a tabula rasa where you just learn new stuff. Or a tinker toy analogy where you just are adding knowledge piece by piece in some network of understanding governed by rules which can be made explicit (cognitive science).<br><br>This might all seem basic, but there is plenty of nuance to it. Especially when it comes to understanding everyday life.<br><br>Something like the word "prejudice" becomes a vice in our era, but without a pre-judgement no matter how clear that pre-judgement is to us, is necessary to understand anything. So pre-judgement is not a "bad" thing or barrier to understanding, but rather the very condition of understanding. As we engage what our pre-judgement has allowed us to understand in some manner, hermeneutics can then help us understand those latent pre-judgements and how they help or hinder of our understanding. But alway keeping in mind that these pre-judgements can never be made fully explicit, for no knowledge can ever be made completely explicit.<br><br>This is not bad news, but the good. For a good interpreter is always ready to be surprised, to be wrong, because he necessarily is wrong in the sense he can never understand something completely. The fullness of understanding can never be had. This allows a certain distance between the interpreter and the interpreted. With the right balance, with love, a reciprocal relationship can develop and respect be developed.<br><br>For if we are primarily understanding beings, what are we without that which we attempt to understand? To fully understand something, would be self-destruction and destruction of the understood, whether a text or another person or the world. To engage in the hubris of believing on can fully understand or a rejection of our own relation to world as understanding entities is too impoverish ourselves and the world around us.<br><br>In short.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 April 2010 at 11:53 | Norman U.</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Norman U:<br><br>&lt;&lt; The emotional markup language. &gt;&gt;<br><br>We didn't call it that then.
