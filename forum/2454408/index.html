Also, if you're going to offer advice such as: "Lay out your clothes the night before", it's probably best to let people decide if it's worth their time.

Most time management books / systems are short on the research side.  They might craft a nice system that seems to have all the right features, and provide some insights and useful techniques - but really lacking on data to back up the principles espoused, which might account for their limited audiences / staying power.   GTD, 7 Habits, 12 Weeks, Michael Linenberger, all come to mind.<br><br>Your books don't always cite the research in great detail -- or at least I haven't noticed it.   But there are so many concepts built in there that sometimes seem counter-intuitive but have been proven through research to be effective.  Colley's Principle comes to mind.<br><br>One author that includes a lot of research is Charles Duhigg - The Power of Habit.  And he combines it with a practical method for establishing new habits.   Great book.<br><br>There are a lot of books that are somewhere in the middle.  Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's book on "Flow" is like that.   He starts with some very interesting research, and comes to some very valuable conclusions.   But then he spends the remaining 80% of the book extending the concepts into areas where they really aren't applicable, basically claiming that the "Flow" concept is the foundation the complete happiness of the human race.  (I don't think I am exaggerating!)</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>17 December 2015 at 0:53 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Seraphim - <br><br>My problem with research - particularly in the fields of mental health, social psychology and productivity - is that much of it is probably bunk.
