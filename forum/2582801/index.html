I will bet you, 99 times out of a hundred they will look at their watch again to tell you what the time is. <br><br>Why? <br><br>I have read research that shows the majority of people prefer analogue watches because we don't actually look at a watch to see what the time is, we look to see how long it is till something. Or since something. And for that usage an analogue watch works far better visually, as we don't have to make any mathematical computations.

(or "for what is time used?" to all the grammar trolls). <br><br>You may perceive time as linear, however that is only relevant to watch design if you were given a digital chronograph at the moment of your birth and watched the time endlessly accumulate for the rest of your life. Functionally, your life is a series of cycles; of sleeping and waking, going to work and going home, eating at the right intervalls, etc. The sun goes up, the sun goes down, the seasons march around and around, and our actions are modified cyclically in response to these. <br><br>That said, there is nothing inherently intuitive in any timekeeping interface. Digital, analogue, sun &amp; moon, wandering-hour, differential dial, binary, sundial, water-clock, etc. These are all systems that we learn in order to get on with doing the useful things in our life.<br><br>For me, the conventional analogue 12-hour dial works best. Digital is OK too, but for that I prefer 24 hour time. My eldest son struggles with analogue, so I bought him a digital. My youngest son prefers hands on a dial.

It's as if the digital readout triggers the analogue mental image, and the mental image is what's used to see the time.<br><br>This 'conversion' is immediate, and, thinking about it, I notice that I can't NOT see the analogue equivalent.  Eg it's now 19:10 on my computer, and when I read that I mentally, for a split second, see an hour hand which is 5 hours away from midnight, and that gives me the sense of how late in the day it is, which is why I glanced at the time on the computer.<br><br>Maybe  it comes down to which ones you were most exposed to as a child when you're still forming patterns.  Maybe something to do with language areas in the brain.  Just as English is natural and French is still something I have to manually process.  I grew up with analogue clocks and watches.  The first digital watch I saw later on had red 7-segment LEDs, and I had a radio clock which had a blue-green 7-segment vaccum fluorescent display.<br><br>Chris</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 March 2016 at 19:18 | Chris</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Same here -- I have a much more visceral reaction to an analog clock face than a digital one.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>21 March 2016 at 1:34 | Seraphim</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Chris:<br><br>&lt;&lt; If I see a digital time it's also instant but I notice that I've immediately 'seen' the analogue equivalent in my head.

It takes far longer to describe, and is not something I have to work out, I just look at a digital time and it's already all happened.

I was taught in design school many years ago that 30 degrees was the minimum angle difference between two objects in order to make the difference appear intentional. In other words, to rotate a line of words "uphill" in a design, it should be at least 30 degrees off horizontal. A smaller angle difference runs the risk of being perceived as random or simply "off". <br><br>Of course, this is just a perceptual guideline, most likely based on design gestalt principles, but I think it's a valid guideline. <br><br>Perhaps this is why when asked for the time and looking at an analog watch, the answer is often rounded to the nearest 5 minutes, which is also the nearest 30 degree mark. I know when I look at an analog face, I see the minute hand in relation to those 30 degree spots. I see 9:29 as "9:30, but a little less".</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 April 2016 at 14:32 | Scott Moehring</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Scott:<br><br>&lt;&lt; Perhaps this is why when asked for the time and looking at an analog watch, the answer is often rounded to the nearest 5 minutes, which is also the nearest 30 degree mark.

The first is when you are asked for the time and have to verbalize the reply. The second is when you look at the watch purely in order to see what the time is. My contention is that in the second case you simply see the time without any need to translate it into words.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>28 April 2016 at 15:27 | Mark Forster</div> </li> </ul>  </div> </body></html>
