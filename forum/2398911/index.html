I usually plan to run my Evening Checklist, which consists (in part) of filing papers, zeroing my non-work email inbox, initializing my (MoT) list for tomorrow, and resetting my daily checklists. It usually only takes a few minutes, and I feel much better next morning if I do all this the night before. But I often don't do it, and thus feel unfocused and frenzied in the a.m.<br><br>So I'm looking for suggestions to motivate this habit.<br><br>I'd also like to know how y'all close out your days. Do you have an evening routine? Do you take a break from your system or list at a certain hour?<br><br>Please comment.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2014 at 20:07 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi,<br><br>I am in similar strigts as you are Ubi. I have a morning routine I call FTF (First things first) and an evening routine called LTL (last things last)<br><br>My LTL list is basically my FTF list in reverse, I make sure first that all critical things are done, then I look at what is critical tomorrow, then I process email. then papers, then go home. <br><br>But like you I usally go home first and do the above in the morning as part of my FTF. Now that I have been timeboxing my FTF along with two other tasks (see the SMEMA thread) I have been getting through FTF in a less stressful way, so maybe it makes LTL less important. <br><br>Or maybe I wil get to it today!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2014 at 20:47 | vegheadjones</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I tend to stop using my system an hour or two before bedtime to have some relaxed, unstructured time. I do have an evening routine, but it does not consist of system-maintenance stuff like that. It is a combination of religious things (prayer, self-examination, reading) and the typical "brush teeth" and "set out clothes for tomorrow" sort of thing.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>20 August 2014 at 23:38 | Austin</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I prefer a mid-morning review.<br><br>First thing in the morning, I know what needs to be done. Usually it's routine work, sometimes it's something urgent. A review just distracts me.<br><br>(And if I'm already distracted, a mid-morning review helps me refocus before too much time has passed.)<br><br>After lunch I'm usually in the groove, although I might do a quick review if I think I'm sliding.<br><br>Reviewing at night revs me up. Either I'm disappointed at all I didn't do, or excited about all I'll accomplish tomorrow (which keeps me up, so I accomplish nothing tomorrow).<br><br>My evening routine is pretty short. I usually prepare for the next day during the day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>22 August 2014 at 20:54 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>“Allow not sleep to close your wearied eyes, until you have reckoned up each daytime deed:<br><br>‘Where did I go wrong? <br><br>What did I do? <br><br>And what duty’s left undone?’<br><br>From first to last review your acts and then eprove yourself for wretched [or cowardly] acts, but rejoice in those done well.”<br><br>Epictetus, Discourses 3.10.2-3<br><br>What can you learn from the day and, where appropriate, how can you do better in the future?

Did I awake spiritual, and was I watchful in keeping my mind from wandering this morning when I was rising?<br><br>2. Have I this day got nearer to God in times of prayer, or have I given way to a lazy, idle spirit?<br><br>3. Has my faith been weakened by unwatchfulness, or quickened by diligence this day?<br><br>4. Have I this day walked by faith and eyed God in all things?<br><br>5. Have I denied myself in all unkind words and thoughts? Have I delighted in seeing others preferred before me?<br><br>6. Have I made the most of my precious time, as far as I had light, strength and opportunity?<br><br>7. Have I kept the issues of my heart in the means of grace, so as to profit by them?<br><br>8. What have I done this day for the souls and bodies of God’s dear saints?<br><br>9. Have I laid out anything to please myself when I might have saved the money for the cause of God?<br><br>10. Have I governed well my tongue this day, remembering that in a multitude of words there wanteth not sin?<br><br>11. In how many instances have I denied myself this day?<br><br>12.

In my own thinking I separate busyness, from productive creatiion, from "the grand goal" of what type of man I become. I suppose they could all go into an AF list, but at present I regard them separately.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 September 2014 at 15:23 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>michael:<br><br>I've come under fire on this forum before for suggesting that we are all equally busy. What I mean by that is that we all fill 24 hours a day with *something*. If we all wrote down exactly what we'd done today, the total for each one of us would add up to 24 hours. <br><br>Some people would have longer lists of items that they had done, but that would only be because the individual items were shorter in duration than those of the person who had fewer items on their list.<br><br>The only question therefore is not how much in terms of quantity got done - that's the same for everyone - but what the *quality* of what got done was.<br><br>If you find that your AF list produces rubbish, then that's because you've put rubbish on your AF list. If you want your AF list to produce "productive creation", then put productive creation type items on your AF list.<br><br>In answer to Austin's request for more information about the systems in my new book, I can say that the time management system I'm proposing in it (only a tiny fraction of the book) highlights this question of quality to a much greater extent.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>6 September 2014 at 15:36 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark: It's intriguing that good use of time for some people seems to be quantity of tasks ticked off. We have to wean ourselves off the idea that this is accomplishment, or productive creation. Perhaps this is just a modern sense of rush, constant stimulation, and the anxieties that come with it. At least one neuroscientist ( <a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d8216222-2170-11e4-a958-00144feabdc0.html">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d8216222-2170-11e4-a958-00144feabdc0.html</a> ) argues that digital technologies are changing our thinking and behaviour by limiting time for assimilation and reflection.<br><br>Reminders about quality of time use cannot be overdone. Two hours fishing or golfing, sitting outside a cafe, an art gallery visit. These are gratifying and beneficial, even if not energetic, dynamic and thrusting. I look forward to seeing how you mitigate the impression of time management as haste and urgency.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2014 at 10:35 | michael</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>michael:<br><br>&lt;&lt; At least one neuroscientist argues that digital technologies are changing our thinking and behaviour by limiting time for assimilation and reflection. &gt;&gt;<br><br>The reviewer seemed to think that some of the neuroscientist's more wide-ranging conclusions were unwarranted by the evidence. <br><br>&lt;&lt; Two hours fishing or golfing, sitting outside a cafe, an art gallery visit. &gt;&gt;<br><br>One of the advantages of being as old as I am is that I can remember what life was like before the digital revolution - before even television. And no we didn't spend our time assimilating and reflecting. We spent acres of time being profoundly bored. Whatever the disadvantages of the modern age are - and there are plenty - I think life is much more enjoyable for the average person nowadays.<br><br>In the late 1950s when I was in my early teens fishing was very expensive, there were far less golf courses than there are now, cafes simply didn't have seats outside - that was unheard of - and art galleries were gloomy places still firmly entrenched in the Victorian era with most of the pictures uncleaned for centuries.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>7 September 2014 at 11:52 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Michael,<br>You stated:<br>"from "the grand goal" of what type of man I become. I suppose they could all go into an AF list, but at present I regard them separately."<br><br>Your character and passions are who you are.  They are what's writing your to do list.<br><br>In reference to leisure time and passions and loved ones, since I'm always challenged to surmount the boredom associated with meeting my responsibilities, I write a WILL DO list of the most important responsibilities to get out of the way so that my mind and body is free to embark on my discretionary time unfettered with nagging.  When I do lapse, the quality of my own time is greatly hampered by the nagging/worry.  I don't worry too much about systems and rules.  I choose a WILL DO list that is intended to satisfy my need to feel responsible and timely (because that's my character.  The nagging is simply a reminder that I've gone astray.)<br><br>This way, I'm aligned with my character traits, my responsibilities and passions....even if my passion at the time is lying down on the sofa and listening to John Coltrane. I can totally immerse my body and mind into the reverie because I'm overall current with the responsibilities.
