But this works best with a grouping of 7 items per page (as such) due to the graphical nature of the software (bubble map).   So in effect I would have a lot  more pages but with fewer items.  Do you think this would still work? Or do you think the list size would be too small.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 19:36 | Steve Wynn</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I haven't tested this out, but my feeling would be that the smaller the number of items on a page, the less well the autofocus effect would work. I started off using unruled sheets of paper on which I could get about 25 items. Once I switched to my present 34 item notepad, I felt a definite increase in the ease of working the system. That may of course have been affected by my greater knowledge of the system.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 20:44 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark,<br><br>Could you elaborate for us on how the "ease" of working improved for you by upping the item limit? <br><br>I work with Autofocus electronically and so, obviously, there is no limit to how many items could go on an electronic page. I've been limiting myself to about 30 items per electronic page in line with the Autofocus instructions but am interested by your comment that a 10 item increase has made things easier.<br><br>I wonder if there is an optimum number of items per page? <br><br>Too many and I guess you're heading towards an open list, whereas too few might bring back a pile of resistance because you are having to tackle tough items too quickly.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 21:45 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Frank:<br><br>For a start you need less pages. At the moment I have 16 active pages. If I had only had 7 lines to a page as Steve is proposing, the items would have been spread over 77 pages! That means to do just one pass through my complete list I would have to work on or dismiss  a minimum of 77 items. <br><br>I think that would bring the whole system to a grinding halt. You could radically reduce the number of tasks you allow into the system, but if you do that you have changed the whole nature of autofocus, because you would be pre-selecting with your rational mind instead of letting autofocus sift the tasks.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 22:49 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Mark, <br><br>I see your point and I'm now wondering if I should prepare to seriously boost up my page sizes.<br><br>I'm up to 13 active pages just through organic growth and will shortly (when I process the appropriate AF task!) be adding possibly a few hundred more items coming from previously unprocessed electronic GTD inboxes and dusty, old GTD Someday/Maybe lists.<br><br>It sounds like page size (for an electronic approach) should really be adjusted to limit yourself to some maximum number of pages, say, 15 or so...which is the minimum number of items you think you could comfortably pass through in a day.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>8 January 2009 at 23:21 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi Mark,<br><br>I tried a quick test - it didn't feel the same because the choices were so limited. So I am going to stick to my MLO implementation of 25 items per page. At the moment I find this is working well. I may increase that number later on.<br><br>All the best<br><br>Steve</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 1:21 | Steve Wynn</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Frank:<br><br>I don't think there is any need for a limit on page numbers because you can pass through a page very quickly indeed, as I say in my blog post about Speed of Movement. However if you dump a whole load of tasks which have been hanging around for a long time into the system, be prepared for it to reject a large proportion of them.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 8:36 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>How about using Date of Entry instead of Page as the collective entity i.e. in Mark's instructions, substitute "date of entry" for "page"?  So all the Autofocus entries you made in a day are separated from those of the next day by a line underneath (or by giving each day its own page if this is more convenient).<br><br>I can see two advantages: it would give a direct record of how long each task has been on the list, and it could easily be included in day-based electronic or paper diary systems such as page-per-day diaries.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 11:10 | John Wilson</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>John,<br><br>If you were to do it that way then how would you deal with the situation where, for example, you only made one entry on a particular day for some reason. Wouldn't that defeat the Autofocus approach?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 11:54 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I'm doing really well with 35 items to a page (sheet on Excel) - obviously I will hit a limit one day on the number of sheets, just as I would with a notebook, but I will just set up an archive workbook for expired sheets (I guess I can archive immediately any sheet where everything is crossed off rather than highlighted).  35 is the number you can see on my screen without scrolling so it works well.<br><br>I think the system needs to be unchanged from the original ideas for it to work properly - I just use electronics to mimic the paper system.  It's too soon in the testing process to be introducing new ideas.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 12:08 | Anne Bennett</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Frank<br>One entry per day would be just like having only one entry on a page in the present AF system, which you would presumably treat like any other page. A day with only one entry would be treated like any other day.<br><br>In the context of the earlier posts, I can see that if there were only a few entries per day for a number of days, you might end up with a larger number of active "Dates of Entry" to survey, but with so few entries in the first place you are unlikely to be overwhelmed.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 12:29 | John Wilson</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Anne,<br><br>As I understand it, there is no limit on the number of worksheets you can have in an Excel workbook (assuming your computer's memory size can handle it) so you'll probably not need the archive workbook just yet. &lt;grin&gt;</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 12:31 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>John,<br><br>I understand what you are saying about how to treat a single entry. However, the Autofocus approach, as I've experienced it so far, relies on you having a significant number (around 25-35) of tasks on a page to begin which, after a number of passes, gradually reduces.<br><br>The point is that there will likely be a number of relatively "easy" tasks on the page to begin with which you gradually buiild up momentum (over a number of passes) towards the more difficult tasks.<br><br>If you start with just a few tasks (or even one task) on a page, you are going to end up immediately dismissing tasks you don't want to (because they NEED to done but not just at that moment) or else you are going to build up a load of resistance about that page...and then back comes the procrastination.<br><br>Or am I misunderstanding your suggestion?</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 12:41 | Frank</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Frank<br>I see not having enough tasks as a positive rather than a negative. I see the concern: there might not be enough tasks per Date of Entry: but again with so few tasks the system would be manageable anyway, if it were necessary at all. If there were really so few, and you were determined to use AF, the days could be grouped into say weeks (or simply pages). <br><br>In my own case I would have many tasks per date of entry, roughly enough to fill a page, which I would guess is the more common situation.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 13:03 | John Wilson</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>John<br><br>Surely the whole beauty of Autofocus is that by starting each page with the same number of tasks (apart from the last page where you're still entering tasks of course) it allows your rational mind and your instinct to work together to choose what to do next (the task that 'stands out'). If you start fiddling with the basic, well tested, premise and end up with a number of pages STARTING out with only a few entries per page then this whole process never gets off the ground.<br><br>Once you've done several cycles of your pages and there are only a few items left on the page you then get to see whether you are resisting doing any of those tasks, or if there's another reason they're still there. If you're feeling resistance you can start to analyze why and either rephrase, break them down into smaller chunks, dismiss them or figure out any other reason for the resistance. However, I would think starting with fewer tasks and not having consistant starting quantities on your pages would stop this from happening. With only a few tasks to start with you may feel resistance straight away which doesn't seem to happen when you have a page of mixed easy and harder tasks (as well as the chipping away effect you get from doing A bit at A time).<br><br>Just my two pennyworth...</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 13:57 | Hannah</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hannah<br>I do not disagree, but if you use Date of Entry as the collective entity, as I was proposing, that would not mean that you have only "a few entries per date". I suspect that there would be many per day, certainly enough for Autofocus to work. What to do with only a few entries per date or per page is a different issue.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 16:25 | John Wilson</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I agree with Hannah that the fact that pages are of the same size helps AF to flow well, and provides a reasonable number of items for the intuitive side of us to work on.  The work we are doing on any given day and any number of factors will inevitably impact upon the numbers of items - in just this one week where some days I can work on AF all day and others have very restricted time, the numbers of new items per day varied from half a page to 3 and a half pages.  If one of my lists was three and a half pages long and I only did one item then the rotation element could easily be lost. <br><br>My suggestion would be to try it as written - if you then try it on a date basis I think you will see the difference ..........</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 18:06 | Christine B</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I would agree with Christine. I did consider making the system "per day" instead of "per page" when I was first developing it, but concluded that "per page" would be much more effective. The main reason for this is that some days I could easily add several hundred tasks, and some days only a few.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>9 January 2009 at 18:52 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I  may need to know the date of tasks , I just skip one line and write the date so I can have this information if needed.
