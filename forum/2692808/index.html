It sounds like what you are doing, in effect, is continuous DDD - i.e. making a decision on each task as you scan by once whether it should remain active for the next pass. If you add a fourth D (Delay to later today), and do continuous DDDD, then you can delete a lot of stuff and move everything that doesn't stand out now either off-list (Defer) or to the end of the list (Delay). This approach would shorten the list and keep everything contiguous. <br><br>I recommend Delete as a default action if your list is too long. A lot of tasks just don't need to be on the list when you know you're not going to take any action on them soon. Trust yourself that you will remember to enter such tasks again when they are ripe.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 November 2017 at 20:08 | ubi</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Hi ubi, thanks for useful comments.<br><br>I try and do as many tasks as I can on the first pass and only defer tasks when absolutely necessary. e.g waiting on someone else.<br><br>Also, nothing gets on the list if it does not need to be done. It is long enough already!<br><br>I also have a "today" marker as well which would work similar to your Delay to Later Today. I use that for urgents.<br><br>I'm hoping to achieve just one scan on a task and action it there and then and have a marker for deferred tasks so I can forget about them until a later time. I suppose that is similar to the defer bit of Real autofocus, but using a marker instead of the admin time of trying to move the task somehow into a calendar.<br><br>I think a system needs to be developed to achieve absolute minimum admin time and then it will truly be fast.</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>1 November 2017 at 20:54 | MrBaclog</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>nuntym:<br><br>&lt;&lt; It simply is not flexible enough; heck Seraphim had to add a "no list" system into it. &gt;&gt;<br><br>Actually it's the other way around. My default system is "no list". It's only when I feel I'm not getting traction with "no list" that I turn to Random RAF. I find "no list" to be engaging and flow-inducing like the "standing out" methods, but even more so, at a higher and deeper level. <br><br>Random RAF is a great backup system, it keeps things moving when I'm having a hard time focusing, it selects things I might otherwise be ignoring or resisting, and it quickly clears away the dross. But I don't like using it for starting my day, it feels far too restrictive. Actually, compared to no-list, *all* long-list systems feel artificial and restrictive to me, even "Simple Scanning".<br><br>A while back, Mark was searching for systems that were "fast, flexible, and systematic". <br><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/12/18/systematic-fast-and-flexible.html">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/12/18/systematic-fast-and-flexible.html</a><br><br>No-list systems are fast and flexible but not very systematic. Random RAF is fast and systematic but not flexible. The combination works really well for me.

However it's the easiest to measure. But what is far more important is how long it takes for all tasks in the system at a certain moment in time to be actioned. Using the number of tasks allows one to get a good picture of that.<br><br>The problem with your idea is that "doing any task one after another in no particular order" is very far from being 100% efficient. It takes no account of the fact that different tasks need to be done with different frequencies, some tasks can't be done at certain times or locations, one's energy levels are higher at certain times of day, and many other variables.<br><br>&lt;&lt; procrastinating, resisting, day dreaming &gt;&gt;<br><br>These refer more to the speed of the operator than to the speed of the system!</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 November 2017 at 17:50 | Mark Forster</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>I often count in Points, from Agile Programming, rather than hours or lines. (Well, something like points. It's easier to describe the official system.)<br><br>https://www.sitepoint.com/whats-point-agile-points/<br><br>Start with the best guess of hours for an average programmer. Rather than agonize over  1.75 or 2 hours, pick one of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 21 (Fibonnaci sequence). Actual hours of work, after subtracting interruptions. (4-6 is typical). Break down projects enough so there are no surprises.<br><br>Ann Average takes 1 hour to do 1 point. Sam Student takes 2. Ethel Expert takes 1/2. Assign tasks and plan the sprint accordingly. (Those numbers will change over time, as people get faster or slower. It gets more complicated if there are different skill sets. Ann might take 21 hours to research something Larry from Legal can do in 1. Or Sam is faster in the new language than Ethel.)<br><br>After a few cycles, stop thinking of hours.<br><br>Mark said that what he used to consider a very productive day is now not so impressive, he might have started at only 2 points a day (like Sam Student), and now he's more like Ethel. Or maybe his boss learned to keep the daily meeting short, so he can do more points per day.<br><br>If something goes faster than expected, take credit for the points completed, but next time use the new knowledge to make a better estimate.<br><br>If something takes longer, take credit for the time it actually took. (1/2 hour per point for Joe, 2 hours per point for Ethel.) (Did I flip those?) Also increase the total goal for the sprint. (Then look at the remaining points for the sprint and, if it's not realistic to finish them all, decide which ones get deferred to the next sprint.)<br><br>+++<br><br>I inflate the points of things I'm resisting. It started as a reward, but now I see it's realistic. It might take only an hour to do the task, but before the task I spend time resisting, and after I need time to rest. If I want my estimates to be accurate, I need to use the real me, not the ideal one.<br><br>Burnup charts are useful. Points vs day. Top line is the total points for the sprint. Bottom is points finished. Difference is points remaining. If the total goal changes, the top line bends. Burndown charts only show work remaining, and don't show whether the problem is increase in goal or a slow day.<br><br>https://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/6529/how-does-one-build-a-burnup-chart</div> <div class="signature" data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>3 November 2017 at 18:22 | Cricket</div> </li><li data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v> <div data-astro-cid-oh4y2s7v>Errata:<br><br>4-6 is typical number of points per day, for average programmer.<br><br>Burnup chart: Top line is total goal for the sprint, which might change over the sprint if the customer changes his mind, or you realize you're behind.
